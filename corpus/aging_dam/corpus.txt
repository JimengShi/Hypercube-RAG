They are concerned the Sanford Dam, located a few miles northwest of the city and downstream of the Edenville Dam, will also fail.Some drove to the school at 1301 Eastlawn Drive to seek shelter. Others were brought in by bus. Among those who came was Elvera Ilgenfritz, who arrived with her dog Sophie, a Maltese.“My son called and they told us to go to the mall, then the police at the mall told us to come here,” said Ilgenfritz, seated on a bench within the school. “I grabbed her dog food and her bowls, threw in some clothes, my medication. Took some papers out of my safe, some clothes. Nothing seemed important. Nothing seemed important. It’s in God’s hands.”94Gov. Whitmer delivers remarks as Midland experiences major floodingAbout 8:15 p.m., Midland Public Schools Superintendent Michael Sharrow said the residents were arriving ahead of the American Red Cross, which was bringing cots and other supplies. He said he was expecting 100 cots.By 8:45 p.m., the cots hadn’t arrived and he expected they’d need more than 100.Shawn Burkett said he knew he had to leave his home on M-20 when firefighters arrived at his door.“The fire department showed up at my door and said we needed to evacuate,” he said. “Originally, the plan was for the mall, then they relocated everyone here because it’s higher ground.”Burkett made the trip with some roommates.“I’m just shook up,” he said. “I didn’t really bringing anything beside what I needed. Something to drink and my cigarettes and that was it.”Midland High School served as a refuge site for Midland residents displaced by the Edenville Dam failure on May 19, 2020.Rebecca and Steve Malkin, seated on bleachers in the school’s gymnasium, said they left their Sanford home a few minutes before 7 p.m.“We packed up in about 10 minutes and came directly here,” Rebecca Malkin said. “Or, as directly as we could. It was slow going.”They drove separate vehicles, not wanting to leave one in their garage in case it ended up being flooded.The Malkins were following developments via news reports and media alerts.“We knew what was going on and just decided we should probably leave,” Rebecca Malkin said. “We saw the neighbor leaving and thought we should go.”In their haste to leave, they forgot to bring their coronavirus-recommended face masks and gloves, but they were able to acquire new ones at the high school.“I brought my genealogy; I didn’t want to lose all that business,” Rebecca Malkin said. “We brought some lockboxes and a blanket in case we have to spend the night some place. We brought our meds, my laptop, my tablet, and my cellphone. That was pretty much it.”“We don’t know what we’re gonna come home to,” Steve Malkin added. “If we got a home.”Others at the school were not there out of necessity, but out of charity. Richard Groves, standing beside his truck bed in the parking lot, was not required to leave his home. He showed up to the school to donate 10 cases of bottled water for those in need.“Just went to the store and bought some water to give to these folks,” he said.Tyler Brown is an employee of Independent Community Living, an adult foster care center at 233 E. Larkin St. in Midland. He was still on duty while at the school.“I got the message on my phone … and my job called everybody and told us where to evacuate to, how to get to it, everything like that,” Brown said. As with Ilgenfritz and Burkett, Brown initially went to the Midland Mall before being rerouted to the high school.“Our job is amazing at keeping everybody safe and informed about where to go,” he continued. He wasn’t able to say how many people he brought with him to the site.Jaye Collins and Charley Kinzel live at Riverside Place Senior Living Community at 400 E. Main St. They learned of the evacuation via their building’s public address system. Kinzel estimated it took about five minutes to gather up some necessities.“I’m wondering where everybody else was that was coming here,” Collins said. “They cleared out Riverside, really.”“Most of the people either had friends or relatives or still had their house in town,” Kinzel said. “They just either went back home or are staying with their sons or daughters.”Asked for his overall thoughts on the ordeal, Kinzel was philosophical.“That’s life,” he said with a chuckle. “It’s no big deal.”Related:Sanford Dam collapse imminent, Midland County residents urged to evacuateResidents told to evacuate after Edenville Dam failure in Midland CountyGov.

About 20 homes were moved from their foundations and several trailers washed away amid flooding in western Virginia from the remnants of Hurricane Ida. (Bristol Virginia Professional FireFighters Assn. ) By MARK SCOLFORO Associated Press Sept. 1, 2021 4:46 PM PT FacebookTwitterShow more sharing optionsShareClose extra sharing options Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Email Copy Link URLCopied!Print HARRISBURG, Pa. — Soaking rains from the remnants of Hurricane Ida prompted the evacuations of thousands of people Wednesday after water reached dangerous levels at a dam near Johnstown, Pa.The storm moved east in the evening, with the National Weather Service confirming at least one tornado and social media posts showing homes blown to rubble and roofs torn from buildings in a southern New Jersey county just outside Philadelphia.Pennsylvania was blanketed with rain after high water drove some from their homes in Maryland and Virginia. The storm killed one person, two people were not accounted for, and a tornado was believed to have touched down along the Chesapeake Bay in Maryland.Ida caused countless school and business closures in Pennsylvania. About 150 roadways maintained by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation were closed and many smaller roadways also were impassable. Some 18,000 customers were without power, including some 12,000 in central Pennsylvania.Some areas near Johnstown, whose history includes several deadly floods, saw 5 inches or more of rain by midafternoon, an inundation that triggered an evacuation order for those downstream from the Wilmore Dam. AdvertisementCambria County emergency management director and 911 center head Art Martynuska said the water level at the Wilmore Dam reached a height that required evacuation. Nearby Hinckston Run Dam was also being monitored but appeared stable by late afternoon, he said, by which time water levels at Wilmore Dam were receding. “If that trend continues we’ll be allowing folks to return back to their residences shortly, hopefully by this evening,” Martynuska said.Both dams were considered high-hazard dams that are likely to threaten lives were they to fail. Evacuees were taken to a nearby high school with help from the Red Cross, National Guard, local transit authority and school transportation services, Martynuska said.The 1889 Johnstown flood killed 2,200 people, a disaster blamed on poor maintenance on the South Fork Dam on the Little Conemaugh River. It sent a 36-foot wall of water roaring into a populated area at 40 mph.The National Weather Service had predicted flooding from what remained of Hurricane Ida, saying steep terrain and even city streets were particularly vulnerable to a band of severe weather that extended from the Appalachians into Massachusetts.Flash flooding knocked about 20 homes off their foundations and washed several trailers away in Virginia’s mountainous western corner, where about 50 people were rescued and hundreds were evacuated. News outlets reported that one person was unaccounted for in the small mountain community of Hurley.Water had almost reached the ceilings of basement units when crews arrived at an apartment complex in Rockville, Md., on Wednesday. A 19-year-old was found dead, another person was missing, and about 200 people from 60 apartments near Rock Creek were displaced, Montgomery County Fire Chief Scott Goldstein said Wednesday.“In many years I have not seen circumstances like this,” Goldstein said. Tropical Storm Larry was strengthening and moving quickly westward after forming off the coast of Africa earlier Wednesday. Forecasters predicted it would rapidly intensify in a manner similar to Ida, becoming a major hurricane with top wind speeds of 120 mph by Saturday. Kate remained a tropical depression and was expected to weaken without threatening land. World & Nation Newsletter Must-read stories from the L.A.

Partners University of Washington provides funding as a member of The Conversation US. View all partners Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger Brazilian rescue workers continue searching for more than 300 people missing after a dam burst at an iron ore mine over the weekend. The dam, which ruptured on Jan. 25 close to the Brazilian town of Brumadinho, Minas Gerais state, released a muddy sludge of watery mine waste that engulfed buildings, vehicles and roads. At least 65 people are confirmed dead, and the official toll will rise as the missing are declared dead. The catastrophe has exposed the dangers of Brazil’s aging dam system. A recent government report found nearly 1,800 dams in Brazil at high or moderate risk of failure. The figure is all the more stunning because the report’s authors evaluated just one-fifth of Brazil’s nearly 24,000 registered dams. Brazil’s unsafe dams Dams are an environmentally and economically risky business, as our global research on hydropower and many other studies have shown. Beyond the loss of human life, the economic damages of a dam breach can soar into the billions. An entire region’s natural and cultural heritage may be decimated by flooding, and the freshwater ecosystems that humans and fish alike rely on compromised. Yet dozens of countries worldwide, including the United States and Canada, use dams to store water, generate electricity and trap mine waste, or “tailings.” And there’s no easy or cheap way to dismantle or fix aging dams. The Brumadinho dam collapse is the second dam accident in Brazil involving one of the world’s largest iron ore producers, Vale S.A., in recent years. In November 2015, two of Vale S.A.‘s tailings dams – that is, dams used to contain the watery runoff of nearby mines – also collapsed in Minas Gerais state, where some mountains are made almost entirely of iron ore. That disaster killed 19 people and spewed over 10 billion gallons of water and mine sediment downstream, contaminating 441 miles of Brazil’s Rio Doce river before reaching the Atlantic Ocean. It is considered the country’s worst environmental tragedy ever. Reuters Repairing broken dams in Brazil can cost between US40,000 and 10 million per dam, according to Brazil’s national water authority. That is a financial hurdle for a country that has been in deep recession since 2015. But the social, economic and environmental costs of letting old dams fail may be higher. Reducing the risk of dam failure The environmental damage is particularly acute when tailings dams collapse, since the large amounts of mining waste they release is highly toxic. Of the roughly 3,500 tailings dams worldwide, over 300 collapse each year. Two to five of those are “major” failures like Brazil’s. Prompted by this impending danger, the United Nations Environmental Program recently issued recommendations for enhancing tailings dam safety around the world. Mining companies should strive for zero-failure, it said, warning that “safety attributes should be evaluated separately from economic considerations, and cost should not be the determining factor.” The report also suggests the creation of a global database of mine sites and tailings storage facilities to better track, and ultimately predict, dam failures. When old dams have become too costly to maintain or repair, removal is generally considered the best course. Dismantling old dams, as the United States and Europe are increasingly doing, also restores freshwater ecosystems that have been impacted by decades of damming. Brazil is considering decommissioning at least one dam, in the country’s north, due to biodiversity concerns and because it no longer efficiently produces hydroelectricity. Since the country has federal guidelines regulating the treatment of old dams, the decision about whether to repair, dismantle or continue operating dams is largely left to state officials. Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro has promised to further deregulate the mining industry. That setup, we fear, leaves the country ill-equipped to deal with its impending dam crisis. Rescue workers at Brazil’s Brumadinho dam collapse in protective gear. The sludge released in the disaster contained iron ore mine waste. Reuters/Washington Alves Technological improvements To increase the safety of its mines, Brazil and other countries could look beyond dams for storing iron ore waste. New technology has created some promising alternative solutions. These include approaches that create a paste of thickened mine tailings, which may then be stored either above ground or in impermeable plastic sheathes below the surface. This method both makes it less likely that the contamination seeps into the ground. It also reduces water use. However, it is expensive. Constructed and engineered wetlands can also act as treatment systems – a kind of faux natural filter. Wetlands are affordable to build and operate and require relatively little maintenance. Technology can enhance their natural capacity to remove contamination from wastewater. However, mines must have sufficient available land to support wetlands, and the these systems – like all wetlands – don’t work as efficiently during cold winter months. Every mine is uniquely situated in terms of its geography, physical setting, environmental context and human population. None of these waste-storage systems alone will make tailings dams obsolete. But Brazil’s Brumadinho dam collapse is the world’s latest reminder of the risk posed by old and unsafe dams. With national safety guidelines informed by science and stricter enforcement, countries can reduce the chance of a disaster like this happening again.

The College Lake Dam has been strained by heavy rainfall. Overnight, worries about its imminent collapse sent alarm through the community. National Concerns Of Dam Failure Prompt Evacuations In Lynchburg, Va. Facebook Twitter Flipboard Email August 3, 20181:58 PM ET Camila Domonoske Twitter Updated at 2:22 p.m. ET More than a hundred households have been evacuated from their homes in Lynchburg, Va., after heavy rains amid concerns that an aging dam might fail and unleash dangerous floodwaters. Video posted by the city overnight showed water flowing over the dam and into Blackwater Creek. LuAnn Hunt, a city spokeswoman, tells NPR that 94 people took shelter at a local high school that is serving as an evacuation center. They will remain there "until our weather event has passed and our dam is stabilized," she says. Other residents are staying with family and friends; in total, about 120 households have been evacuated, the city says. Engineers have been assessing the situation at College Lake Dam. "Currently, they have found no seepage at the dam so it is considered stable," Jes Gearing, public information officer for Lynchburg Water Resources, said in a statement emailed to NPR. "We are developing a plan to stabilize the dam which may include opening the sluice gate at the dam to reduce the water levels." Once the water level drops, emergency repairs can begin to restore the dam's stability, she says. Environment As Technology Marches On, Reservoir Caretakers Stay At Their Posts Last night, the National Weather Service warned that the worst-case scenario — a complete dam collapse — could send 17 feet of water into the central Virginia city in just seven minutes. By Friday, the threat was less severe, NWS forecaster Nick Fillo tells NPR. "The conditions have improved," he says. "After the heavy rain that fell yesterday evening, we just had some light to moderate rain, which hasn't really added to the problem." Authorities were still being cautious. On Friday, the National Weather Service told residents that "the threat for dam failure continues" and the flash flood warning remains in effect. Lynchburg, with a population of around 80,000, is home to a number of colleges and universities, including the University of Lynchburg (previously Lynchburg College), which owns the lake the dam is located on. Liberty University, the Christian university founded by Jerry Falwell, is also located in Lynchburg. The dam was built in the early 1930s and, like many dams in the U.S., doesn't meet current safety standards. National Aging And Underfunded: America's Dam Safety Problem, In 4 Charts In 2011, Virginia's Department of Conservation and Recreation identified the College Lake Dam as one of the state's "high-hazard" dams. Since 2014, the City Council has been considering options for repairing or replacing the dam. Turner Perrow, a member of the Lynchburg City Council who is also a civil engineer, tells NPR that the dam presents "a complicated problem." A major road for the city crosses over top of the dam, which is located right next to the University of Lynchburg. The lake behind it is filled with silt, which complicates potential solutions: If the city removed the dam, for instance, it would need to ensure that the silt didn't cause other problems downstream. And every proposed fix would cost millions of dollars. It's a problem with fresh urgency. The city knew the dam couldn't handle 2 feet of rain, the maximum it was supposed to be able to cope with, Perrow says. But the crew monitoring the dam last night raised concerns about structural integrity after just about 6 inches of rain. "This dam is in worse shape than we thought it was," Perrow says. At the same time, he notes that "one of the opportunities coming out of this averted disaster is we may be able to tap federal funds for emergency preparedness to really fix the dam once and for all." Given the condition of the dam and the state of the lake, Perrow says, the most likely "fix" isn't actually a repair. He says the city is likely to tear the dam down completely and replace it with a bridge. dams infrastructure Weather Virginia flooding Facebook Twitter Flipboard Email Read & Listen Home News Culture Music Podcasts & Shows Connect Newsletters Facebook Twitter Instagram Press Contact & Help About NPR Overview Diversity Ethics Finances Public Editor Corrections Get Involved Support Public Radio Sponsor NPR NPR Careers NPR Shop NPR Events NPR Extra Terms of Use Privacy Your Privacy Choices Text Only Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

(NASA) Placeholder while article actions loadTorrential rains early this week proved too much for two major dams upstream of Midland, Michigan, a city of 40,000 people, to handle. On Tuesday, the Edenville dam collapsed while the downstream Sanford dam was overwhelmed, unleashing a gushing, record-setting surge of water into the city.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightTen thousand residents of Midland were told to evacuate after the Edenville dam failed and Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) declared a state of emergency.A dam in Edenville, Mich. collapsed on May 19 resulting in massive flooding across Midland County, Mich. (Video: The Washington Post)Satellite imagery from NASA and Maxar captured before and after this disaster shows the dramatic effects of the compromised dams and how the floodwaters transformed the landscape. Vast areas, including homes, businesses, ball fields, roadways, and bridges were engulfed.The Tittabawassee River, which the Edenville and Sanford dams help control, crested at 35 feet in Midland, its highest level on record, more than a foot above the previous high mark in 1986.Mich. governor says state will seek ‘legal recourse’ over failed damThe Maxar before and after scene below, shows the radical change at the Edenville dam after it collapsed:Here’s a YouTube clip of the on-the-ground footage of the dam’s disintegration:The dam’s demise is swift.Advertisement“The slope [of the dam] fails rapidly, initially forming a large toe bulge and there is major deformation at the crest,” writes landslide expert Dave Petley on the American Geophysical Union’s landslide blog, “The failure is rapid and mobile.”NASA imagery (below) reveals how the collapse of Edenville dam emptied the lake it protected upstream. Wixom Lake, once a local playground for boaters, is now essentially a giant beach.Notice how lake water, colored dark brown, is present upstream of the dam in the panel on the left (in the above image) before the dam is breached. But, on the panel on the right, the lake area is replaced by an earthy tone, indicative of sand, after the dam disintegrates.The drone footage below, captured by Midland resident Peter Sinclair, provides a close-up and stark view of what’s left of Wixom Lake along with the flooding of nearby areas.

(Image credit: Randy Pench/Sacramento Bee/Zuma Press) More than 100,000 people were evacuated from below the United States' tallest dam on Sunday, after an auxiliary floodway threatened to fail.The Oroville Dam in Northern California looked poised to release floodwaters from Lake Oroville into the Feather River, threatening thousands of homes and businesses. According to the Los Angeles Times, rains had filled the reservoir to capacity, sending water over the dam's emergency spillway for the first time. On Sunday (Feb. 12), a hole developed in the spillway, prompting the evacuation order. As of Sunday evening, the reservoir level had dropped enough to ease the pressure on the spillway, but more rain was forecast, triggering a race against time to repair the dam's spillways with sacks of rocks dropped by helicopter.   The situation is still dangerous, officials emphasize, and a look back at some of the most notable dam failures in history shows what's at stake. [Lessons From 10 of the Worst Engineering Disasters in US History] 1. Deadliest dam failureIn August 1975, Typhoon Nina rolled over Taiwan and headed for the Chinese mainland, where it collided with a cold front and dumped a massive amount of rain over Henan, a province in central China. What happened next was a 1-in-2,000-year flood.This rain swelled rivers and reservoirs, most notably the Banqiao Reservoir, which was held back by the Banqiao Dam. The dam was built in 1952 and had about only half of the sluice gates recommended by hydrologists, according to a 2013 history of the disaster in The Economic Observer, a Chinese newspaper. On Aug. 8, 1975, as local residents desperately tried to shore up the structure with sandbags, the dam collapsed. A wall of water rushed downstream, destroying 62 smaller dams in its path. Approximately 171,000 people were killed in the flood and its aftermath, making the Banqiao Dam disaster the deadliest dam failure in history.   2. Ancient engineeringRuins of the Great Dam on the Wadi Dhana, Ma'rib, Yemen. (Image credit: DeAgostini/Getty Images)For as long as humans have tried to harness waterways for their own uses, there have been failures. The Great Dam of Marib, in what is now Yemen, was an engineering marvel of the ancient world. Built around the eighth century B.C., the 2,100-foot-long (650 meters) mud dam held back a reservoir that formed the basis of a 39-square-mile (100 square kilometers) irrigation system, according to National Geographic (opens in new tab). The dam did its job for more than 1,000 years.But at some point in the mid-sixth century A.D., the dam was breached. The Koran describes the disaster as punishment for the tribe of Saba refusing to accept Allah."We sent upon them the flood of the dam, and We replaced their two [fields of] gardens with gardens of bitter fruit, tamarisks and something of sparse lote trees," the text reads.Whatever death or destruction the breach left behind is lost to history (as is the cause of the failure), but the impact on the civilization around the dam was dire. The loss of the irrigation system triggered a mass migration out of the area.That's the legend, at least. A paper published in 2000 in the Journal of Archaeological Science used radiocarbon dating of the sediments behind the dam and found that it may have collapsed much earlier than oral histories suggest, around the third century A.D., at the latest. The silting of the reservoir and the declining economic importance of the area as a caravan stop may have been as much of a death knell as the dam breach, the paper concluded. 3. First-time failureThe Teton Dam in Idaho was short-lived. This earthen dam was meant to generate hydroelectric power and irrigate southeastern Idaho. Instead, it collapsed the first time its reservoir was filled.The problem? Seepage. The geology under the dam was volcanic rhyolite, marked by extensive cracking and fissuring. The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, which built the dam, knew that below-ground seepage of water could occur through these fissures. However, engineers thought that injections of grout into the ground at the base of the dam could seal off the seeps.Not so much. As the reservoir approached capacity on the morning of June 5, 1976, small leaks began to pop up on the right side of the dam. By midmorning, a hole had formed in the dam face, and a whirlpool was swirling in the reservoir like water over the drain in a bathtub. A bulldozer sent to try to fill the hole sank into the hole instead, according to a 1992 article published in the Geological Society of London publication Geology Today.Just before noon, the dam failed, shooting 10,876 cubic feet (308 cubic meters) of water downstream. Fortunately, quick warnings led to hasty evacuations and only 11 people died in the flooding, though thousands of head of livestock and many homes were lost, according to the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation. Investigations afterward showed that the fissures under the dam, combined with the fluffy, not-so-impenetrable loess soil that made up the dam's core, led to the collapse. 4. Death in PennsylvaniaOn May 31, 1889, the South Fork Dam broke, unleashing 20 million tons of water from the artificial Lake Conemaugh. (Image credit: Andrews, E. Benjamin. History of the United States, volume V. Charles Scribner's Sons, New York. 1912.)The worst dam failure in U.S. history, however, was the Johnstown Flood. This 1889 disaster in Pennsylvania killed 2,209 people, including 396 children, according to the Johnstown Area Heritage Association. In 99 cases, entire families were wiped out together.According to a 1989 narrative of the flood, heavy rain had filled the streets of Johnstown with water on May 31, 1889, not an uncommon occurrence in the river valley town. But the rain that day was record-breaking, and the South Fork Dam upstream of Johnstown was crumbling. Local residents worked feverishly to dig a second spillway, clear debris from the first and add height to the dam, but it was all for naught. At around 3 p.m., the dam collapsed. A wall of water 40 feet (12 m) high thundered down the valley. In 2009, hydrologists calculated that 423,776 cubic feet (12,000 cubic m) of debris-choked water rushed down the valley per second. That's comparable to a low-flow day on the Mississippi River, but crammed into a narrow river valley.  5. Another California catastropheSt. Francis Dam before the 1928 failure on March 12 - 13, 1928 in Los Angeles County, California. (Image credit: Los Angeles Bureau of Power & Light/USGS)Water was the source of much controversy in California in the early 1900s. As Los Angeles grew, the city's water needs began to conflict with the needs of farmers in the eastern part of the state. The power struggles that arose from the need for water would go down in history as the California Water Wars — and wars they were. The Los Angeles Aqueduct, an irrigation channel that brought water to the thirsty city of L.A., was dynamited multiple times.It was against this backdrop that the St. Francis Dam fell. The dam, completed in 1926, was the brainchild of William Mulholland, general manager of the Bureau of Water Works and Supply in Los Angeles, leader of the Los Angeles Aqueduct project and namesake of Hollywood's Mulholland Drive. The reservoir held by the dam was intended to be an emergency water supply, in case the Los Angeles Aqueduct was damaged by an earthquake.During the construction of the dam, Mulholland ordered two increases in the dam's height by 20 feet (6 m), but didn't substantially widen its base, according to Water and Power Associates, a nonprofit educational organization. This additional height, combined with unstable geology around the dam, weakened the structure and made collapse all but certain, according to geologists. The dam took two years to fill and was always prone to some seepage. On March 12, 1928, new leaks appeared. Mulholland and some colleagues personally inspected the structure and declared it safe. Less than 12 hours later, it collapsed.No one who saw the collapse survived, but it must have happened rapidly and with great force: A motorcyclist passed by 7 minutes before the collapse and noticed nothing amiss. The largest surviving section of the crumpled concrete structure, which weighed 10,000 tons, was found three-quarters of a mile downstream, according to Water and Power Associates.Officially, about 450 people died in the disaster, though the real number may have been higher because the floodwaters rushed through areas where migrant workers were camped, according to the Los Angeles Times.Mulholland's career ended with the dam collapse. Though he was not criminally charged, he told the coroner's inquest, "Don’t blame anyone else, you just fasten it on me. If there was an error in human judgment, I was the human." California rapidly passed laws tightening dam safety and requiring the registration of civil engineers after the catastrophe.  Original article on Live Science.

Floodwaters that rose to rooftops were slowly receding Thursday as villages began digging out of the deluge of mud from the dam's failure late Monday.In a report issued Thursday, the state-run Vientiane Times said the Ministry of Energy and Mines had ordered closer monitoring of water levels in reservoirs and of conditions at dam sites.It said the thousands of people stranded on rooftops and in trees had been rescued by Wednesday. Lao Prime Minister Thongloun Sisoulith described the disaster as the worst in years in the impoverished country, with more than 6,000 people displaced after the auxiliary dam of a joint venture hydroelectric project gave way after days of torrential rains. Thongloun said authorities were investigating if the dam's collapse resulted from heavy rainfall or from inadequate construction standards. The South Korean company responsible for building the dam, SK Engineering & Construction, also said it was trying to determine why the dam failed. Villagers carry their belonging as they evacuate after the Xepian-Xe Nam Noy hydropower dam collapsed in Attapeu province, Laos, July 24, 2018. REUTERS The Red Cross, South Korean government and other organizations were rushing water purifiers, food and other aid to shelters crowded with hundreds of displaced families evacuated from a half-flooded no-man's-land of orange mud and debris. Initially Laos' state media reported that hundreds of people were missing and feared dead. Difficult communications and heavy rains, which have hampered rescue efforts, likely contributed to discrepancies in information about casualties.The exact circumstances of the dam's collapse remain murky, and local officials said they had formed a committee to "seek common ground on the responsibilities and obligations for the tragic disaster," the Vientiane Times reported.SK Engineering & Construction said the dam began failing Sunday, while Korea Western Power, another partner in the project, said the earth-fill dam began visibly weakening on Friday. Villagers take refuge on a rooftop above flood waters from a collapsed dam in the Attapeu district of southeastern Laos, July 24, 2018. AP SK Engineering sent its president and an emergency team to help with the rescue and repair effort. In a statement Thursday, it said it would help build lodging for those displaced. "We will find out causes of the incident thoroughly and take necessary actions quickly," it said in a statement earlier this week.The Thai partner in the dam project, the Ratchaburi Electricity Generating Holding Public Co., said the joint venture had sent experts to the area to investigate and analyze the situation and discuss with the authorities how to resolve the problem.Monsoon rains clearly contributed to the disaster: A report by the intergovernmental Mekong River Commission said storms had caused water levels along the river to rise by 9-15 feet in the past week.Continued heavy rain and strong winds forecast for the area could hinder recovery efforts, and risks from flooding persisted in the mountainous region.But a flurry of dam building along the Mekong River and its tributaries, including those affected by this disaster, has raised concerns over environmental impact and other problems.The 1.02 billion project encompassing several river basins in a remote corner of southeastern Laos is the first hydroelectric dam to be built by a South Korean company, and it was unclear how severe the damage would be to the overall plan. The dam was due to begin operating in 2019, with 90 percent of the power generated going to Thailand.Laos has dozens of hydroelectric projects under construction and plans for sales of power to neighboring countries, now accounting for about a third of its exports, to grow substantially. International Rivers, a non-governmental group generally critical of such projects, said the catastrophe showed the need to improve warning systems."With over 70 hydropower projects currently built, under construction and planned across Lao PDR - most of them owned and operated by private companies - authorities must immediately review how dams are being planned, designed and managed," the group said in a statement.

The main spillway is on the bottom and the emergency spillway is above. Photo: William Croyle/AP Roughly 188,000 people living downstream from Northern California’s Lake Oroville were ordered to immediately evacuate on Sunday afternoon after an emergency spillway releasing millions of gallons of water from the lake threatened to fail due to erosion. By late Sunday night, the situation had improved, but the evacuation order has yet to be lifted. The lake, which is about 150 miles northeast of San Francisco, is held back by the 770-foot-tall Oroville Dam, the tallest in the country. Record storms took Lake Oroville from 80 percent full to overflowing in less than a week, as the L.A. Times explains. While the dam itself is structurally sound, last week a hole caused by erosion was discovered on the main spillway. It spread across the concrete-lined channel, and on Saturday the emergency spillway was used for the first time since the dam was completed in 1968. Initially the system appeared to be working, but on Sunday engineers spotted a hole in the emergency spillway. At 4:20 p.m local time, an evacuation order was issued for everyone living downstream of Lake Oroville’s dam. Graphics #OrovilleDam #Oroville how water is flowing down emergency spillway.

We don’t know how much water that means, but we do know that’s potentially 30 feet of depth of Lake Oroville.” Residents of Butte, Sutter, and Yuba rushed out of the area, creating gridlock for miles. An evacuation shelter was set up in Chico, which is north of the lake, at the Silver Dollar fairgrounds. Belen Castaneda, 23, told the Times she was headed there with her family and an elderly neighbor who doesn’t speak English. “We just grabbed everything we could,” she said. “Everyone was freaking out.” Still 45 miles from Oroville.

Officials said they plan to use bags of rocks to plug the hole in the emergency spillway, but the situation is still precarious. Storms are forecast for later this week, and officials said they need to keep draining water from the lake for as long as possible. California governor Jerry Brown issued an emergency order on Sunday night. “I’ve been in close contact with emergency personnel managing the situation in Oroville throughout the weekend and it’s clear the circumstances are complex and rapidly changing,” Brown said in a statement. “The state is directing all necessary personnel and resources to deal with this very serious situation.” Eight California National Guard helicopters will assist with the attempt to reconstruct the emergency spillway. All 23,000 soldiers in the California National Guard have been notified that they should be ready to deploy if needed. According to the AP, the entire California National Guard hasn’t been put on alert since the 1992 L.A. riots.

But because its water levels are so high following heavy rain, the emergency spillway could unleash a wall of water onto communities and rivers below if it collapses.Sean Dennis was one thousands of residents trying to make the gridlocked journey to safer ground."We've never seen anything like this in modern times""We both were kind of shocked. Nothing like this has ever happened," said Dennis, 30, a chef from Yuba City, who recalled the moment he and his wife found out they had to leave. "We just grabbed what we could."Dennis spoke while driving his family to a hotel in Willows, a journey that had already taken five hours despite its being only 55 miles away.Cars quickly piled up at gas stations and on routes out of the evacuation zone after the order was given Sunday."What was usually a 20-minute drive took two hours," said Heather Sutton, 22, a Yuba Community College student. "It was bumper to bumper. ... You can almost see the panic happening."Sutton recalled telling her friend before they evacuated that "we need to grab photos, anything that has sentimental value." Everything else was left behind, she said.The sudden evacuation panicked residents, who scrambled to get their belongings into cars and then grew angry as they sat in bumper-to-bumper traffic hours after the order was given.Raj Gill, managing a Shell station where anxious motorists got gas and snacks, said his boss told him to close the station and flee himself. But he stayed open to feed a steady line of customers."You can't even move," he said. "I'm trying to get out of here, too. I'm worried about the flooding. I've seen the pictures — that's a lot of water."A Red Cross spokeswoman said more than 500 people showed up at an evacuation center in Chico.The shelter had run out of blankets and cots, and a tractor-trailer with 1,000 more cots was stuck in the gridlock of traffic Sunday night, Red Cross shelter manager Pam Deditch said.Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea, who ordered the evacuations, said Monday afternoon that he had no choice but to tell people to flee as quickly as possible."When this incident occurred, it became apparent that we needed to act quickly," he said. "I recognize and appreciate the frustration that people who have been evacuated must feel. That was not a decision I made lightly."Expected Dam Failure Prompts EvacuationsFeb. 13, 201700:41The order was issued suddenly Sunday after officials spotted the damage to the emergency spillway's concrete lip. The auxiliary spillway was being used for the first time in almost 50 years, according to The Associated Press, because the 770-foot-tall dam was full to the brim and its main spillway was damaged by heavy rain last week.It could also breach the network of levees along the way and cause problems as far away as Sacramento.Several state water and government officials told NBC News that 1 million acre-feet of water could be released, overwhelming the Feather River and flooding communities in Butte County, Yuba City and Marysville. Kevin Lawson, deputy chief of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, said at a news conference Sunday night that 188,000 people had been ordered to evacuate from those areas."We've never seen anything like this in modern times," a state water official told NBC News. "This is a worst-case scenario for any water management agency, a worst-case nightmare."Croyle, meanwhile, said he wasn't aware of a 2005 filing with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission that warned about a possible failure with the emergency spillway."We're not going to get into recommendations or concerns that were voiced in the past," he said.Three environmental groups — Friends of the River, the Sierra Club and the South Yuba River Citizens League — filed the document after determining that the dam didn't meet modern safety standards. Its emergency spillway needed to be armored with concrete, the groups said."What nearly happened last night was what I've been fearing," Ronald Stork, senior policy advocate at Friends of the River, told NBC News. "I thought it was the time to fix it years ago."A regional engineer with the federal agency didn't appear to think it needed fixing, however. In response to the filing, the engineer, John Onderdonk, said in a 2006 memo that it met federal guidelines."During a rare flood event, it is acceptable for emergency spillway to sustain significant damage," he wrote.A Dam in Crisis Raises Alarm in CaliforniaFeb. 11, 201712:54From Sunday night to Monday morning, the water level of Lake Oroville had decreased, allowing engineers to assess the damage, according to the AP. Officials were still releasing water through the main spillway ahead of this week's expected storm.By midday Monday, officials said, water flows into the lake stood at about 45,000 cubic feet per second, with outflows at 100,000 cubic feet per second.Sheriff Honea said earlier that the damage could result in a "catastrophic failure" of the emergency spillway."Although it brings some stability to the situation, there are still a lot of unknowns," he told reporters. "We have staff looking at the various areas that evacuations have been ordered in and making a determination as to what areas are clearly in danger and what areas may be less vulnerable."California Gov. Jerry Brown issued an emergency order Sunday night to bolster the state's response, and on Monday he said he'd filed an emergency request for relief with the federal government and discussed the events in Oroville with a recently confirmed member of Donald Trump's cabinet.Although Brown and other elected state officials have vowed to make California a bulwark of resistance in Donald Trump's America, the governor described the conversation as congenial. He refused to identify the cabinet member, however."No vulgar details," he said.By Monday night, a Federal Emergency Management Agency team of specialists was in Oroville and its regional office was helping the state prepare for the upcoming storms. In a statement, the agency said it had supplied 150,000 bottles of water, 20,000 blankets and 10,000 cots.Tim StellohTim Stelloh is a breaking news reporter for NBC News Digital.Andrew BlanksteinAndrew Blankstein is an investigative reporter for NBC News.

According to Reuters, officials say more than 50,000 people have had to flee. Authorities fear that thousands of people may still be trapped in their homes, Agence France-Presse reported. Rescuers are working "into the night to try to ferry residents out." "The (spillway) of the dam was broken and flooded the two villages close to the highway," the fire department said, according to Reuters.

According to the local news site Frontier Myanmar, the fire department said that in some areas, the floodwater is 3 feet deep. It added that rescue workers say the levels have receded somewhat, but they're concerned about the possibility of more rain. "If you go to my house, there are no belongings left," farmer Aung Aung told Reuters. His village, Kone Gyi Lan Sone, has flooded. Asia Huge Flood From Failed Dam In Laos Has Now Spread To Cambodia After fleeing to higher ground, he says he realized the extent of the damage. "The little shop over there is completely destroyed and washed away," he told the wire service. Officials are also surveying a major bridge that was damaged by the floodwaters. The concrete bridge appears to have cracked and is sagging in multiple places, above a fast-rushing river. The bridge connects two of the country's largest cities, according to AFP. A major bridge along the highway connecting Yangon to Mandalay has been damaged by rampaging floodwaters from a failed dam. Thet Aung/AFP/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Thet Aung/AFP/Getty Images Deputy Minister for Construction Kyaw Linn told AFP that he's concerned about how the flood may have affected the supporting towers of the bridge. "We will get divers to go down and check after the water levels recede," he said. It's not clear what, precisely, caused the dam to fail, though the area has been experiencing heavy rain. Reuters, citing state media, said local officials had inspected the dam a few days ago and said it was in good condition. "There is nothing to be concerned about," administrator Tun Nay Aung is quoted as saying. This isn't the first recent flood for the country. "The deluge comes just weeks after heavy monsoon rains pummelled Myanmar, causing widespread flash floods that forced some 150,000 people to flee their homes," AFP reported. Last month, flooding in nearby Laos also caused a dam to fail, killing at least 27 people, as NPR's Bill Chappell reported. That flooding later spread to Cambodia, forcing 25,000 more people to flee in an area more than 40 miles away from the dam.

Download PDF "If, many years before the May 2020 failure, the dams had become publicly owned or a public-private partnership had been established, sufficient funds would have been available to upgrade the spillway capacity to pass an extreme flood, and therefore the rise of the lake in May 2020 would have been limited and the failure would almost certainly have been prevented," the report says.

Edenville Dam failure 6.jpg The Edenville Dam failed on May 19, 2020. When the dam failed, the contents of Wixom Lake rushed down the Tittabawassee River through Midland and Saginaw counties. Floodwaters quickly overtopped the Sanford Dam and caused record flooding in Midland.The report officially names static liquefaction for causing soil on the east bank of the Edenville Dam to fail. That is a process where the soil becomes completely saturated with water and loses its strength. Dam Recovery New engineering report blames loss of soil strength for Edenville Dam disaster By ABC12 News Staff The report notes that the Edenville Dam was constructed with a higher concentration of loose sand around 1923 to 1925 -- nearly a century ago. The sand was more susceptible to static liquefaction and failure than other soil types."Edenville Dam was constructed in the 1920s in a manner which significantly deviated from the design plans and construction specifications, and this resulted in the embankments being constructed with sections of very loose to loose sands which created the fundamental physical condition required for static liquefaction," a summary of the report says.The report says parts of the dam -- including the east face that failed -- were constructed with downstream faces that were too steep. That placed additional stress on the structure when it was holding back a record amount of water.Government regulators performed structural analyses of the entire 6,000-foot face of the Edenville Dam several times over its 95-year history, but the report notes that the testing was not thorough enough to uncover the soil problems that caused the failure."If this vulnerability had been recognized, it could have been remediated by slope flattening or buttressing, which the dam owners would have been able to afford and which had already been done at other locations. This remediation would likely have prevented the embankment failure," the report says.Mid-Michigan saw significant rainfall over the weekend of May 16 and 17, 2020. That caused water to pile up rapidly in Wixom Lake behind the Edenville Dam, but the report says the rainfall amounts were "not extreme."Nearly 6 inches of rain was reported farther north at the Secord Dam on the Tittabawassee River and nearly 4 inches of rain fell at the Edenville Dam over May 16 and 17, 2020.However, engineers' report says the dam's operators only opened the spillway gates about 7 feet on May 18 and 19 due to concerns for their personal safety and structural integrity of the spillways.That meant water couldn't move through the dam as fast as it reached the structure. The report notes that the water level in Wixom Lake was 5.5 feet higher than normal and only 1.5 feet below the top of the dam when it failed. Dam Recovery Flash flood emergency: Edenville Dam has failed, Sanford Dam has breached By: Ryan Jeltema The dam was holding back a record amount of water and was placed under higher stress than it ever had seen before when it failed.About 10,000 people were evacuated when the dam broke. Thousands of homes and businesses sustained damage, which led to a total property loss of over 250 million.

(Matthew Hatcher/Getty Images)Placeholder while article actions loadIn the past decade, I’ve spent a lot of time working as a videographer in Greenland, a place where climate change was, at one time, perhaps more obvious than in temperate zones. In this pandemic year, however, there will be no fieldwork in the Arctic.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightAs it happened, climate change came to me.The dam catastrophe in Midland County, Mich., my home since birth, was a huge blow to the local economy and an emotional gut punch for those who live here. The very geography of our lives and memory has changed.Michigan dam disaster an example of what could happen in many other communitiesWalking through the battered, mud-covered main street of Sanford, Mich., flooded from a breached dam, and the dry moonscape that once was Wixom Lake, held back by the Edenville Dam, brought me a visceral sense of dread.The story that has been well covered in recent days is one of finger-pointing between the lake homeowners, the dam owner, and the city, county, state and federal authorities: to assign blame for the tragedy and the damage.AdvertisementBut a key underlying dynamic has gotten a lot less attention. According to the U.S. Global Change Research Program, heavy precipitation events, fueled by more moisture in a warming atmosphere, have increased almost 40 percent across the upper Midwest in recent decades.Like sea level rise, ice-sheet loss, ocean acidification, desertification and deforestation, the change has been, in human terms, gradual, and for those not paying attention, easy to ignore.Most of our infrastructure — the roads, dams, bridges, hospitals, airports, harbors, power plants, pipelines, businesses, storm sewers and homes — was built for a planet that no longer exists. Climate change is not something that will only take place in the future. The climate has already changed in large because of human actions, and the sooner we recognize this and adapt, the better.Satellite imagery reveals massive scope of Midland, Mich., flood disasterFor most of us, climate change won’t be like the giant tsunamis and superstorms from the movie “The Day After Tomorrow,” at least in the coming few decades. Instead, it will take the form of insidious, creeping, gradual changes that tend not to draw the media and public attention and that force politicians to deal with them. That is, until extreme events push our infrastructure past important thresholds.Storms come and go, but as long as the water stays a few inches below the levee, life goes on. Then, suddenly, with just an extra inch of rise, a barrier is overtopped, and life changes abruptly, and permanently.The heavy rain event of the past week was consistent with this pattern. In 2017, Midland and neighboring counties were declared disaster areas after June rains, and a number of neighborhoods flooded, bringing back memories of the Great Flood of 1986, which until this week was the record for the area. No doubt many homeowners assumed the 2017 event was a freak outlier, a black swan, unlikely to occur for another 30 years. But this week, even before the dams began to fail, those same neighborhoods were flooded again.AdvertisementAs the new normal dawns and is priced in, these homes, most in solidly middle-class or even upper-class areas, will lose enormous value.As that pattern repeats itself across the country, homeowners will find their wealth diminished. Middle-class neighborhoods will be hollowed out and tax bases eroded, as homes can no longer be repaired or even insured against further damage. Once-stable economies will begin to be undermined.Parts of Siberia are hotter than Washington, with temperatures nearly 40 degrees above averageThis might be a wake-up call for middle Americans who have assumed they were not vulnerable to climate change. Midwesterners are not subject to coastal storms or sea-level rise, nor are they in the path of giant wildfires like in Australia, Siberia or western North America. There are no Midwestern glaciers steadily and visibly wasting away.But across the heartland, flood-control infrastructure, and dams like those in Edenville and Sanford, number in the thousands, and many, if not most, are in disrepair.AdvertisementA changed climate has made each of them a strategically placed time bomb.Midland is a community with a strong economic base. We are resilient and will rebuild, I’m sure.

To date, the federal state of Minas Gerais had handed the district 160,000 euros - and 70% of the sludge had yet to be removed, he said.The seven claimants, including the parents, three brothers and husband of 30-year-old Vale engineer Izabela Barroso Cãmara Pinto, are demanding around half a million euros in damages from the company. One of her brothers said he was "sad and angry".Claimant lawyers say if this case succeeds, about 1,200 other people, who lost family members or were directly affected by the dam failure, could launch follow-on claims that could propel damages to billions of euros.The next hearing has been scheduled for February 2022.TÜV Sud, which no longer offers dam safety inspections, and its employees have also faced criminal investigations in Germany and Brazil.(1 = 0.8537 euros)(1 = 5.3349 reais)Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.comRegisterWriting and additional reporting by Kirstin Ridley; additional reporting by Clara Denina; editing by Barbara LewisOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.AmericasGalleryVenezuela moves to strengthen rule of law, judicial independence a concern: UN, article with galleryAmericas · June 29, 2022Venezuela has taken some steps to strengthen the rule of law but the lack of independence of its legal system remains concerning, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet said in a new report on Wednesday.MarketsAustralia's AGL Energy says rebuffed suitor Brookfield has bought small stake, article with image2:22 AM UTCAmericasArgentine trucker protest slashes grains delivery, threatening exports and milling, article with imageJune 29, 2022AmericasIMF says Haiti staff-monitored program may lead to loan deal, article with imageJune 29, 2022BusinessBrazil Volkswagen workers approve agreement for 193 mln investment, article with imageJune 29, 2022Site IndexBrowseWorldBusinessLegalMarketsBreakingviewsTechnologyInvestigationsLifestyleAbout ReutersAbout ReutersCareersReuters News AgencyBrand Attribution GuidelinesReuters LeadershipReuters Fact CheckReuters Diversity ReportStay InformedDownload the AppNewslettersInformation you can trustReuters, the news and media division of Thomson Reuters, is the world’s largest multimedia news provider, reaching billions of people worldwide every day.

Dam failure triggers huge blackout in Brazil - CNN.com <![endif]--> Share this on: Mixx Facebook Twitter Digg delicious reddit MySpace StumbleUpon LinkedIn Dam failure triggers huge blackout in Brazil STORY HIGHLIGHTS Minister: Itaipu dam shut down at about 10:30 p.m. Some power returns to Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo shortly after Neighboring Paraguay, Uruguay report related blackouts Hydroelectric dam provides over 20 percent of Brazil's energy RELATED TOPICS Brazil Rio de Janeiro Sao Paulo (CNN) -- An important hydroelectric dam shared by Brazil and Paraguay failed Tuesday night, pushing a large swath of central and southern Brazil into darkness, said the country's minister of mines and energy, Edison Lobao. At about 10:30 p.m. (7:30 p.m. ET), the Itaipu dam shut down completely, Lobao said in a radio interview. Power began to slowly return Tuesday night, and authorities expected a restoration of power overnight, Lobao said. An official at Brazil's National Electric System Operator told CNN that the incident at Itaipu caused an outage of 18,000 megawatts. The official declined to be named because he was not authorized to talk to the media. The outage was approximately equivalent to the amount of energy needed to power the state of Sao Paulo and its 20 million residents, the official said. "Everything's fine," the official said, adding that as Itaipu rebooted, it would repower the affected regions. Millions of people were affected by the blackout in six Brazilian states that included the cities of Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo. The capital, Brasilia, was unaffected, CNN en Español reported. Neighboring Paraguay and Uruguay also reported related blackouts, Lobao said. Rio's main streets and avenues were in a total blackout. Video footage showed long lines of cars at a near standstill on the roads, and the subway system in Rio came to a stop. Itaipu provides more than 20 percent of Brazil's energy.

Another inspection at 11 a.m. showed continued deterioration as a mud slide on the levee worsened, prompting the county to enact an emergency plan to prepare for the dam's "imminent" failure. Rain held off for the rest of the day, though, which had officials thankful as the situation seemed to briefly stabilize.At a 5 p.m. briefing, Oktibbeha County Emergency Management Agency Director Kristen Campanella said the area east of the dam would see severe damage by water should the structure fail. Oktibbeha County EMA Director Kristen Campanella, right, speaks during the 5 p.m. briefing on Tuesday as District 3 Supervisor Marvell Howard listens. (Photo by Ryan Phillips, SDN) She said the situation had somewhat evened out as rain held off later in the day Tuesday, but more rain was expected on Wednesday, with another significant rain event forecast over the weekend.Over the next 24 hours, the National Weather Service expects about half an inch of rain for Oktibbeha County, which Campanella said translates to four feet of water in the lake and more pressure on the strained levee.Campanella said emergency preparations have been made and crews from Mississippi State University and OCH Regional Medical Center are available to evacuate large numbers of people if mandatory evacuations become necessary.According to the county’s action plan for Oktibbeha County Lake, there are approximately 130 households or addresses in the area that could be impacted in the event of a dam failure. As of Tuesday night, Campanella said only one wheelchair-bound resident requested to be evacuated and was able to do so with assistance from Mississippi State University Parking and Transit Services.

While the shelter will not come out to pick pets up, they will accept drop-offs.The county storm shelter was opened temporarily on Tuesday as a staging area, but was closed after no one needed access to it, Campanella said.In the event of an increased threat of dam failure, Oktibbeha County will send out a CodeRED text message to those in a polygon for the impacted areas.“We will send it out if we see some seepage or that slide gets worse,” Campanella said, referring to the mudslide seen on the levee, where dirt is being eroded away by water from the lake.BREAKING: County officials are discussing plans for evacuation as the failure Oktibbeha County Lake Dam appears imminent pic.twitter.com/EvQ2b27Mru— Brad Robertson (@starkvillebrad) January 14, 2020Starkville-Oktibbeha Consolidated School District Assistant Superintendent David Baggett attended the briefing Tuesday night and said the district will reroute buses away from the levee portion of County Lake Road until the situation improves.The full road will remain open until further notice.FAMILIAR PROBLEMS The dam is located in District 3, and its county supervisor, Marvell Howard, has long called for repairs to be made to the structure.On Tuesday, he met with emergency officials and gave an update to those living in the area.“Everybody now is sort of on standby,” Howard said Tuesday night. “Everybody is aware of what needs to take place if we have to make that call [to evacuate] in the middle of the night.”UPDATE: at 2p check nothing had changed since 11a, which is a good sign, likely because of not getting any more rain. There is no warning siren in area. Emergency officials will come through with lights and sirens to warn of imminent threat if it occurs overnight pic.twitter.com/UIqpazN4ga— Ryan Phillips (@JournoRyan) January 14, 2020The problems facing the dam currently, Howard said, were in the same location where a repair was made years ago."This particular location was a location we repaired a couple of years ago in 2016, and it's failed," Howard said.The county engineer, Pritchard, also warned county officials in 2016 of safety concerns posed by slope deterioration, which was caused by the water level of the lake fluctuating. Slope work was done in 2017, but was viewed as falling short of addressing the full scope of needs for the Oktibbeha County Lake.As recent as last September, supervisors mulled grant options to fund a complete replacement of the aged levee, but the project has yet to come to fruition.Howard said on Tuesday that water from the lake had seeped between the dam and the ground beneath it, placing the integrity of the structure into question.The county has had long-reported problems with seepage at the dam, but with recent rain, the problems were quickly noticed.Howard did say the county brought in four 12-inch lines to help alleviate some of the pressure from the levee by pumping excess water into the county’s emergency spillway.County officials said they will continue monitoring the situation, and Howard said they will be looking for continued evidence of "sandy-brown water" that would suggest more of the ground beneath the dam had been washed out.A more immediate sign of failure would be a constant stream of water coming out from beneath the dam. Howard said this could signal a quick deterioration of the dam, possibly indicating a breach could occur in as little as 45 minutes.Evacuations of the area east of the levee and in the flood plain were strongly encouraged by county officials, as the water would be uncontrollable if the dam failed."If it actually breaches, we won't have much time at all," Howard said.Campanella said barricades and road signs were in place to block off closed roads if needed.Howard said roughly 250 people could be affected by the dam's failure, himself among them.“I would probably be the first house," Howard said. "I live within throwing distance of the levee right there.”Inspectors from the county and the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality continued monitoring the dam. Campanella said the results of those inspections would ultimately determine if mandatory evacuations were issued.Another inspection was scheduled for Wednesday morning at 7 a.m. unless overnight rainfall was reported.According to a two-year investigation conducted by the Associated Press, Mississippi has one of the highest number of dams in danger of failing, though the Oktibbeha County Lake dam was not listed in that investigation as being one of the state's most hazardous.

Dam fails in eastern Iowa, causing massive flooding - CNN.com <![endif]--> Share this on: Mixx Facebook Twitter Digg delicious reddit MySpace StumbleUpon LinkedIn Dam fails in eastern Iowa, causing massive floodingBy the CNN Wire Staff Dam breaks in Iowa, town evacuatedSTORY HIGHLIGHTSNEW: Floodwaters appear to be receding, governor's spokesman saysNEW: Much of the flooding occurred in rural farm areas Disaster declared in Delaware and Jones countiesThe breach was caused by "massive rain," officials say (CNN) -- A dam on an eastern Iowa lake suffered a "catastrophic" failure Saturday, sending a massive amount of water into nearby communities and forcing residents to flee, officials said. The Lake Delhi dam, about 45 miles north of Cedar Rapids, failed as a result of "massive rain -- a very unusually high amount this season," according to Jim Flansburg, communications director for Gov. Chet Culver. Culver told CNN that nearly 10 inches of rain had recently fallen in a 12-hour period in the area and was "too much water for the dam to hold." The roads on either side of the dam -- which were part of the cement dam's containment measures -- apparently gave out as a result of the rainfall, Flansburg told CNN. The National Weather Service reported a 30-foot-wide gap in the berm alongside the dam. Map: Dam failure forces evacuations RELATED TOPICS Floods Iowa National Weather Service Video showed massive amounts of water violently gushing from the pool behind the dam into the Maquoketa River below. Nearby homes and buildings were under water up to their eaves. However, as of Saturday evening, the waters appeared to be receding, Flansburg said. Much of the flooding occurred in farm areas instead of well-populated neighborhoods, Flansburg said, adding a would-be catastrophe was avoided. Earlier Saturday, residents in Hopkinton, a town of about 700, were given minutes to flee approaching floodwaters, Flansburg said. No injuries were reported. The town of Monticello, where Culver was meeting with emergency personnel, was also under a flood warning. Amanda Duck, a trained weather spotter along with her husband in Monticello, told CNN she had been watching the water slowly rise all day. By evening, water was beginning to seep over a road that runs behind her house and into her neighbor's yard, she said. "We're both just in a state of shock," Duck said. "We're just trying to keep our wits about us and help our neighbors." Culver activated the National Guard in the area to help with recovery efforts, his office said. He also issued disaster proclamations for Delaware and Jones counties due to the flooding. Culver credited the lack of injuries to local officials providing early warning to residents in the flood plain about the possibility of a dam breach. The governor said such a failure had never happened before.

About 300 people have been deployed to search the area using boats and divers. At least seven of those missing after the initial disaster have already been found, RT reported.

More than 6,000 people lost their homes when the dam gave way on Monday, flooding surrounding villages.The exact number of victims was unclear. The official Lao news agency KPL said Tuesday afternoon that hundreds of people were missing, without providing details. More recent reports put the number missing in the dozens. KPL said Wednesday that the death toll had risen to 19.Photos and videos posted on social media showed people sitting on rooftops to escape the surging water, while others were carried to safety or rescued by boat. State media said helicopters were also being used to rescue people. SK Engineering & Construction, one of two South Korean partners in the project, said the top of one of five auxiliary earth-fill dams at the project "got swept away" on Sunday night after heavy rains.But Korea Western Power, which was due to operate the hydroelectric power plant after its completion, said problems first emerged Friday when workers discovered the dam's center had sunk by 4.3 inches. Villagers take refuge on a rooftop above flood waters from a collapsed dam in the Attapeu district of southeastern Laos, July 24, 2018. AP Repair work for the earth-fill dam was hampered by heavy rain and damaged roads, and the situation worsened on Monday as water cascaded out of the reservoir, flooding seven out of 12 villages in the area, SK E&C said. It was helping to evacuate and rescue residents while also trying to contain further damage. The government declared the area a disaster zone and top officials rushed to the site, it said.Continued heavy rain and strong winds forecast for the area could hinder rescue efforts, and risks from flooding persisted in the mountainous region.Provincial authorities issued a call for emergency aid -- clothing, food, drinking water, medicine, cash and other items -- from the "party, government organizations, business community, officials, police and military forces and people of all strata."The International Red Cross said food was a concern because village food supplies were drenched in the flooding. It was arranging for water purification units to be sent to the area to ensure supplies of clean drinking water. The presidential office in South Korea said President Moon Jae-in had ordered an emergency relief team to help with the disaster.SK E&C sent its president to Laos and set up an emergency team in Seoul, South Korea's Yonhap News agency reported.The 1.02 billion project encompassing several river basins in a remote corner of southeastern Laos is the first hydroelectric dam to be built by a South Korean company, and it was unclear how severe the damage would be to the overall plan. The dam was due to begin operating in 2019, with 90 percent of the power generated going to Thailand.Shares of companies affiliated with SK E&C sank on Wednesday on concerns over potential costs for compensation and other financial setbacks from the disaster.SK Discovery Co., SK E&C's second-largest shareholder with a 28.25 stake in the builder, tumbled more than 10 percent to trade at its lowest level in more than three years. SK Holdings Co., the biggest shareholder in SK E&C with a 44.48 percent stake, fell 3 percent.Laos has dozens of hydroelectric projects under construction and plans for sales of power to neighboring countries, now accounting for about a third of its exports, to grow substantially.But dam building along the Mekong River and its tributaries, including those affected by this disaster, has raised concerns over environmental impact and other problems. International Rivers, a nongovernmental group generally critical of such projects, said the catastrophe showed the need to improve warning systems."With over 70 hydropower projects currently built, under construction and planned across Lao PDR - most of them owned and operated by private companies - authorities must immediately review how dams are being planned, designed and managed," the group said in a statement.

The dam, which is the nation’s tallest, remains intact. But the emergency spillway, which guards against the overflow of the dam when water levels are high, was eroding Sunday. The damage prompted a mandatory evacuation for cities and counties near Lake Oroville. In the worst case scenario, one official said, an uncontrolled release from the dam could send a 30-foot wall of water downstream. “I’m not going to lift the evacuation order until I have a better idea of what that means and what risk that poses,” Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea said in a news conference late Sunday night. Officials are waiting until daylight Monday to better assess the situation and decide when it’s safe for residents to return, Honea said. California Gov. Jerry Brown issued a state emergency order to help local authorities with the situation and evacuations. What led up to the emergency Heavy rainfall in Northern California this winter has filled Lake Oroville to the verge of overflow. The lake also gets water from the northern Sierra Nevada mountain range, which is experiencing one of its wettest seasons. This has triggered concerns over whether the water could overflow the dam and flood nearby communities. The Oroville Dam provides flood control for the region and is located about 75 miles north of Sacramento. The lake has returned to near its pre-drought levels. Getty Images The dam has two spillways – the primary and the emergency spillway – which are channels to leak water out of the lake to prevent overflow. And right now, both have problems. 6:08pm: #OrovilleDam itself is not compromised at current time. Failure would be on auxiliary spillway. See graphic for details. pic.twitter.com/LSxCwsthxC— NWS Sacramento (@NWSSacramento) February 13, 2017 Last week, the primary spillway was damaged by erosion, according to the California Department of Water Resources. Images of the structure showed a massive hole in the lower part of the channel. spillway at the #orovilledam - erosion was 1st reported 3 days ago, since then it has grown. pic.twitter.com/MNep5CQ9Ni— CANGJOCOPS (@CANGJ3OPS) February 9, 2017 That hole can’t be fixed at the moment. It’s 250 feet long, 170 feet wide and about 40 to 50 feet deep, said Bill Croyle, acting director of the Department of Water Resources. “You don’t throw a little bit of rock in it,” he said. Of the two, the emergency spillway is a last resort. At Oroville Dam, the emergency spillway is only used if water levels reach 901 feet in elevation. It hasn’t needed to be used in its 48-year history – until this weekend. Why evacuation order was made A light flow of water began washing into the emergency spillway Saturday and the volume of water began to increase. Around 3 p.m. (6 p.m. ET) Sunday, authorities learned that the dam’s emergency spillway was also eroding, Honea said. The erosion of the emergency spillway is dangerous because “when you start to erode the ground, the dirt and everything else starts to roll off the hill,” said Kevin Lawson, California Fire incident commander. “It starts to undermine itself. If that is not addressed, if that’s not mitigated properly, essentially what we’re looking at, is approximately a 30-foot wall of water,” he said. Evacuation orders on Sunday sternly warned residents that the erosion could result in “large, uncontrolled releases of water from Lake Oroville.” This is an evacuation order. Immediate evacuation from the low levels of Oroville and areas downstream is ordered. ...Posted by Butte County Sheriff on Sunday, February 12, 2017 Honea’s office used the most urgent of language – “This is NOT a drill” – in ordering residents to evacuate ahead of an impending disaster. Residents were told that the emergency “spillway is close to failing.” The evacuation order included “all Yuba County on the valley floor” and the city of Marysville, authorities said. ALERT-ALERT-ALERT -- Yes, an evacuation has been ordered. All Yuba County on the valley floor. The auxiliary spillway is...Posted by Yuba County Office of Emergency Services on Sunday, February 12, 2017 About 35,000 people from Butte County, 65,000 from Yuba County, 76,000 from Yuba City and 12,000 from Marysville City evacuated, according to California Fire. Stores closed. Shelters opened. Local gas stations were swarmed with cars as residents tried to leave town. Evacuees waited in traffic trying to get out of low-lying areas. Sean Dennis, who lives 30 miles south of Oroville, spoke to CNN from his car after spending 4.5 hours in bumper-to-bumper traffic. “It was pretty scary, just because of how fast everything was developing,” he said. “Me and my wife managed to throw as much of stuff as we could into garbage bags, whatever we could find. We got both of our cars loaded down pretty well. We’re not taking any chances.” Police said that despite rumors, there were no reports of looting. Watching the damage After issuing the evacuation orders, authorities noted significant decreases in the water coming over the emergency spillway. The flow of water on the emergency spillway eventually stopped Sunday night as the Department of Water Resources withdrew more water from the other spillway. The main spillway is releasing water at 100,000 cubic feet per second in an effort to reduce the amount of water traveling down the emergency spillway, authorities said. Normal flows down the main spillway are about 55,000 cubic feet per second. “The goal is to get the lake to drop 50 feet. If we can continue to do that, that brings a little bit of calm to what we’re trying to accomplish here,” said Cal Fire’s Lawson. So far, there have been no repairs made on the emergency spillway, because teams have been unable to reach the damaged area. Teams will take a look and assess the situation Monday morning, Croyle said. Authorities will have to act fast – more rain is in the forecast for Wednesday.

Partners Macquarie University provides funding as a member of The Conversation AU. View all partners Recovery efforts are underway in Bentos Rodrigues district in Brazil’s Minas Gerais state. Reuters/Ricardo Moraes Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger Two of the world’s largest miners, Australia’s BHP and Brazil’s Vale have been rocked by last Friday’s dam burst at the jointly-owned Samarco iron ore mine in Brazil, as efforts to recover the bodies of 28 missing people continue and estimated costs climb. BHP Billiton has announced its iron ore production guidance for the 2016 financial year is now under review, while the dual-listed miner’s Australian share price dropped 8% on news of the accident, contributing to ongoing share price pressure on the group. Management of dam failure risks from these two companies should be world’s best and all eyes will be on what Vale and BHP do next. Recovery teams are searching for 28 people missing after mine waste swept through the Bento Rodrigues district in Minas Gerais state, following the cascade failure of two dams, Fundão and Santarém. A third dam, Germarno, is being monitored. More than 60 million cubic metres of red muddy iron ore tailings have flooded downstream for almost 80 kilometres of the Rio Doce. The impact on other communities nestled downstream will also be significant. What led to the disaster? Although the causes of failure are yet to be established, Santarém is the first dam in Brazil to have the latest inflatable rubber top technology installed and approved by engineers and safety officers to allow storage of additional volume of tailings. Management will now be examining the technology to see if it had an impact on the cause and scale of the disaster; whether the location of waste storage piles close to the dams were involved; and the adequacy of warning systems in place for local communities. The risk from cascade dam failures is not new. Large mining tailings systems are often designed in sequence and so the chance of multiple failures is increased. Cumulative dam failures have caused disasters around the world often in unregulated agricultural settings. Perhaps the worst was in 1975 when 230,000 Chinese died after the Shimantan and Banquia dams burst, triggered by the failure of 60 upstream farm dams. In 1989 in the United States, the Evans and Lockwood dams both collapsed in a cascade manner, killing two people; Bulgaria in 2012 experienced cumulative failure of farm dams resulting in nine deaths. Five years ago in Brazil a cumulative series of private dams burst leaving 50 people dead and warnings of another 200 dams reported to be at high risk of cumulative failure. Now we have deaths from the Fundão and Santarém disaster in Brazil to add to the list. Balance between transparency and security So far, there has been a marked difference in the way the two companies have reacted to the disaster. BHP has moved quickly into damage control, with chief executive Andrew Mackenzie expressing sympathy for the workers and communities and making a site visit. Samarco mine management has placed an “Announcement to Society” on its website outlining its commitment to transparency and emergency plans under way. In contrast, Vale, placed a small notice on its website recognising the quick initiation of the emergency plan and confirming that it would work with Samarco. The joint venture partners will now need to weigh the issues of transparency for affected workers and community against its desire to secure the dam failure sites and assess the insurable risks. There is a real risk to reputation here. It is to be expected that Samarco, with BHP Billiton and Vale will want to seal off the sites and gather evidence for its own purposes, and restrict access to insurers, local authorities, and regulators, who have their own procedures to consider. But they also face a fine balance between being seen to cover up a larger disaster and being transparent about what happened. Effective management in these circumstances is essential; perceived mismanagement is a real possibility. One only has to look at the consequences for BP in dealing with the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill to understand the flow-on consequences of disaster mismanagement. In the background, BHP and Vale will have to consider the direct costs of rescheduling iron ore production and shipping which may not recommence for another three years with cleanup costs of 1.4 billion based on preliminary analysis, the impact on its share price, the additional costs of regulation to avoid repeat disasters, educating workers and communities, and possible upgrading of real time information flows about production, waste and seismic activities. In addition there is likely to be an industry effect whereby the credibility of mining is reduced and costs of capital reassessed, in line with increased insurance premiums. Loss of trust But perhaps one of the biggest risks is the loss of trust by workers and communities: this is something that requires an ethical and empathetic approach that reflects concern for vulnerable people and the environment - beyond profit and risk management. The question is whether multinational managers are capable of such leadership in times of disaster and can they translate this concern into business as usual. The future of the mining industry depends on such a shift in thinking. BHP Billiton Vale Samarco mine Want to write?

Judge allows 25 lawsuits against state of Michigan over 2020 dam failure to proceedNews Sports Autos Business Michigan Life + Home Entertainment Opinion Obituaries MICHIGANJudge allows 25 lawsuits against state over May 2020 dam failure to proceed Beth LeBlancThe Detroit NewsView Comments A judge will allow 25 lawsuits to proceed against the state of Michigan over the 2020 failure of the Edenville Dam and subsequent flooding in Midland and Gladwin counties. Court of Claims Judge Cynthia Stephens on Friday denied a motion to dismiss the claims against the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy and the Michigan Department of Natural Resources. Stephens’ order allows hundreds of Midland-area residents to continue arguing in court that the state’s actions in the lead-up to the May 19, 2020 dam failure constituted an unconstitutional taking, also called inverse condemnation. Stephens did dismiss claims alleging the state's actions amounted to trespassing.Ven Johnson, a lawyer for about 300 people affected by the flood, celebrated the decision Friday and urged the state not to waste time on an appeal. “This is a significant step forward in compensating these nearly 10,000 flood victims,” Johnson said. “We believe Judge Stephens’ opinion is 100 percent correct, and in the event that it is appealed, it will be upheld.”Attorney General Dana Nessel’s office on Friday said it was reviewing the ruling before it decides on future actions. “The plaintiffs' allegations in many instances are not accurate because they are based on incorrect information about the state agencies’ roles and actions,” said Lynsey Mukomel, a spokeswoman for Nessel’s office. The May 2020 Edenville Dam failure sent water rushing over and around the Sanford Dam and flooded area neighborhoods and businesses, causing about 10,000 people to evacuate. Government documents revealed the dam owners, Boyce Hydro, failed to comply with state and federal guidance for years. Documents also showed a fumbled hand off of oversight of the Edenville Dam between federal and state regulators in 2018 and an underfunded state dam safety effort ill-equipped to hold the dam owner to task.Residents had argued in their lawsuits that the state not only failed to push dam owner Boyce Hydro to improve its spillway capacity, but that the state also pressured Boyce to raise lake levels during the winter out of concern for a native mussel.Additionally, the state granted Boyce a permit to raise water levels weeks ahead of the flood, despite knowing of the dam's inadequate spillway capacity. The state has maintained that Boyce avoided complying with higher winter lake levels, not out of any safety concern, but because it would cost more to properly maintain the dams at those levels during the winter. Furthermore, the state has argued the denial of November drawdown permits had no bearing on the spring permit for summer levels. The dam company would have raised levels ahead of the summer months by court order with or without pressure from the state.Citing a July Michigan Supreme Court opinion in the Flint Water Case, Stevens noted that the residents’ allegations, if true, met the benchmarks for an inverse condemnation claim, including the requirement to show "affirmative action" on behalf of the state that led to the harm.  Specifically, Stevens drew parallels between the argument that the state took “affirmative action” to keep water levels high, despite knowing of the dam’s inadequate spillway capacity, and the argument in the Flint water case alleging the state took affirmative action to switch the city's water source to the Flint River despite knowing the risks associated with that water source.“Stated otherwise, plaintiffs allege that defendant was aware of the danger, disregarded it, and took affirmative actions that exacerbated the risk of flooding and ultimately led to the flooding of plaintiffs’ properties. These allegations set forth affirmative actions directed at plaintiffs’ properties,” Stephens wrote.There is no governmental immunity for constitutional claims such as inverse condemnation claims. The flooding left many residents with thousands of dollars in damages and many lacked the flood insurance necessary to cover the costs.Repairs to the damaged Midland-area dams — Secord, Smallwood, Edenville and Sanford — will cost residents about 215 million in assessments over 40 years. Some restoration work won't be complete until 2026. The state Legislature announced a plan this week to introduce new bills that would dedicate about 500 million in new funding toward dam repairs and emergency response, including funding specific to the restoration of the four Midland-area dams.Become a subscriber and gain full access to Detroit News content Already subscribed?

BHP faces first step in 6.3 billion UK claim over Brazil dam failure | ReutersDiscover Thomson ReutersDirectory of sitesLoginContactSupportfor-phone-onlyfor-tablet-portrait-upfor-tablet-landscape-upfor-desktop-upfor-wide-desktop-upCommodities NewsUpdated BHP faces first step in 6.3 billion UK claim over Brazil dam failureBy Kirstin Ridley2 Min ReadLONDON (Reuters) - More than 200,000 Brazilian people and groups will next week kick off a 5 billion-pound (6.3 billion) lawsuit against Anglo-Australian miner BHP in Britain over a 2015 dam failure that led to Brazil’s worst environmental disaster.The group claim, one of the largest in British legal history, has been brought on behalf of Brazilian individuals, businesses, churches, organisations, municipalities and indigenous people and will open in Manchester on July 22.An initial, eight-day hearing will establish whether the case can be heard in Britain, although the judge is expected to reserve judgment until later in the year. If successful, further trials are expected to determine liability and quantify damages.BHP spokesman Neil Burrows said the claim did not belong in Britain because it duplicated proceedings in Brazil and the ongoing work of the Renova Foundation, an entity created by the miner and its partners to manage reparations and repairs.The collapse of the Fundao tailings dam, which stored mining waste and is owned by the Samarco joint venture between BHP and Brazilian iron ore mining company Vale, killed 19 and spilled roughly 40 million cubic metres of toxic sludge into communities, the Rio Doce river and Atlantic Ocean 650 km away.Claimants allege BHP, the world’s largest miner by market value, ignored safety warnings as the dam’s capacity was repeatedly increased by raising its height - and disregarded cracks that pointed to early signs of rupture.“The public companies at the top of the BHP group structure, which we firmly believe bear ultimate responsibility for the disaster, have until now been insulated from its consequences within the Brazilian legal system,” said Tom Goodhead, a partner at law firm PGMBM, which represents the claimants.Goodhead said Brazilian environmental law had a long reach and imposed strict liability for environmental damage.Reporting by Kirstin Ridley in London; Additional reporting by Zandi Shabalala in London; Editing by Matthew LewisOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.AppsNewslettersAdvertise with UsAdvertising GuidelinesCookiesTerms of UsePrivacyDo Not Sell My Personal InformationAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

California Dam: Latest updates on the potential Lake Oroville dam failureMenuCalifornia Dam: Latest updates on the potential Lake Oroville dam failure ImpactByBrianna Provenzano2.14.2017As storms threatened to roll into Northern California this week, state officials raced to remove at least 50 feet of water from the overflowing Lake Oroville in the hopes of preventing disastrous flooding that would occur if the lake's dam were to burst.Tens of thousands of people received orders to evacuate homes located downstream from Lake Oroville on Sunday after it was discovered that the lake's emergency spillway had sustained damage from erosion and was in danger of bursting.According to the Los Angeles Times, water resource officials set to work on skimming water out of the brimming lake on Monday in an effort to prevent a "30-foot wall" of water from surging into nearby towns. "I've been doing these flood battles since 1978," state Sen. Jim Nielsen told the Los Angeles Times. "This is the one with the greatest potential for damage of all the ones I've dealt with."Bad weather warningsAs workers rush to make the fixes, inclement weather looms, said Tom Dang, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Sacramento."Obviously any rain this week is not helpful at all," he said.CNN Senior Meteorologist Dave Hennen forecasted rain beginning on Wednesday, with storms sticking around for the weekend.The heavy rains threaten to total between 5 and 12 inches, which could quickly reverse the efforts of officials hurrying to remove water from the lake.Displaced familiesThe Lake Oroville Dam, the tallest in the U.S., is responsible for preventing flooding in Butte, Sutter and Yuba counties — all of which received mandatory evacuation orders on Sunday, CNN reports.Families forced to flee have taken up temporary residence in shelters, tents and parking lots, and many are eager to get back to the homes they left behind."It was miserable," Pat Dailey told CNN affiliate KGO of sleeping in her car with her husband and four dogs the previous night. "We didn't sleep. There was people walking and people talking all night long."But while the repairs to the dam are ongoing, California Gov. Jerry Brown has continued to urge residents to stay away from their homes in the flood zone."We're doing everything we can to get this dam in shape so (evacuees]) can return and live safely without fear," he said at a press conference on Monday.CultureR.

interim report  Investigation of Failures at Edenville and Sanford Dams.The dam failures contributed to a 500-year flood event in Gladwin and Midland counties that forced the evacuation of more than 10,000 people from their homes. The flooding caused tens of millions of dollars of damage to homes, businesses and local infrastructure.The interim report blames the Edenville Dam’s catastrophic collapse on a phenomenon called “static liquefaction instability.” This failure mechanism has been rare, but not unprecedented, for water storage dams, and water storage dam engineers have not typically considered it. It has generally been assumed by geotechnical engineers that, under loading conditions other than earthquakes, water will be able to flow in and out of sands and their strength will be defined by the drained shear strength, regardless of the density of the sand – i.e., there will be no dramatic strength reduction as occurs in static liquefaction. The conclusion regarding static liquefaction at Edenville Dam is supported by:(a) the accelerations and velocities of the failing soil mass evident in the dam failure video(b) strong evidence of loose, uniform fine sand in the embankment  (c) strength loss behavior exhibited in laboratory tests on loose specimens of uniform sand collected from the breach remnant(d) a reasonably close match of a simplified kinetic analysis with the characteristics of the failure shown in the dam failure video.The report concludes the saturated, loose sand in a section of the dam’s embankment gave way and that led flood waters to over top the Sanford Dam downstream.A future report will address the human factors that led to the dam failures.Hugh McDiarmid Jr. is the spokesman for the Michigan Department of Energy, Great Lakes and Environment.  “We are waiting for the full report,” says McDiarmid Jr. “But...we will be reviewing the findings to see how we might apply them to Michigan to make the state’s dam safety program stronger.” Tags News midland floodingedenville damsanford damAssociation of State Dam Safety Officialsmidland flood Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Email Steve Carmody Steve Carmody has been a reporter for Michigan Radio since 2005.

REUTERS/Ricardo Moraes/File PhotoThe claim, which will be largest group action to be heard in England, was served on the miner on Tuesday on behalf of 235,000 Brazilian individuals and organizations, including municipal governments, utility companies, indigenous tribes and the Catholic Church, according to law firm SPG Law.BHP spokesman Neil Burrows said the miner intended to defend itself against the proceedings, brought in the north western English city of Liverpool.The collapse of the Fundao tailings dam, which stored mining waste and is owned by the Samarco joint venture between BHP and Brazilian iron ore mining giant Vale, killed 19 and spilled about 40 million cubic meters of toxic sludge into communities, the Rio Doce river and Atlantic Ocean 650 km away.Claimants allege BHP, the world’s largest mining company by market value, was aware of rising safety concerns, failed to act on repeated warnings from independent safety experts, increased industrial output of iron ore despite safety concerns and placed the pursuit of profit over human and environmental risk.“Driven by concern for declining revenues amidst the falling market price of iron ore, the company took risks, increased production and turned a blind eye to dangers that ultimately claimed lives and destroyed communities,” said Tom Goodhead, a partner at SPG Law, which is representing claimants.“BHP was woefully negligent in its duty of care and the damages sought are entirely commensurate with the devastation the company has wrought...,” he added.Brazil charged 22 people in 2016 with offences, including murder, over the Fundao dam’s collapse. The miners last year settled a 20 billion reais (5 billion) civil claim with local authorities to establish a clean-up fund. Other public cases, such as a 40 billion civil reparation case, are suspended.BHP, which has separately settled a U.S. investor class action and continues to battle Australian shareholder lawsuits, has rejected all charges against the company, as well as current and former staff.Although the disaster ranks as Brazil’s worst environmental catastrophe, the collapse of a Vale-operated tailings dam in the town of Brumadinho in January left a higher death toll, currently estimated at 300 people.Editing by Mark PotterOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.AppsNewslettersAdvertise with UsAdvertising GuidelinesCookiesTerms of UsePrivacyDo Not Sell My Personal InformationAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

California Department of Water Resources As large amounts of rain and snow soaked California last week, all eyes turned toward the threat of a dam failure at Lake Oroville, a reservoir that supplies much of the state’s drinking water. But what’s getting less attention is the fact that despite the easing of drought conditions in California, the situation below ground is still dry. Thus far, approximately 188,000 people who live near Lake Oroville remain under evacuation orders put in place when the lake’s water levels began to rise, reports the Sacramento Bee. The earthen dam, which holds 3.5 million acre-feet of water, is the tallest in the United States. But when heavy storms hit the Sierra Nevadas, the reservoir filled to its highest level ever. Such excess forced officials to use an emergency spillway that has started to erode, creating the possibility of a collapse. The Sierra Nevadas aren’t the only place in California hit with ample precipitation this winter. Earlier this year, a series of severe storms struck Southern California, driven by a temperature anomaly in the Pacific Ocean that shifted the jet stream from its usual position. Although that’s good news for the drought-parched state, it doesn’t mean that the drought is over. Drought conditions continue to prevail throughout much of the state. According to the United States Drought Monitor, which tracks drought conditions throughout the country, a large portion of central and southern California is still in the midst of a drought. Though much of the state’s dry segment is at a “moderate” drought level, pockets of “severe” and “extreme” drought remain despite extensive snowfall that has put statewide snowpack at 176 percent of normal. The water below the surface, known as groundwater, also remains in crisis. According to Thomas Harter, a groundwater expert and Robert M. Hagan Endowed Chair for Water Resources Management and Policy at the University of California, Davis, this deep water offers a kind of liquid insurance for the state. “Our groundwater is an endowment of nature,” Harter tells Smithsonian.com. Since the 1920s, water has been pumped up from beneath the surface to supplement snowpack and surface reservoirs. But during dry years, more water is pumped out of the ground than is put back in by precipitation—and the recent drought has overdrawn the groundwater account. “We have a large deficit,” explains Harter. “It will take up to six average to wet years to make up for the losses we’ve incurred over the last 15 years of groundwater storage.” Even if it rained constantly this year, says Harter, it wouldn’t make up for the loss, especially since groundwater takes longer to accumulate underground than it does to build up in above-ground reservoirs like Lake Oroville. In the meantime, some areas of the Central Valley are experiencing a phenomenon known as subsidence, in which rock settles in on itself and becomes more compact due to excessive groundwater pumping. Last year, scientists at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory found that some parts of central and southern California have sunk as much as 6.5 inches from subsidence. California is working on preventing such overpumping; in 2014, the state enacted a law that regulates the practice. But it will take plenty of precipitation to bring aquifers to the right levels—and ongoing depletion can contribute to decreases in water quality, habitat loss and even a higher risk of earthquakes. It all goes to show that the drought above is only part of the story—and California’s water crisis is far from over.

Big dam failures unlikely in Central PANews Sports GameTimePA FlipSidePA Opinion Obituaries E-Edition Legals Big dam failures unlikely in Central PABrandie Kesslerbkessler@ydr.comView CommentsView CommentsAbout a quarter of dams in Pennsylvania whose failure could put people's lives at risk are in poor or unsatisfactory condition, according to the Association of State Dam Safety Officials.While there is a lot of dam safety information available online, finding out the condition of such a dam near you isn't something you can get with a Google search.In Pennsylvania, information about dams with high hazard potential -- ones that will probably cause a loss of human life and significant property damage if they fail -- isn’t readily available. That includes the dams' names, locations and current conditions.What's the status of Indian Rock Dam?The state said the primary reason for that is because of the threat of a possible terrorist attack.Anyone who wants to know if the dam near where they live is a high-hazard-potential dam can find that out, but they’ll need to travel to Harrisburg to do so.“The information can be obtained by doing an informal file review at the Division of Dam Safety office in Harrisburg,” John Repetz, a spokesman for DEP’s Southcentral Regional office, said by email. “This would provide interested persons with all the pertinent information about any specific dam.”Even if a Pennsylvania dam were to fail, the result wouldn't be on par with what could have happened at the Oroville Dam in California, according to Roger Adams, chief of the division of dam safety for the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection. There are dams with similar issues to Oroville, but they, and their bodies of water, are much smaller than in Oroville.Photos: Holtwood dam whitewater park on the Susquehanna riverRaystown Lake in Huntingdon County is the largest lake wholly in Pennsylvania, said Roger Adams, chief of the division of dam safety for the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection. The dam at Raystown Lake is 200 feet tall, Adams said, while the dam at Lake Oroville is 770 feet tall.“So our largest lake is controlled by a dam a little less than a third (the size) of the one at Lake Oroville,” Adams said. He noted that Raystown Lake is about half the size of Lake Oroville.Dam risks in Adams, Franklin, Lebanon and York countiesAlthough the state doesn’t provide information about which dams are high-hazard-potential dams online or in a database, some counties in Pennsylvania do provide details about such dams that are within their boundaries.York County, in its 2013 Hazard Mitigation Plan, identified 12 high-hazard-potential dams in or around the county that would affect county residents if they failed. Information about those dams, including their locations and flood sources, were provided in the plan. The plan indicated there had been no dam failure in the county to that point, and “According to DEP, there are currently no unsafe dams in the County.”Similar plans were available from Adams and Lebanon counties.The Adams County 2014 All-Hazard Mitigation Plan Update did not name each individual dam, but indicated there were seven high-hazard-potential dams in or around the county that would affect county residents if they failed, and provided the dam locations on a map. The plan said there have been no known dam failures in Adams County and "provided that adequate engineering and maintenance measures are in place, high hazard dam failures are unlikely in Adams County."Pa. to release findings on fracking, quakesThe Lebanon County 2013 Hazard Mitigation Plan named five high-hazard-potential dams in the county, as well as their associated rivers, owners, and whether an emergency action plan had been completed for the dam. The plan indicated there had been two dam failures in Lebanon County in the past, both on June 22, 1972 as a result of flooding from Hurricane Agnes. The plan also noted "The probability of a significant dam failure in Lebanon County is unlikely to occur."Franklin County didn’t have information about dams available online. John K. Thierwechter, director of the county’s department of emergency services, provided some information via email. The Roxbury Dam, in Lurgan Township, is the only high-hazard potential dam in the county, but the county is in the inundation area -- the area that would be flooded if a dam failed -- of three dams classified as high-hazard-potential dams, Thierwechter said. He noted that all four dams have current emergency action plans and, he said, “there are no known issues with any of the dams.”Dam safety across PennsylvaniaAdams, with DEP’s division of dam safety, said dams throughout the country became much safer after the 1970s when new regulations were put in place.Dams can be owned by a federal agency, a state agency or a private person.One requirement for high-hazard-potential dam owners in Pennsylvania is that they notify people in and along the inundation area of their dam. An inundation map is created as part of the emergency action plans for these dams. Dam owners need to have the plans reviewed and possibly revised every few years, and then submit them to DEP. Dam owners are required to post notices in public locations that are in the inundation area, like at the municipal building and the local grocery store, Adams said.Want to swim in York's Lake Redman?Even though it was a rule that dam owners post the notices before 2008, DEP found that they didn’t always do it. So, Adams said, DEP made a rule that dam owners had to report where they posted the notices so DEP could check up on them.The last dam failure in Pennsylvania that resulted in death was in Johnstown in 1977, Adams said. He said six nearby dams failed and flooded the area.In 1979, emergency action plans were established, and the number of dam safety staff increased, Adams said.High-hazard-potential dams in Adams, Franklin, Lebanon and York countiesAdams CountyLong Pine Run, Lake Heritage Dam, Lake Meade Dam, and four other dams not named in the county’s 2014 all-hazard mitigation plan update.Franklin CountyRoxbury Dam, and three others, the names of which were not provided, that are outside the county but would affect county residents if they failed.Lebanon CountyMarquette Lake, Cornwall Tailings, Ebenezer Dam, Stoevers, Memorial LakeYork CountyCabin Creek Dam, Conewago (Pinchot) Dam, Lake Lehman Dam, Lake Marburg Dam, Lake Meade Dam, Lake Pahagaco, Lake Redman Dam, Lake Williams Dam, Lawrence Baker Sheppard Dam, Sheppard Myers Dam, Indian Rock Dam, and Yoe Borough Basin #1 and #2 Dam.Source: Adams County 2014 All-Hazard Mitigation Plan Update, Franklin County Emergency Management director, Lebanon County 2-13 Hazard Mitigation Plan and York County 2013 Hazard Mitigation Plan.View CommentsView CommentsAbout Us Staff Directory Careers Accessibility Support Site Map Legals Our Ethical Principles Terms of Service Privacy Policy Your California Privacy Rights / Privacy PolicyDo Not Sell My Info / Cookie PolicyContact Us Support Local Businesses Advertise Your Business Advertising Terms and Conditions Buy and Sell Help Center Subscriber Guide My Account Give Feedback Licensing & ReprintsSubscribe Today Newsletters Mobile Apps Facebook Twitter E-Edition Storytellers Archives RSS FeedsJobs Cars Homes Classifieds Education Reviewed 10Best USA TODAY Sports+ Reach Local© 2022 www.ydr.com.

But Valley Water, the agency that manages the Anderson Dam and Reservoir, says it has already lowered the reservoir’s water below the level initially sought by federal officials — and that the total drainage the federal government now demands would actually make the dam more vulnerable to earthquake damage, while also reducing water supplies and causing environmental harm. The reservoir, in a gorge 3 miles east of U.S. 101 between Morgan Hill and San Jose, is one of 10 storing water for the Santa Clara Valley Water District, now known as Valley Water. Built in 1950, it can hold 89,073 acre-feet of water, more than half of the 170,000 acre-feet stored in all of the district’s reservoirs. Blanchard; John Valley Water officials have known since 2008 that a 6.6 magnitude earthquake on the Calaveras Fault at the 240-foot earthen dam could cause it to collapse. Over the years, the agency has lowered water levels and reported its progress to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The reservoir, at current levels, “provides a buttressing effect” for the dam’s intake structure, Christopher Hakes, a Valley Water dam safety official, said in a Dec. 31 letter to FERC. “Lowering reservoir levels beyond the current level would decrease the structural reliability of the intake structure” and its protection against earthquakes. FERC’s dam safety director, David Capka, was unconvinced. He ordered Hakes in a letter Thursday to drain the reservoir “as quickly as you can,” starting the process by Oct. 1 and completing it before the winter of 2021-22. In the meantime, Capka said, Valley Water can look for emergency water supplies and work with federal, state and local agencies to “minimize environmental impacts.” “It is unacceptable to maintain the reservoir at an elevation higher than necessary when it can be reduced, thereby decreasing the risk to public safety and the large population downstream of Anderson Dam,” Capka wrote. “Your actions to date do not demonstrate an appropriate sense of urgency.” In response, Valley Water’s chief executive, Norma Camacho, said in a statement Monday that “the demand to empty Anderson Reservoir could result in unsafe consequences.” But the local district lacks authority to defy federal regulators. Valley Water spokesman Matt Keller said the district’s Board of Directors would address the issue shortly. The district is due to start work in 2022 on a five-year earthquake retrofit for the dam. Camacho said legislation has been introduced in Sacramento to speed up the regulatory process for the retrofit.

So they fly to them The district reduced the storage level of the reservoir to 68% of capacity in 2008, then to 58%. It says it has now lowered the level to 45 feet above drainage, 10 feet below the level demanded by Capka in December. Still, a spillover from the dam during heavy rains three years ago sent water pouring down Coyote Creek and into San Jose, inundating neighborhoods in one of the region’s worst floods in decades.

The district has alternate sources of water, including the State Water Project and the federal Central Valley Project, which combined furnish more than half its supply, along with groundwater. But Camacho, the chief executive, said draining the reservoir would not only be unsafe but also environmentally destructive. “The inability to keep a consistent flow in Coyote Creek downstream of the dam year-round would significantly impact sensitive native fish, amphibians, reptiles, wetlands, and riparian habitats,” she said. “Water quality could also be significantly impacted downstream of the dam.” The dispute coincided with, but was apparently unrelated to, the latest round of water wars between the Trump administration and California. On Thursday, the state sued the federal government over new rules that supply more water to Central Valley farmers by increasing pumping from the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta. The suit said the diversion violates environmental laws and would harm salmon and other endangered fish in the delta estuary.

(Courtesy BC Ministry of Mines) Poor design led to last summer’s catastrophic failure of a British Columbia mine tailings pond. That’s the conclusion of an investigation ordered by provincial officials and released Friday. Mine critics in Southeast Alaska says the report illustrates their concerns about Canadian mines in watersheds that drain into or near the Inside Passage. https://media.ktoo.org/2015/02/30PolleyRpt2.mp3 The engineering report identifies the likely cause of Aug. 4’s dam failure at Mount Polley, an open-pit, copper and gold mine in east-central British Columbia. A small part of the dam collapsed and millions of gallons of silty water poured through, widened the gap and sending a huge amount of water into nearby creeks and lakes. The report says the breach was caused by failure of the dam’s foundation. It says too much weight was put on an underground layer of glacial sand and gravel that developers and inspectors didn’t know about. It says the dam’s face was too steep. It also says the pond behind the dam was very full and the weight triggered the collapse. Sitka Mayor Mim McConnell is among those saying the report gives credence to concerns voiced by Southeast Alaska leaders. “We need to protect our waters. And what they do upstream does affect us. It could have a huge impact if there were another spill. And the United States has to have a say on what happens in Canada on this particular issue,” she says. The report recommends more stringent standards for tailings-pond design, as well as better government inspections. Both could affect other mines in the province, including projects under development near waterways that flow through Alaska. Karina Briño is president of the Mining Association of British Columbia. She says the report could speed, rather than slow, permits needed for new development. “Decisions have been put on hold because we were waiting for this report. That clarity from government and the regulators will be helpful for the industry,” she says. She says mining companies are going through the report. And they’re committed to build safe mines. “A very significant part of the process is understanding what the root cause of the breach was and what are some of the measures they are recommending,” Briño says. “In my mind and in the minds of many other Alaskans it’s whether business as usual will be changed fast enough,” says Juneau’s Heather Hardcastle, a gillnetter and co-owner of Taku River Reds, which catches and markets salmon. She doubts serious changes will happen, because of the report, since the provincial government is doing all it can to support mine development. B.C. Premier Christy Clark this month announced her government would increase the Ministry of Mines by nearly 10 million. https://media.ktoo.org/2015/02/Mount-Polley-dam-breach-video-BC.mp4 “It certainly is a concern about the speed at which projects in B.C. for the last five to eight years have been evaluated, permitted, developed and constructed. And Mount Polley does raised red flags about the quality and frequency of inspections,” she says. Mount Polley does not drain into any Alaska watersheds. But its owner, Imperial Metals, is about to open the Red Chris Mine near the Stikine River, which enters the ocean near Wrangell and Petersburg. Another mine under exploration is the KSM, which will operate near two watersheds that drain into the Pacific within 50 miles of Ketchikan. And, there’s an attempt to reopen the Tulsequah Chief, a mine on a tributary of the Taku River, near Juneau. “There’s nothing that the Canadian government or their environmental people can say to us that would make us feel better,” says Ketchikan’s Rob Sanderson Jr., who co-chairs the United Tribal Transboundary Mining Work Group. He’s concerned about impacts on subsistence and commercial fishing. “I think they’re again going back to that Band-Aid approach. I don’t think that’s going to hold,” he says. Mine critics are lobbying the U.S. State Department to put transboundary mines before a panel that resolves cross-border conflicts. So far, there’s been no action.

Vast Brazil lawsuit in UK against BHP over 2015 dam failure hits buffers | ReutersDiscover Thomson ReutersDirectory of sitesLoginContactSupportfor-phone-onlyfor-tablet-portrait-upfor-tablet-landscape-upfor-desktop-upfor-wide-desktop-upCommoditiesUpdated Vast Brazil lawsuit in UK against BHP over 2015 dam failure hits buffersBy Kirstin Ridley4 Min ReadLONDON (Reuters) -A 200,000-strong Brazilian claimant group said on Wednesday it had failed to resurrect a 5.0 billion pound (6.9 billion) English lawsuit against Anglo-Australian mining giant BHP over a devastating 2015 dam failure.FILE PHOTO: Men take out a bag from a house flooded with mud after a dam owned by Vale SA and BHP Billiton Ltd burst, in Barra Longa, Brazil, November 7, 2015. REUTERS/Ricardo Moraes/File PhotoThe Court of Appeal agreed with a lower court that the vast group action was an abuse of process, that claimants were already able to seek redress in Brazil and that the case would be “irredeemably unmanageable” if allowed to proceed.Tom Goodhead, the PGMBM lawyer representing the claimants, said it was “a sad day for the English justice system” after senior judges agreed that the claim, relating to Brazil’s worst environmental disaster, should be struck out.The collapse of the Fundao dam, owned by the Samarco venture between BHP and Brazilian iron ore mining giant Vale, killed 19 and sent a flood of mining waste into communities, the Doce river and the Atlantic Ocean, 650 km (400 miles) away.The landmark case was the latest battle to establish whether multinationals can be held liable for the conduct of subsidiaries abroad.The UK Supreme Court in 2019 allowed Zambian villagers to sue miner Vedanta in England for alleged pollution in Africa and in February permitted Nigerian farmers and fishermen to pursue Royal Dutch Shell over oil spills in the Niger Delta.But the English claim against BHP was first struck out in November after a High Court judge ruled that allowing it to proceed here would be like “trying to build a house of cards in a wind tunnel”.Goodhead said he was surprised and disappointed by the Court of Appeal decision, which sent “a poor message about corporate responsibility and legal consequences for wrongdoing”.“We are committed to supporting the victims of this tragedy. We will now take stock and assess our options as to how justice can best be achieved,” he said.BHP welcomed the decision, which it said reinforced its view that the proceedings duplicated existing and ongoing remediation efforts and legal proceedings in Brazil. It said it remained fully committed to doing “the right thing” for victims.BHP says it and Vale each poured about 1.7 billion into the Renova Foundation, set up in 2016 by BHP’s Brazilian division, Samarco and Vale to manage 42 reparation projects, including providing financial aid to indigenous families, rebuilding villages and establishing new water supply systems.BHP said Renova has spent nearly 12 billion reais (2.17 billion) across the projects to date.A United Nations expert report, published in September, said the disaster decimated the livelihoods of more than three million people, leaving locals exposed to dust and heavy metals in mud, that information about toxicity was inadequate and that all reparation projects were behind schedule.In October, Brazilian federal prosecutors filed a lawsuit against BHP and Vale, alleging compensation packages were too low and forced victims to waive rights in other legal proceedings.Renova has insisted that projects such as water quality monitoring and environmental repairs are on track, while the miners reject allegations they are not complying with obligations and of wrongdoing.(1 = 0.7284 pounds)(1 = 5.5210 reais)Reporting by Kirstin Ridley; Editing by Edmund BlairOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.AppsNewslettersAdvertise with UsAdvertising GuidelinesCookiesTerms of UsePrivacyDo Not Sell My Personal InformationAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

(Google Map Photo)ORANGE COUNTY, CA — Federal engineers have raised an alarm that a "significant flood event," such as a series of strong Pacific storms, could breach the spillway of the aging Prado Dam, in Orange County. Such an event has the potential to drown out dozens of downstream communities, from Anaheim's Disneyland to Newport Beach, the Army Corps of Engineers Los Angeles District reported.After conducting an assessment of the 78-year-old structure earlier this month, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers announced that it was raising the dam's risk category from "moderate" to "high urgency." Over 1.4 million people live and work below Prado Dam, with property valued at over 61 billion, including Disneyland and many high-end resorts and properties in Newport Beach.Find out what's happening in Orange Countywith free, real-time updates from Patch.Let's go!"Public safety is our number one priority," Col. Aaron Barta, commander of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Los Angeles District, said in a recent release. The Corps is currently reviewing all dams in the area and prioritizing the highest risks, of which Prado Dam tops the list. Any modifications to improve the spillway won't begin for at least two years, they said.Prado Dam was authorized for development in 1936, to protect the populous communities downstream, and was still under construction during the flood in the spring of 1938, when two mighty Pacific storms swept through the region and dumped over a year's worth of rain in just a few days, according to the Orange County Historical Society. During that time, floodwaters swamped significant swaths of Orange County under six-feet of water for several weeks, including Anaheim and what is now Santa Ana. Find out what's happening in Orange Countywith free, real-time updates from Patch.Let's go!During a 100-year flood, Prado Dam is the only stopgap between safety and catastrophe for hundreds of thousands of people. In 2005, a leak in the damn during a series of storms forced hundreds to evacuate their homes in nearby Corona. The latest look at Prado Dam has left the Army Corps of Engineers concerned about what another devastating storm would do to the dam."Our concern right now is about the concrete slab of the spillway and how well it will perform if water were to spill over the top of the dam," said Lillian Doherty, the Army Corps' division chief, told the Los Angeles Times. "We will determine whether or not it is as reliable as it should be."Located beside the 91 Freeway, on the border of Riverside and Orange counties, the dam contains little to no water for much of the year. During periods of heavy rain, however, the structure is intended to collect water and prevent flooding along the Santa Ana River. Doherty said her agency is working with a national team of experts to develop interim and permanent risk-reduction measures at the dam, as well as public outreach strategies to alert the estimated 1.4 million people who live and work in 29 communities downstream.The sudden downgrade in the structure's evaluation comes after major structural problems have been identified in California dams. In February 2017, a concrete spillway at the Oroville Dam disintegrated during heavy rains and triggered the evacuation of more than 180,000 people. The head of the California Water Resources Department, which operates the dam, was removed after an independent probe found the failure was the result of a lax safety culture. That same year, the Corps of Engineers discovered that the 60-year-old Whittier Narrows Dam, about 40 miles to the west of Prado Dam, was structurally unsafe and posed a potentially catastrophic risk to more than 1 million people in working-class communities along the San Gabriel River floodplain. In that case, engineers found that intense storms could trigger a premature opening of that dam's massive spillway, swamping homes, schools, factories, and roads from Pico Rivera to Long Beach. Engineers also found that the earthen structure could fail if water were to flow over its crest. The Corps estimates it will cost roughly 600 million in federal funds to upgrade the Whittier Narrows facility, which has been reclassified as the agency's highest priority nationally because of the risk of "very significant loss of life and economic impacts." Given concerns that Prado Dam poses a flood threat to much of Orange County, the agency is collaborating with Los Angeles, Orange and Riverside counties and several dozen municipalities to develop emergency plans to implement before repairs to the dams are completed. "A troubling theme is emerging as the Corps reviews its portfolio of large flood control systems that were built a long time ago and are now showing signs of severe stress," said Daniel Swain, a UCLA climate scientist told the LA Times. "Federal engineers are finding that these systems are not as resilient as they thought they were and that the frequency of what were regarded as once-in-a-lifetime storms is increasing significantly."Get more local news delivered straight to your inbox.

Aging U.S. dams pose risk to thousands living in their shadowsNews Sports Autos Business Michigan Life + Home Entertainment Opinion Obituaries Aging U.S. dams pose risk to thousandsDavid A. Lieb, Michael Casey and Michelle MinkoffAssociated PressView Comments On a cold morning last March, Kenny Angel got a frantic knock on his door. Two workers from a utility company in northern Nebraska had come with a stark warning: Get out of your house.Just a little over a quarter-mile upstream, the 92-year-old Spencer Dam was straining to contain the swollen, ice-covered Niobrara River after an unusually intense snow and rainstorm. The workers had tried but failed to force open the dam’s frozen wooden spillway gates. So, fearing the worst, they fled in their truck, stopping to warn Angel before driving away without him.Minutes later, the dam came crashing down, unleashing a wave of water carrying ice chunks the size of cars. Angel’s home was wiped away; his body was never found.“He had about a 5-minute notice, with no prior warning the day before,” said Scott Angel, one of Kenny’s brothers.State inspectors had given the dam a “fair” rating less than a year earlier. Until it failed, it looked little different from thousands of others across the U.S. — and that could portend a problem.A more than two-year investigation by the Associated Press has found scores of dams nationwide in even worse condition and in equally dangerous locations. They loom over homes, businesses, highways or entire communities that could face life-threatening floods if the dams don’t hold.A review of federal data and reports obtained under state open records laws identified 1,688 high-hazard dams rated in poor or unsatisfactory condition as of last year in 44 states and Puerto Rico. The actual number is almost certainly higher: Some states declined to provide condition ratings for their dams, claiming exemptions to public record requests. Others simply haven’t rated all their dams due to lack of funding, staffing or authority to do so.Out of 1,028 Michigan dams listed in the data, 19, or nearly 2%, were categorized as both high hazard and in unsatisfactory condition.Deaths from dam failures have declined since a series of catastrophic collapses in the 1970s prompted the federal and state governments to step up their safety efforts. Yet about 1,000 dams have failed over the past four decades, killing 34 people, according to Stanford University’s National Performance of Dams Program.Built for flood control, irrigation, water supply, hydropower, recreation or industrial waste storage, the nation’s dams are over a half-century old on average. Some are no longer adequate to handle the intense rainfall and floods of a changing climate. Yet they are being relied upon to protect more and more people as housing developments spring up nearby.“There are thousands of people in this country that are living downstream from dams that are probably considered deficient given current safety standards,” said Mark Ogden, a former Ohio dam safety official who is now a technical specialist with the Association of State Dam Safety Officials.The association estimates it would take more than 70 billion to repair and modernize the nation’s more than 90,000 dams. But unlike much other infrastructure, most U.S. dams are privately owned. That makes it difficult for regulators to require improvements from operators who are unable or unwilling to pay the steep costs.“Most people have no clue about the vulnerabilities when they live downstream from these private dams,” said Craig Fugate, a former administrator at the Federal Emergency Management Agency. “When they fail, they don’t fail with warning. They just fail, and suddenly you can find yourself in a situation where you have a wall of water and debris racing toward your house with very little time, if any, to get out.”Beyond expectationsIt’s unclear whether Angel, a 71-year-old Vietnam War veteran, declined to flee or simply ran out of time after workers with the Nebraska Public Power District warned him that water was overtopping the dam near Spencer, a town of fewer than 500 residents.When last inspected in April 2018, Spencer Dam’s “fair” rating was accompanied by an ominous notation: “Deficiencies exist which could lead to dam failure during rare, extreme storm events.”Tim Gokie, chief engineer of Nebraska’s dam safety program, said the warning was due to past water seepage the power utility addressed by installing a drain system. Ultimately, Gokie said, the rising Niobrara River simply overwhelmed the concrete and earthen dam, which was built in 1927 to generate hydroelectricity, not for flood control.“The fact was that it was just an unprecedented situation,” Nebraska Public Power District spokesman Mark Becker said. “It was beyond what everybody anticipated.”Nebraska was among the states hardest hit by storms and floods this year that have caused an estimated 1.5 billion in damage to roads, dams, utilities and other infrastructure in 28 states, according to an AP analysis.A National Climate Assessment released by the White House last year noted growing frequency and intensity of storms as the climate changes. That can push some dams beyond what they were designed to handle.Even if kept in good condition, thousands of dams could be at risk because of extreme rainstorms, said Fugate, the former FEMA official.“These are like ticking bombs just sitting there, waiting for the wrong conditions to occur to cause catastrophic failure,” he said.Michigan impactThe nation’s dams are categorized as high, significant or low hazard in the National Inventory of Dams database. High hazard means loss of human life is likely if a dam were to fail. A significant rating means no deaths are likely, although economic and environmental damage are possible.There is no national standard for inspecting dams, leading to a patchwork of state regulations. Some states inspect high-hazard dams every year while others wait up to five years. Some states never inspect low-hazard dams – though even farm ponds can eventually pose a high hazard as housing developments encroach.Dam conditions are supposed to be rated as unsatisfactory, poor, fair or satisfactory. But the ratings are subjective, varying by state and the interpretations of individual inspectors, and are not always publicly disclosed.Since the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks, the U.S. government has cited national security grounds in refusing to include dams’ conditions in its inventory, which was updated most recently in 2018. But the AP was able to determine both condition and hazard ratings for more than 25,000 dams across the country through public records requests.The tally includes some of the nation’s most well-known dams, such as Hoover Dam along the Colorado River, but mostly involves privately owned dams. Many are used for recreation.The AP then examined inspection reports for hundreds of high-hazard dams in poor or unsatisfactory condition. Those reports cited a variety of problems: leaks that can indicate a dam is failing internally; unrepaired erosion from past instances of overtopping; holes from burrowing animals; tree growth that can destabilize earthen dams; and spillways too small to handle a large flood. Some dams were so overgrown with vegetation that they couldn’t be fully inspected.Georgia led the nation with nearly 200 high-hazard dams in unsatisfactory or poor condition, according to the AP’s analysis.Nineteen Michigan dams were categorized as both high hazard and in unsatisfactory condition. Those were:■Alcona Dam in Alcona County;■Au Train Dam in Alger County;■Boardman Dam in Grand Traverse County;■Bond Falls Dam and Victoria Diversion Dam in Ontonagon County;■Cascade Dam in Kent County;■Chalk Hill Dam in Menominee County■Cheboygan Dam in Cheboygan County;■Cooke Dam in Iosco County;■Edenville Dam in Gladwin County;■Four Mile Dam in Alpena County;■French Landing Dam in Wayne County;■Hodenpyl Dam in Manistee County;■Lower Dam No 3 in Marquette County;■Portage Plant Dam and Sturgis Dam in St. Joseph County;■Prickett Diversion Dam in Baraga County;■Secord Dam in Gladwin County;■Tippy Dam in Manistee County.All of them were inspected within the past 10 years except for the Victoria Diversion Dam, which was last inspected in 1997, and the Portage Plant Dam, which was last inspected in 2002, according to the data.One of the most common problems for aging dams are spillways incapable of handling an extreme rainfall event.If water can’t escape quickly enough through spillways, it could flow over the top of a dam, which increases the probability of rapid erosion that can cause it to collapse.In Huron Township, high water levels raised alarm among residents in May about the condition of the French Landing Dam. The township’s public safety department insisted that the dam was not in danger of failing.Demand on resourcesIn a 1982 report summarizing its nationwide dam assessment, the Corps of Engineers said most dam owners were unwilling to modify, repair or maintain the structures, and most states were unwilling to spend enough money for an effective dam safety program.Since then, every state but Alabama has created a dam safety program.But the Great Recession a decade ago forced many states to make widespread budget and personnel cuts. Since a low point in 2011, states’ total spending on dam safety has grown by about one-third to nearly 59 million in the 2019 fiscal year while staffing levels have risen by about one-fifth, according to data collected by the Corps of Engineers.Michigan’s budget for dam safety in 2019 was 397,215.The Association of State Dam Safety Officials says almost every state faces a serious need to pump additional money and manpower into dam safety programs.“If you don’t have the staff to inspect a dam, or don’t have the authority to do that, you don’t know what the problems are,” said the association’s Ogden.“If you are able to do the inspection but you can’t follow up, and you have dam owners who don’t have the resources to fix their dam, then ultimately you know what the problem is but you can’t get it addressed,” he added.Until Angel’s death in Nebraska this year, the last fatal dam failure in the U.S. occurred on the Hawaiian island of Kauai in 2006.An earthen wall of the Kaloko Reservoir collapsed during heavy rains and sent a wave of water rushing down a hillside. Seven people, including a pregnant woman, were killed on Bruce Fehring’s property, including his daughter, son-in-law and grandson.Fehring, who wasn’t there at the time, got a phone call from a neighbor saying something terrible had happened. He was shocked by the scene.“It took a while to register, and I went, ‘Oh my God, everything’s been washed away,’” Fehring recalled. “I mean, you have no idea the power of water (until) you see what it can do in a very short amount of time.”Dam owner James Pflueger pleaded no contest to felony reckless endangerment and was sentenced to seven months of confinement and five years of probation. His property company pleaded no contest to seven counts of manslaughter. Prosecutors said Pflueger had filled in the dam’s spillway while attempting to make space for a waterfront development.The victims’ families and those whose property was damaged, including actress Bette Midler, agreed to a 25 million civil settlement. Though categorized by the state as low hazard at the time it failed, Kaloko Reservoir is now listed as a high-hazard facility in poor condition . It remains largely unrepaired.View Comments Staff Directory Site Map Legals Terms of Service Privacy Policy Your California Privacy Rights / Privacy PolicyDo Not Sell My Info / Cookie PolicyContact Us Advertise Your Business Buy and Sell Licensing & Reprints Help Center Subscriber Guide My Account Give FeedbackSubscribe Today Newsletters Mobile Apps Facebook Twitter E-Edition Archives RSS FeedsJobs Cars Homes Classifieds Renvy.com Michigan.com© 2022 www.detroitnews.com.

On hard-hit Maui, floods damaged homes and overtopped a historical dam, forcing residents to evacuate. National Hawaii Flooding Prompts Emergency Declaration, Evacuations And Fears Of Dam Failure Facebook Twitter Flipboard Email March 10, 202111:18 AM ET Rachel Treisman Twitter Enlarge this image A road is flooded near the breached Kaupakalua Dam in the Haiku area of the Hawaiian island of Maui on Monday. Maggie T. Sutrov via Reuters hide caption toggle caption Maggie T. Sutrov via Reuters A road is flooded near the breached Kaupakalua Dam in the Haiku area of the Hawaiian island of Maui on Monday. Maggie T. Sutrov via Reuters The governor of Hawaii declared a state of emergency after severe flooding across the state's islands prompted evacuations, damaged homes and raised alarm over a possible dam failure. Gov. David Ige signed the proclamation on Tuesday to release state general funds to help those impacted by the extreme weather, which he said is expected to continue until Friday. The order covers the counties of Hawaii, Maui, Kalawao and Kauai, as well as the city and county of Honolulu. Residents of the town of Haleiwa on the North Shore of Oahu were ordered on Tuesday afternoon to evacuate because of "catastrophic flooding." Officials lifted the evacuation order some seven hours later but said road closures remained in place. Officials in Maui, which was hit especially hard by the heavy rainfall, are still assessing the extent of the damage. They said intense rainfall damaged bridges, resulted in the overtopping of the century-old Kaupakalua Dam, rendered several roads impassable and damaged or destroyed at least some half-dozen homes. "When you see flood damage in the light of day, it's a reminder of the sheer power of fast-moving water," Maui County Mayor Michael Victorino said in a county news release. "We are so fortunate there were no reported deaths or injuries." Evacuations were ordered in Maui County, Hawaii, on Monday after flash flooding prompted concerns that a dam had been breached.Gov. David Ige urged residents to stay out of the area downstream from the Kaupakulua Dam until the danger had passed. pic.twitter.com/GGjgL08MXW— NPR (@NPR) March 9, 2021 Victorino said at a Monday news briefing that this is "a real flooding situation we have not seen in a long time," adding that some residents had told him this was the worst flooding they had seen in 25 years. Parts of Maui had been hit with between 3 and 19 inches of rain as of noon local time on Tuesday, according to preliminary rainfall totals from the National Weather Service. Ensuing flash flooding trapped some residents in their homes and forced those in the vicinity of the overflowing Kaupakalua Dam to evacuate. Climate Risk Hits Home Most Tenants Get No Information About Flooding. It Can Cost Them Dearly Maui County on Monday ordered everyone downstream of the Kaupakalua Dam in the northern town of Haiku to leave the area, saying heavy rains had led to the dam cresting. The dam was reported breached at about 3:21 p.m. local time on Monday, according to officials. However, they announced the following day that "after closer inspection," they had determined there was in fact "no structural damage." The Kaupakalua Dam — one of the oldest agricultural dams on the island of Maui — is 57 feet high and 400 feet long and can hold 68 million gallons of water. It is owned by the East Maui Irrigation Co. and Mahi Pono Holdings Inc. Hawaii's Department of Land and Natural Resources said in a statement that the dam has been the focus of regulators and was already scheduled for removal this summer because of structural deficiencies. Regulators had ordered the owners to keep the dam's reservoir empty during normal operations, noting they have done so except in the case of storms, when water is passed through quickly. East Maui Irrigation Co. officials monitored the Kaupakalua Reservoir overnight on Monday, according to an update from Maui County. They said that water levels remained above normal but approximately 3 feet below the top of the dam. Shan Tsutsui, chief operating officer of Mahi Pono, reiterated in a statement reported Tuesday by Maui Now that the dam had not failed. "Out of concerns for the safety of the surrounding community, the highway was closed and residents were ordered to evacuate upon our recommendation," he said. "At this time, the over-topping of the dam has ceased. However, our crews are actively monitoring the situation and will continue monitoring the water levels until it returns to a safe level." County officials have asked evacuees to stay away from the area until there is an "all clear" announcement. Maui's fire department responded to more than a dozen calls for help from residents trapped by rising waters, officials said on Monday. Officials said that one bridge in the area was "washed out" and another "displaced." They added that several portions of roads had been washed away, flooded or blocked by debris. National Hawaii Takes A New Spot In U.S. Rainfall Records, After Hurricane Lane Drenches State The flood advisory in Maui County expired early Wednesday morning local time, though a flash flood watch remains in effect through the evening. Flash flood watches are also in place for Kauai County and the city and county of Honolulu through Wednesday evening local time, according to the National Weather Service. The National Weather Service said heavy rainfall shifted to Oahu on Tuesday, closing multiple roads and reportedly damaging several homes in the rural community of Hauula. Honolulu Mayor Rick Blangiardi urged residents on Tuesday to heed evacuation orders. "The storm at this point in time is most serious. It is life threatening," he said. "If you've been asked to ... evacuate, please do so immediately." Hawaii News Now reported that two individuals in Honolulu were swept away by raging waters in separate incidents. A 27-year-old man had been displaced about 100 yards and was rescued from the top of his truck, while the search for the other individual was unsuccessful and was slated to resume early local time on Wednesday. Honolulu officials also said Tuesday that some 8,200 gallons of partially treated wastewater had spilled within the grounds of a local wastewater treatment plant and partly on the grounds of the James Campbell National Wildlife Refuge. They said Honolulu's Department of Environmental Services responded to the sewer overflow, which lasted over two hours, and would determine warning signs and water sampling on Wednesday morning. state of emergency dam flooding Hawaii Facebook Twitter Flipboard Email Read & Listen Home News Culture Music Podcasts & Shows Connect Newsletters Facebook Twitter Instagram Press Contact & Help About NPR Overview Diversity Ethics Finances Public Editor Corrections Get Involved Support Public Radio Sponsor NPR NPR Careers NPR Shop NPR Events NPR Extra Terms of Use Privacy Your Privacy Choices Text Only Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
Obama: Mosul Dam No Longer Under ISIS Control - ABC News ABC NewsVideoLiveShowsGuns in AmericaJan. 6LOG INInterest Successfully AddedWe'll notify you here with news aboutTurn on desktop notifications for breaking stories about interest? OffOnObama: Mosul Dam No Longer Under ISIS ControlDangerous dam could drown city with 65-foot wall of water.ByLee Ferran, Terry Moran, Rym Momtaz and Mazin FaiqAugust 18, 2014, 12:04 PM1:29A general view of the Mosul Dam in Mosul, 360 kilometers (225 miles) northwest of Baghdad, Iraq, Oct. 31, 2007.Khalid Mohammed/AP Photo&#151; -- President Obama said today that Kurdish and Iraqi forces have retaken the Mosul Dam in Iraq, a decaying, dangerous structure that, with or without brutal extremists in charge, threatens millions of people downstream.Earlier today Gen. Karim Fatah, commander of a Kurdish peshmerga battalion near the dam, told ABC News Kurdish troops had retaken key parts of the dam from the extremist Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) but the battle was ongoing. The Iraqi military followed with a similar statement. The U.S. military said it conducted more than a dozen airstrikes today in support of the Kurdish and Iraqi troops.Just over an hour before the president spoke, a spokesperson for the U.S. State Department said only that there had been “progress around the dam” and that the operation was “ongoing.”President Obama is the highest level official to say without equivocation that the U.S.-backed forces had retaken the dam – calling it a “major step forward.”ISIS managed to take control of the dam last week, an eventuality about which a spokesperson for the U.S. State Department had previously said the U.S. government was “extremely concerned.”Recapture of Critical Dam in Iraq Is a Success, Obama SaysPentagon Releases Video of Airstrikes Near Mosul DamWhy Control of a Terrifying Dam in Iraq Is Life or Death for Half Million PeopleSunday President Obama sent a letter to Congress notifying lawmakers that he had authorized airstrikes against ISIS targets at the dam “in the national security and foreign policy interests of the United States.”“The failure of the Mosul Dam could threaten the lives of large numbers of civilians, endanger U.S. personnel and facilities, including the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad, and prevent the Iraqi government from providing critical services to the Iraqi populace,” the letter said.The stark language actually may have downplayed the danger posed by the dam, according to prior U.S. estimates of the damage that could be caused should the dam be breached – or even if it is simply left alone to degrade on its own without the constant repair work that has been critical to keeping the dam right side up for the past 30 years.The Mosul Dam was built in the mid-1980s on what reports indicate was a terrible spot to build a sprawling dam.“Mosul Dam, the largest dam in Iraq, was constructed on a foundation of soluble soils that are continuously dissolving, resulting in the formation of cavities and voids underground that place the dam at risk for failure,” said an urgent letter sent from David Petraeus, then commanding general of the U.S. Army, and Ryan Crocker, then U.S. Ambassador to Iraq, to Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki in 2007.The dam requires “extraordinary engineering measures” -- namely constant grouting operations -- to fill in the holes and “maintain the structural integrity and operating capability of the dam,” according to a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) report from the same year.For 30 years –- and through several periods of violent conflict -- the Iraqi government has managed to keep the dam upright by continuously pumping in literally tons of grout like an industrial version of the little Dutch boy, as a geotechnical expert who worked on the dam put it.But the U.S. says any failure of the dam could be “catastrophic.”“[T]he most severe impact of a dam failure would be [for] the City of Mosul, located 50 kilometers [31 miles] downstream of the dam,” Petraeus’ and Crocker’s 2007 letter said. “Assuming a worse [sic] case scenario, an instantaneous failure of Mosul Dam filled to its maximum operating level could result in a flood wave over 20 meters [65 feet] deep at the city of Mosul, which would result in a significant loss of life and property.”Mosul is estimated to be home to more than 1.5 million people. Flood waters, albeit at a lower level, could reach all the way to Baghdad, more than 200 miles further down the Tigris.A 2011 report written by a USACE official and published in Water Power magazine estimated failure “could lead to as many as 500,000 civilian deaths.”Recently a U.S. official confirmed that the dire 2007 estimate still stands. After Mosul, flood waters would travel for eight to 10 days before reaching Baghdad, where the U.S. Embassy there could see one to four meters of water, the official said.The U.S. State Department said earlier this month that control of the dam was one of ISIS’s goals in Iraq. Late last week the extremist group got its wish, took control of the dam and immediately inherited the urgent grouting problems.Friday an Iraqi government official said that the lead dam engineer and his team were still on site and operating the dam at ISIS’s behest. Supplies to continue grouting operations were available and the water level was also being kept lower than normal to reduce the risk of a breach, the official said then.ISIS may not necessarily want the dam to fail, considering the extremist group controls portions of the land that would be flooded. The dam is also a “key source” of power and water for the surrounding area, making it a vital piece of infrastructure either way for whoever is in control, another State Department spokesperson told ABC News last week.CLICK HERE to return to the ABC News Investigative Unit homepage.Top StoriesFauci experiencing Paxlovid rebound after testing positive for COVID this monthJun 29, 11:12 AMWoman walking with baby stroller shot to death in NYC4 hours agoFormer Trump White House counsel Pat Cipollone subpoenaed by Jan. 6 committee4 hours agoGOP must choose Trump or the Constitution, Liz Cheney warns: 'It is undeniable'4 hours agoTrump White House attorney disputes Hutchinson's testimony about handwritten noteJun 28, 11:07 PMABC News Live24/7 coverage of breaking news and live eventsABC News NetworkPrivacy PolicyYour CA Privacy RightsChildren's Online Privacy PolicyInterest-Based AdsAbout Nielsen MeasurementTerms of UseDo Not Sell My InfoContact UsCopyright © 2022 ABC News Internet Ventures.

An earthen wall of the Kaloko Reservoir collapsed during heavy rains and sent a wave of water and mud rushing down a hillside, killing seven. Until the death of one man in Nebraska this year, the last fatal dam failure in the U.S. occurred on the island of Kauai in 2006. An earthen wall of the Kaloko Reservoir collapsed during heavy rains and sent a wave of water rushing down a hillside. Seven people — including a pregnant woman — were killed on Bruce Fehring's property, including his daughter, son-in-law and grandson.Fehring, who wasn't there at the time, got a phone call from a neighbor saying something terrible had happened. He was shocked by the scene."It took a while to register, and I went, 'Oh my God, everything's been washed away,'" Fehring recalled. "I mean, you have no idea the power of water (until) you see what it can do in a very short amount of time."Dam owner James Pflueger pleaded no contest to felony reckless endangerment and was sentenced to seven months of confinement and five years of probation. His property company pleaded no contest to seven counts of manslaughter. Prosecutors said Pflueger had filled in the dam's spillway while attempting to make space for a waterfront development.The victims' families and those whose property was damaged, including actress Bette Midler, agreed to a 25 million civil settlement. Though categorized by the state as low hazard at the time it failed, Kaloko Reservoir is now listed as a high-hazard facility in poor condition. It remains largely unrepaired.An investigation by The Associated Press has found scores of dams nationwide in poor or unsatisfactory condition, and in dangerous locations. They loom over homes, businesses, highways or entire communities that could face life-threatening floods if the dams don't hold.At Lake Dunlap Dam near San Antonio, a security camera was rolling one day last May as it usually does, helping dam operators monitor for signs of trouble.The day, bright and clear, was unremarkable, the water flowing steadily over the top of the dam as it was supposed to. Suddenly and without warning, a massive spillway gate on the 91-year-old dam broke loose and erupted from the surface of the lake, crashing to the river bed below with such force that it shook the camera. Water poured through the opening in a gushing waterfall.No one was hurt, but scores of lakefront homeowners were affected: their boats stranded along docks overlooking the former lakebed, their property values in the tank. Just two months earlier in northern Nebraska, another dam failure had cost a man his life.The 92-year-old Spencer Dam gave way after an unusually intense snow and rainstorm. Just minutes before the tragedy, two electric utility workers had tried unsuccessfully to free the frozen wooden spillway gates and then frantically warned Kenny Angel to flee from his nearby home. But it was too late. Angel's home was washed away in a flood carrying ice chunks the size of cars; his body has never been found.Both old dams had been described by state inspectors as "good" or "fair" less than a year earlier. Until they failed, they looked little different from thousands of others across the U.S. — and that could portend a problem. A review of federal data and reports obtained under state open records laws identified 1,688 high-hazard dams rated in poor or unsatisfactory condition as of last year in 44 states and Puerto Rico. The actual number is almost certainly higher: Some states declined to provide condition ratings for their dams, claiming exemptions to public record requests. Others simply haven't rated all their dams due to lack of funding, staffing or authority to do so.Deaths from dam failures have declined since a series of catastrophic collapses in the 1970s prompted the federal and state governments to step up their safety efforts. Yet about 1,000 dams have failed over the past four decades, killing 34 people, according to Stanford University's National Performance of Dams Program.Built for flood control, irrigation, water supply, hydropower, recreation or industrial waste storage, the nation's dams are over a half-century old on average. Some are no longer adequate to handle the intense rainfall and floods of a changing climate. Yet they are being relied upon to protect more and more people as housing developments spring up nearby."There are thousands of people in this country that are living downstream from dams that are probably considered deficient given current safety standards," said Mark Ogden, a former Ohio dam safety official who is now a technical specialist with the Association of State Dam Safety Officials.The association estimates it would take more than 70 billion to repair and modernize the nation's more than 90,000 dams. But unlike much other infrastructure, most U.S. dams are privately owned. That makes it difficult for regulators to require improvements from operators who are unable or unwilling to pay the steep costs."Most people have no clue about the vulnerabilities when they live downstream from these private dams," said Craig Fugate, a former administrator at the Federal Emergency Management Agency. "When they fail, they don't fail with warning. They just fail, and suddenly you can find yourself in a situation where you have a wall of water and debris racing toward your house with very little time, if any, to get out."Nebraska DisasterIt's unclear whether Angel, a 71-year-old Vietnam War veteran, declined to flee or simply ran out of time after workers with the Nebraska Public Power District warned him that water from the Niobrara River was overtopping the dam near Spencer, a town of fewer than 500 residents."He had about a 5-minute notice, with no prior warning the day before," Scott Angel, one of Kenny's brothers, said.An attorney for Angel's wife, who wasn't home when the dam broke, has filed a 5 million lawsuit alleging negligence. It claims the power utility failed to properly maintain the dam, train its employees or inform the Angels of dangerous conditions.Even though the Angels' home was squarely in its path, the dam was rated as a "significant" rather than "high" hazard, meaning it wasn't required under Nebraska law to have a formal emergency action plan. About 20% of state-regulated high-hazard dams nationwide still lack emergency plans, according to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which maintains the national dam inventory.When last inspected in April 2018 , Spencer Dam's "fair" rating was accompanied by an ominous notation: "Deficiencies exist which could lead to dam failure during rare, extreme storm events."Tim Gokie, chief engineer of Nebraska's dam safety program, said the warning was due to past water seepage the power utility addressed by installing a drain system. Ultimately, Gokie said, the rising Niobrara River simply overwhelmed the concrete and earthen dam, which was built in 1927 to generate hydroelectricity, not for flood control."The fact was that it was just an unprecedented situation," Nebraska Public Power District spokesman Mark Becker said. "It was beyond what everybody anticipated."Nebraska was among the states hardest hit by storms and floods this year that have caused an estimated 1.5 billion in damage to roads, dams, utilities and other infrastructure in 28 states, according to an AP analysis.A National Climate Assessment released by the White House last year noted growing frequency and intensity of storms as the climate changes. That can push some dams beyond what they were designed to handle.Even if kept in good condition, thousands of dams could be at risk because of extreme rainstorms, said Fugate, the former FEMA official."These are like ticking bombs just sitting there, waiting for the wrong conditions to occur to cause catastrophic failure," he said.How Dams Are RatedThe nation's dams are categorized as high, significant or low hazard in the National Inventory of Dams database. High hazard means loss of human life is likely if a dam were to fail. A significant rating means no deaths are likely, although economic and environmental damage are possible.There is no national standard for inspecting dams, leading to a patchwork of state regulations. Some states inspect high-hazard dams every year while others wait up to five years. Some states never inspect low-hazard dams — though even farm ponds can eventually pose a high hazard as housing developments encroach.Dam conditions are supposed to be rated as unsatisfactory, poor, fair or satisfactory. But the ratings are subjective — varying by state and the interpretations of individual inspectors — and are not always publicly disclosed.Since the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks, the U.S. government has cited national security grounds in refusing to include dams' conditions in its inventory, which was updated most recently in 2018. But the AP was able to determine condition and hazard ratings for more than 25,000 dams across the country through public records requests.The tally includes some of the nation's most well-known dams, such as Hoover Dam along the Colorado River, but mostly involves privately owned dams. Many are used for recreation.The AP then examined inspection reports for hundreds of high-hazard dams in poor or unsatisfactory condition. Those reports cited a variety of problems: leaks that can indicate a dam is failing internally; unrepaired erosion from past instances of overtopping; holes from burrowing animals; tree growth that can destabilize earthen dams; and spillways too small to handle a large flood. Some dams were so overgrown with vegetation that they couldn't be fully inspected.Georgia led the nation with nearly 200 high-hazard dams in unsatisfactory or poor condition, according to the AP's analysis.Among them is Reservoir No. 1 in Atlanta, a 180 million-gallon water supply dating to the late 1800s that has been out of service much of the past few decades. The city made repairs and brought it back online in 2017, only to shut it down again after leaks were noticed.If the dam were to catastrophically fail, the water could inundate more than 1,000 homes, dozens of businesses, a railroad and a portion of Interstate 75, according to an emergency action plan .Joel Iverson has previously noticed water trickling out of the dam near the brewery he co-founded, Monday Night Brewing."If that one goes, it's going to wash away us and a lot of beer," Iverson said.The Atlanta Watershed Management Department declined the AP's request for an interview about the reservoir and instead asked for questions in writing. When those were submitted, it declined to answer them.Aging Infrastructure Increases RisksOne of the most common problems for aging dams are spillways incapable of handling an extreme rainfall event.If water can't escape quickly enough through spillways, it could flow over the top of a dam, which increases the probability of rapid erosion that can cause it to collapse.The spillway at the 107-year-old Willett Pond Dam near the Boston suburb of Norwood is capable of handling just 13% of the water flow from a serious flood before the dam is overtopped, according to a recent state inspection report. If the dam were to give way, it could send hundreds of millions of gallons of water into the heart of the city of nearly 30,000 people."We are not talking of just flooding someone's house. We are talking about covering their house," said Murray Beach, who lives on the shore of the 220-acre privately owned lake and belongs to a citizens group that has lobbied for years for the spillway to be repaired.A 2017 inspection report said improvements to the spillway could cost between 1 million and 5 million. A nonprofit that owns the lake received a 215,000 state grant last year to design spillway improvements. But there is no timeline to fix it.More than 1,300 properties lie within the dam's inundation zone, including several shopping centers and at least two elementary schools, as well as more than 70 roads and two railroads.Tamiko Porter, who operates a Montessori school serving some 75 students, said she was surprised to learn there was a dam upstream that could flood her school if it failed."Oh, God, please let it happen when my kids aren't here," Porter said.Norwood emergency management director Bernard Cooper said there is no imminent risk of dam failure."Yes, it needs work. The spillway should be rebuilt. Absolutely, no question," Cooper acknowledged. But "there is no money in the system for that."Concerns about inadequate dam spillways date back decades to when the Corps of Engineers undertook its first nationwide assessment of dams posing a high risk to life and property. From 1978 to 1981, the Corps inspected 8,818 dams. About one-third were deemed unsafe due to deficiencies, and about 80% of those cited inadequate spillway capacities.One of the dams cited for a "seriously inadequate" spillway in 1978 was Lake Sebago, located in a New York state park near the village of Sloatsburg. Forty years later, nothing has changed.A 2018 state inspection letter warned of "inadequate spillway capacity and dam stability" and asked for an improvement plan within 30 days. None was provided.The state dam safety office has no authority to force the state parks department to make repairs.To modify the Lake Sebago spillway, workers would have to rebuild a road and bridge that pass over the dam. The project could cost over 15 million, said Jim Hall, the recently retired executive director of the Palisades Interstate Park Commission, which manages multiple dams."That structure has been in place with the same spillway capacity for over probably 60 to 70 years and it hasn't been overtopped," Hall said. "Should it be improved to meet all codes? Yeah, that would be nice. Does it make it the highest priority for us to do in relation to other dam structures we have? Probably not."Cost Of Shoring Up DamsIn a 1982 report summarizing its nationwide dam assessment, the Corps of Engineers said most dam owners were unwilling to modify, repair or maintain the structures, and most states were unwilling to spend enough money for an effective dam safety program.Since then, every state but Alabama has created a dam safety program.But the Great Recession a decade ago forced many states to make widespread budget and personnel cuts. Since a low point in 2011, states' total spending on dam safety has grown by about one-third to nearly 59 million in the 2019 fiscal year while staffing levels have risen by about one-fifth, according to data collected by the Corps of Engineers.California, which runs the nation's largest dam safety program, accounts for much of that gain. It boosted its budget from 13 million to 20 million and the number of full-time staff from 63 to 77 following the failure of the Oroville dam spillway in 2017.The scare at Oroville, the nation's tallest dam, led to evacuation orders for nearly 200,000 people, although no one was injured and the dam ultimately held. An independent investigation cited "a long-term systemic failure " by regulators and the dam industry to recognize and address warning signs.California spent 1.1 billion repairing the Lake Oroville spillway, enacted new emergency plan requirements and launched a review of 93 other dams with similar spillways.In South Carolina, after more than 70 dams failed following heavy rains in 2015 and 2016, the state tripled the personnel in its dam safety program and ratcheted up spending from about 260,000 annually to more than 1 million.But some states have continued to pare back their dam safety programs. Thirteen states and Puerto Rico were spending less in 2019 than they did in 2011, and 11 states had fewer full-time positions in their programs.The Association of State Dam Safety Officials says almost every state faces a serious need to pump additional money and manpower into dam safety programs."If you don't have the staff to inspect a dam, or don't have the authority to do that, you don't know what the problems are," said the association's Ogden."If you are able to do the inspection but you can't follow up, and you have dam owners who don't have the resources to fix their dam, then ultimately you know what the problem is but you can't get it addressed," he added.Many states face a quandary when it comes to problematic private dams when they can't identify the owners. Rhode Island's two-person dam safety office last year listed 32 high- or significant-hazard dams with safety concerns whose owners were unknown."If we don't know the owner, then we can't take any action to order anybody to fix it," said David Chopy, chief of compliance and inspection for the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management.In some states, dams go uninspected because of exemptions in state law.A 2013 Texas law exempts all dams on private property with a capacity of less than 163 million gallons that are rated significant or low hazard and are located outside of city limits in any county with fewer than 350,000 people. As a result, about 45% of its roughly 7,200 dams are exempt from regulation.Missouri performs safety inspections on only about 650 of its more than 5,000 dams. That's because state law exempts all dams that are under 35 feet, used for agricultural purposes or subject to federal regulation.Former Missouri Gov. Matt Blunt attempted to significantly expand the number of dams under state supervision after the mountaintop Taum Sauk Reservoir collapsed in December 2005, injuring a state park superintendent's family. But the legislation failed after some rural landowners expressed concerns. Then the proposal quietly faded away as new officials took over."Maybe it's time to take a look at that again and make sure that our dams are safe," said Missouri state Rep. Tim Remole, who now leads the House committee overseeing dam safety.As in Kauai's case, Lake Dunlap Dam, northeast of San Antonio, remains largely unrepaired. The dam was the second hydroelectric facility along the Guadalupe River to fail within the past three years. The Guadalupe-Blanco River Authority responded with plans to drain a chain of four lakes because of concerns their similarly designed spillway gates also could fail.But after property owners sued, the river authority agreed in September to a temporary injunction delaying the plan for a year. That could allow time to find funding for the estimated 90 million to 210 million to repair the dams."This is something that communities and states all across the country are grappling with as we are reckoning with our aging infrastructure," said Tess Coody-Anders, a homeowner near Lake McQueeney, one of the dams slated to be drained."I hope that everyone will recognize that, like in our community, entire economies and ways of life have developed around what started out as a civil engineering project," she added. "And you can't take that away."

Water flows over the Lake Welch Dam in Harriman State Park near Stony Point. (AP Photo) AP analysis: Dams across New York pose potential threat By Associated Press New York State PUBLISHED 11:28 AM ET May. 05, 2022 PUBLISHED 11:28 AM EDT May. 05, 2022 SHARE Dozens of dams in poor condition across New York state are upstream from homes, highways or businesses, posing potential threats to people if they fail. An Associated Press analysis found 90 “high-hazard” dams in New York that also were rated in poor condition — a marked increase from several years ago largely driven by the state's push to rate more dams. A high-hazard designation does not mean a dam is in danger of failing, but that the loss of human life is likely if it does. Most of those dams are operated by state or local governments, including 11 dams within the state parks system. Twenty-five are privately owned. Deficiencies noted in the dams include cracks, seepage and inadequate spillway capacity, according to inspection reports obtained by the AP. In Harriman State Park, an inspection report last year noted “erosion and scouring” at the end of a concrete spillway outlet chute that could potentially compromise the First Reservoir Dam. While many of these dams are expected to perform adequately under normal conditions, the cost of failure could be catastrophic. In Ithaca, failure of the 60 Foot Dam during severe rains could add to existing flooding, leaving sections of the Finger Lakes city inundated with a peak of 2 to 15 feet (0.6 to 4.6 meters) of water. City officials said such a dam failure was unlikely, according to an emergency action plan. Ithaca’s Superintendent of Public Works Mike Thorne said the dam was built to century-old stability standards and now must meet stricter requirements. The city is working to get a grant to help fund needed work, he said. “We have been working with various consultants on the 60 Foot Dam and we do have rough plans in place for what needs to happen,” Thorne said. “The problem is it’s expensive.” State parks officials said they're addressing deficiencies in five priority dams. At Harriman State Park, construction on First Reservoir Dam is to begin next year with work on Lake Sebago Dam to start in 2024, according to park officials. The number of high-hazard dams in poor condition statewide is almost double the number from AP’s prior analysis three years ago. But the increase was driven primarily by previously unrated dams receiving a condition rating in recent years. State Department of Environmental Conservation officials said they have focused on rating more of the dams they regulate, increasing the portion with ratings to 87%, up from 49% in 2018. “Our staff immediately addresses any urgent conditions that are identified, remain on call every day of the year to respond to any potential concerns resulting from storms or other damaging impacts, and conduct diligent inspections of private, public, and state-regulated dams to help prevent issues before they occur,” the DEC said a prepared statement.

Brazilian mine tragedy will not be the last tailings dam disaster: Andy Home | ReutersDiscover Thomson ReutersDirectory of sitesLoginContactSupportfor-phone-onlyfor-tablet-portrait-upfor-tablet-landscape-upfor-desktop-upfor-wide-desktop-upCommodities NewsUpdated Brazilian mine tragedy will not be the last tailings dam disaster: Andy HomeBy Andy Home7 Min ReadLONDON (Reuters) - (The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters)FILE PHOTO: A view of a collapsed tailings dam owned by Brazilian mining company Vale SA, in Brumadinho, Brazil February 13, 2019. REUTERS/Washington AlvesThe collapse of Vale’s Brumadinho iron ore tailings dam in Brazil was both shocking and devastating in its impact. But it was not a one-off event.It was the 11th serious tailings dam failure in the last decade and such catastrophic events are becoming more frequent, according to researchers at World Mine Tailings Failures (WMTF).Indeed, the number of incidents is going to rise further, according to the U.S. not-for-profit organization that tracks all recorded tailings storage facility (TSF) failures.“Without major changes to law and regulation, and to industry practices, and without new technology that substantially reduces risk and increases loss control, our current prediction is for 19 very serious failures between 2018 and 2027.”A “very serious” failure is defined by how much waste material is released, how far it travels and how many fatalities result.It’s a terrible indictment of a global industry that is trying to shed its “dirty” image in response to consumer and investor pressure for “clean” materials.So what are tailings dams, why are they failing with increasing frequency and what can the industry do about it?(GRAPHIC: Brazilian Tailings Dam Collapse - tmsnrt.rs/2UYr4AC)WASTE DISPOSALA tailings dam is the most common waste disposal solution for mining companies, whether they’re extracting iron ore, gold or copper.Water is essential in the grinding and processing of mineral ore for the extraction of the contained metal, which means that the waste takes the form of a slurry of water and mineral particles.It is this slurry that is stored in a tailings dam and which can cause such devastation if the dam is breached.“Water will flow through and around buildings but liquefied tailings can destroy the structures,” notes a joint report published in 2006 by the International Commission on Large Dams (ICOLD) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP).“The volumes of mine waste greatly exceed the total volumes of materials handled by civil engineering throughout the world,” and some tailings dams “are probably the largest man-made structures on earth,” the report adds.The report’s title, “Tailings Dams: Risk of Dangerous Occurrences” tells you that even more than a decade ago there was rising concern about the rising number of dam failures.WHY DAMS FAILA comparison between dams built as water reservoirs and those built to hold mine waste is telling.Water dams, or embankment dams, tend not to break.“Embankment dams are prestigious structures used to profitably store water, whereas tailings dams are required for the storage of unwanted waste, desirably at minimum cost,” according to the ICOLD/UNEP report.More critically, “embankment dams are usually built to full height during one period of construction.” Tailings dams, by comparison “are built slowly over many years and conditions may also change with time,” meaning “supervision of their construction may become faulty.”A mine tailings dam is continuous work in progress, its size dependent on how long a mine operates and at what rate of throughput. Mines sometimes go inactive before resuming operations as the price of the mined metal fluctuates, complicating continuous dam management.One reason for the projected higher rate of “very serious” failure is simple mathematics. More mines are operating for longer, meaning ever growing amounts of tailings waste with greater potential devastation if the dams break.In terms of dam technology, the so-called “upstream” dam using tailings to construct the tailings dam, was already identified in the 2006 ICOLD/UNEP report as higher risk.It was precisely this type of “upstream” dam that caused such devastation in Brazil last month.There is a growing move away from such dam technology, particularly in mining areas prone to seismic activity or heavy rainfall.But there are still plenty of “upstream” dams in operation around the world, 88 in Brazil alone, according to that country’s mining agency.And using different technology doesn’t eliminate the risk of dam failure or less devastating leakage. Contamination of water supplies from leaking tailings dams is a source of friction between mining companies and local residents the world over.ECONOMIC DRIVERSWhile each tailings dam is almost by nature unique and technology can vary across the risk spectrum, there are two underlying economic drivers that apply to just about all of them.The first is the reduction in ore grades as mining companies have to work older deposits harder for the same amount of metal.The classic example here is copper. Global copper ore grades have declined from 2 percent in the first half of the 20th century to less than 1 percent in the last decade.Simply put, that means more waste to be stored in tailings dams per tonne of copper extracted and the resulting lower margins mean less money available for dam safety.The second driver is price.The “super-cycle” years of high metal prices pushed miners to maximize production, particularly at margin-challenged mines, where investment in safety came second to cash-flow generation.The subsequent years of lower prices not only discouraged such investment but led to major operators shedding marginal mines to less-qualified owners in deference to shareholder pressure.ZERO FAILURE OBJECTIVEThe call of bodies such as UNEP is for regulators, communities and miners to adopt a shared “zero-failure” approach to tailings dams.Evidently, dam design and regulatory oversight are critical components of such a policy.But, more fundamentally, to quote the official review of the Mount Polley dam failure in Canada in 2014, “safety attributes should be evaluated separately from economic considerations and cost should not be the determining factor” in tailings management.The mining industry, in other words, needs to rethink radically what it currently regards as worthless “waste” and to decommission the highest-risk dams, even if it is cost-negative.If it doesn’t, another tailings dam failure is simply a matter of time.For the world’s miners there is more than simple reputation at stake here.The Central American country of El Salvador made a little bit of history in March 2017, when it became the first country to ban all mining activity.The decision enjoyed massive popular support because of fears that a proposed new gold-silver mine would mean even worse water contamination in a country already struggling with the environmental legacy of previous mines.El Salvador could do with the revenue from mining. But given the choice, it chose water over gold.The mining industry has lost its right to operate in the country.If the industry doesn’t break the cycle of tailings dam failure, El Salvador may not be the last country to choose the health of its citizens over the health of its tax receipts.Editing by David EvansOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.AppsNewslettersAdvertise with UsAdvertising GuidelinesCookiesTerms of UsePrivacyDo Not Sell My Personal InformationAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

The river gauge at Pembina gave a reading of 51.5 feet Wednesday morning, which is more than 12 feet above flood stage and just 3.4 feet shy of the record crest set during the devastating floods of 1997. The river is forecast to continue rising to a crest of 53 feet this weekend, which would be the second highest crest ever measured in Pembina. Authorities said closed Highway 5 near Cavalier – located about 7 miles southwest of Pembina – because of "possible imminent rupture" of the Bourbanis Dam,. North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum activated the National Guard on Tuesday, and the Guard immediately responded with two Black Hawk helicopters helping place 119 one-ton sandbags in areas of most concern, including at the dam. "Crews will remain in place overnight to monitor Bourbanis Dam for any changes," emergency management officials announced Tuesday night. A massive effort to protect the Pembina included students filling 5,000 sandbags on Tuesday, with 2,000 more expected to be filled Wednesday. As of Tuesday, water was on the edge of Interstate 29 in Pembina in "a few small areas," officials said. Sign up: Subscribe to our BREAKING NEWS newslettersLevels at the Renwick Dam near Cavalier were dropping on Tuesday, though officials said "there is still potential for high flows from Bourbanis Dam resulting a rise in the levels at Renwick Dam."The town of Neche, which is located 7 miles west of Pembina and located along the Pembina River, was surrounded by water as of Tuesday. A command center in the town is monitoring the dike and had been successfully repairing breaches as they occurred, emergency management said. Fortunately, there is no rain in the forecast until Sunday or early next week. Tagsterms:Pembina NdRed River FloodingMinnesotaNeche NDND NewsCavalier NDNorth DakotaBy Joe NelsonMinnesota LifeAnimal Humane Society plans trailblazing new campusTake a look inside the plans for a first-of-its-kind adoption center and animal care campus.MN HealthMinnesota reports 'concerning level' of syphilis casesThe Minnesota Department of Health says most of the cases are being discovered in the northern part of the state.MN NewsAirport police intercept 5,600 fentanyl pills headed to St. CloudThree were arrested following a police raid in St. Cloud.MN BusinessKris Lindahl files trademark for 'iconic' arms out pose"The pose has become iconic," Lindahl said.MN CoronavirusMinnesota switches to weekly COVID updatesThe weekly updates will be provided on Thursdays.MN NewsMan shot inside Oakdale movie theater expected to surviveThe 23-year-old victim underwent surgery and is recovering at the hospital.MN HealthMinnesota confirms second case of monkeypox virusMore cases are expected in the coming days and weeks, the health department says.MN NewsDriver falls asleep, crashes through motel wall near DuluthAlcohol was not a factor in the crash.MN CoronavirusMinnesota's COVID-19 update for Wednesday, June 29One of the newly reported deaths was a person aged 15-19 from Yellow Medicine County.MN NewsDrone drops bag of candy near kids fishingA black SUV quickly left the area afterwards.TV, Movies and The ArtsAl Franken to bring comedy tour to MinneapolisAcme Comedy is hosting the former senator in late August.MN Music and RadioAlabama replaces Toby Keith as headliner at MN music festivalThe Lakefront Music Festival is set to take place in Prior Lake on July 8-9.MN NewsRain to soak flood-stricken parts of MN, ND through SundayAt a minimum, as the City of Grand Forks says, "The rain will slow down how fast the river goes down."MN NewsNorth Dakota's only abortion clinic relocating to MinnesotaA GoFundMe set up to help the clinic make the move to Minnesota has surpassed its 500,000 goal.MN NewsNational Guard activated as major flooding hits Grand Forks, CrookstonThe Minnesota National Guard has been activated.MN NewsWest Fargo police officer suffers heart attack after arresting suspectsThe officer collapsed and was unresponsive at the jail.MN NewsFreeways shut down as North Dakota gets slammed by blizzardParts of northwest Minnesota are also under the gun Sunday.MN NewsFlood threat evacuates 1,300 in NE North DakotaMN NewsMinnesota bracing for possible significant spring floodingThe best-case scenario will be little snow and a stretch of dry, warm conditions.MN NewsNorth Dakota looks like a wasteland in wake of powerful blizzardInterstates and highways are littered with buried vehicles.DONTCHA KNOW?You Can Get BMTN Special Offers!Get Our NewsletterAbout UsMeet the TeamAdvertise With UsJobsContestsContact UsPlatform Privacy© 2022 Bring Me The News LLCCLOSECLOSECLOSECLOSE

Now Brazil is casting an anxious eye on dozens of dams like it. FEB. 9, 2019 Ler em português AP By BRUMADINHO, Brazil — Luiz de Castro was installing lamps at a mining complex in Brazil late last month when a loud blast split the air. He figured it was just a truck tire popping, but a friend knew better. “No, it’s not that!” the friend said. “Run!” Dashing up a staircase, caked in mud and pelted by flying rocks, Mr. Castro clambered to safety. But as he watched, a wall of mud unleashed by the collapse of a mining dam swallowed his co-workers, he said. Tiago, George, Icaro — they and at least 154 others, all buried alive. The deluge of toxic mud stretched for five miles, crushing homes, offices and people — a tragedy, but hardly a surprise, experts say. This article is by Shasta Darlington, James Glanz, Manuela Andreoni, Matthew Bloch, Sergio Peçanha, Anjali Singhvi and Troy Griggs. There are 87 mining dams in Brazil built like the one that failed — enormous reservoirs of mining waste held back by little more than walls of sand and silt. And all but four of the dams have been rated by the government as equally vulnerable, or worse. Even more alarming, at least 27 sit directly uphill from cities or towns, with more than 100,000 people living in especially risky areas if the dams failed, an estimate by The New York Times found. In the disaster last month, all the elements for catastrophe were there: A bare-bones reservoir of mining waste built on the cheap, sitting above a large town nestled underneath. Overlooked warnings of structural problems that could lead to a collapse. Monitoring equipment that had stopped working. And perhaps above all, a country where a powerful mining industry has been free to act more or less unchecked. The threat of poorly constructed mining dams in Brazil goes far beyond one company. The latest deadly failure — the second in Brazil in three years — has made it clear that neither the mining industry nor regulators have the situation under control. Collapsed dam Flow of mud Mine headquarters Farmland Hotel Residential area Approx. 5 miles from dam Paraopeba River Collapsed dam Flow of mud Mine headquarters Hotel Farmland Residential area Approx. 5 miles from dam Paraopeba River Vale S.A., the world’s largest iron ore producer, says it will close all 10 of its dams in Brazil with a design similar to the one it ran in the town, Brumadinho. Still, the company, which bought the mining complex in 2001, defended its management of the dam, which had been sitting there, inactive, since 2016. “The dam had a safety factor in accordance with the world’s best practices,” Vale said in a statement. The structure, it said, had been inspected regularly, ​and the reports “attest to the physical and hydraulic safety of the dam.” But questions about the safety of the dam had been brushed aside for years. Despite them, the company had managed to get its plan to expand the mining complex in Brumadinho fast-tracked for approval by local officials. “When you have this sort of structure upstream of a population center, that sends up all sorts of red flags,” said William F. Marcuson III, a former president of the American Society of Civil Engineers.

Dams like the one that collapsed in Brumadinho are, in essence, lakes of thick, semi-hardened mud consisting of water and the solid byproducts of ore mining, which are known as tailings. Antonio Lacerda/EPA, via Shutterstock Like any dam, they can fail in a number of unsurprising ways. They can overtop if filled too quickly. They can spring a leak, or sustain damage in an earthquake. Or they can fall victim to sloppy construction or maintenance. But they are not like any dam. Indeed, the structure at Brumadinho strained the very definition of “dam.” It had no separate concrete or metal wall to hold back its contents. Instead, the structure, known as an upstream tailings dam, relied on the lake of mud to remain solid enough to contain itself. 1 The Brumadinho dam was born, its plans show, as a relatively modest mound of compacted material that acted like a dike. Starter dike is made of compacted dirt. Tailings 2 When the dam was opened for business, waste from the mine was piped in behind the starter dike and subsequent dikes. The tailings are mixed with water and piped into the dam area. New dikes are built on top of solidified mud tailings as the dam grows. 3 As the mud lake grew, new dikes were built upstream to hold it. Several dikes are made of compacted tailings. Water table Engineers added a setback to address problems with seepage in the lower parts of the dam. High water pressure could potentially breach the dam and help produce liquefaction.

SECTIONS OF THE DAM The New York Times | Note: Diagram is based on a 2010 master’s thesis by Washington Pirete and a 2018 report by Tüv Süd. “Basically they are like landfills, but wet landfills,” said Gregory B. Baecher, a member of the National Academy of Engineering and a professor at the University of Maryland. The dams’ unique construction makes them vulnerable to a bizarre and potentially devastating process called liquefaction. When that happens, a solid material seemingly resting safely in place can abruptly become a murky liquid, flowing downhill and destroying nearly everything in its path. Even a subtle change, like an increase in water content because of especially heavy rains, say, or poor management, can create enough internal pressure to push apart the solid tailings and liquefy the mud. The people of Brumadinho know all too well what can happen next. “The forces are absolutely phenomenal,” said Dirk Van Zyl, a professor of mining engineering at the University of British Columbia, who investigated a 2014 collapse of a tailings dam in Canada. “You really have to see it to understand.” A video of the Brumadinho collapse makes clear that the mud behind the dam did liquefy, experts who have seen it said. What is not clear is whether liquefaction caused the collapse, or followed it. The video appears to show where the dam failure began. B A C Areas where the dam appears to have collapsed first “It started as a pinpoint,” said Mr. Marcuson, the former engineering society president, “and maybe in one second it looked like a whole patch down there.” Very rapidly, he said, “the dam fails and the tailings pour out and the dam goes to hell in a matter of seconds. And the dam just crumbles up.” N TOP VIEW OF THE DAM The mud tailings started to liquefy and flow down the valley. 3 Extent of the mudflow B Dam face Entire face of the dam started to collapse 2 C A Dam started to collapse in these areas at the lower and top dikes 1 B A C Areas where the dam appears to have collapsed first “It started as a pinpoint,” said Mr. Marcuson, the former engineering society president, “and maybe in one second it looked like a whole patch down there.” Very rapidly, he said, “the dam fails and the tailings pour out and the dam goes to hell in a matter of seconds.

Mr. Van Zyl said: “Ultimately everything liquefies and it’s gone. It’s pretty darn bad.” Many engineers cautioned that it was too soon to draw firm conclusions about what precisely went wrong with the structure in Brumadinho, called Dam I of the Córrego do Feijão Mine. And they said it was possible to build upstream tailings dams safely. “There’s nothing blatantly wrong with this method of construction,” said W. Allen Marr, founder and chief executive of Geocomp, based in Boston, and a member of the national academy. When the structures fail, Mr. Marr said, “it’s usually a combination of several things that should have been done but don’t get done.” In 2010, Washington Pirete, whose LinkedIn profile and a professional publication list him as a longtime Vale employee, wrote a master’s thesis focused on the dam at Brumadinho. Mr. Pirete concluded that the risks of liquefaction were low to moderate, but several engineers say now that his analysis, if anything, cast doubt on the safety of the dam. Douglas Magno/Agence France-Presse -- Getty Images Mr. Marr said that Mr. Pirete’s safety calculations “raise questions about the stability of the dam.” Mr. Van Zyl said that if he had calculated the safety margins Mr. Pirete found for the dam, “I wouldn’t sleep well.” He said his first reaction on seeing the thin margins was that the dam “should have failed earlier, almost.” Mr. Pirete did not respond to several requests for comment. The thesis describes a method of construction, which began in 1976, that is in many ways routine for upstream dams. A so-called starter dike was built across the valley above Brumadinho, and the mining company piped waste behind it. When the waste neared the top of the dike, the company built another slightly uphill — hence the name upstream construction. The second dike sat directly on the hardened mud. Over the decades, a towering structure rose over the mining complex, its integrity dependent entirely on the solidity of the mud. A closer look at Mr. Pirete’s figures, some of which were scarcely above the collapse threshold, left some engineers questioning how Mr. Pirete could have considered the dam safe. “That’s way too close to the margin,” Mr. Baecher said. Last year, a German company hired by Vale took its own look at the dam and calculated higher stability factors than Mr. Pirete did — but it did raise safety concerns. The company Tüv Süd found blocked drainage pipes and cracks, and made note of a small wooden structure that had been erected to stop part of the dam from slumping. The company also found water visibly seeping from at least one area, and said there was a risk of liquefaction. To reduce the risk of triggering a collapse through vibrations, they advised Vale to avoid letting heavy equipment onto the dam or allowing detonations nearby. They also advised work to keep the water level from rising. A Looming Threat Two weeks after the Brumadinho tragedy, sirens went off in the middle of the night 76 miles away, in the town of Barão de Cocais. “Attention! This is a real dam break emergency,” loudspeakers blasted. “Abandon your homes immediately.” The alarms wreaked havoc as nearly 500 people were ordered to evacuate. Vale, which owns the mining complex in Barão de Cocais, called it a “preventive measure,” explaining it had initiated its emergency plan after the consulting firm Walm refused to attest to the dam’s stability. “We hope it doesn’t burst, but unlike many cities we had time to act,” said Décio dos Santos, the town mayor. “We didn’t know the dam was dangerous.” The true risk of dams in Brazil — and elsewhere — is largely unknown. Just as in Brumadinho, the dams above the now evacuated areas of Barão de Cocais and another town, Itatiaiuçu, are upstream dams. There are a total of 87 upstream dams throughout Brazil, and all but four have the same safety rating as the collapsed structure — or worse — according to government records.

Authorities and representatives of the ArcelorMittal mining company went door to door in one neighborhood, ordering some 200 people to evacuate. Here, too, the company said it had initiated its emergency plan after auditors adopted “a more conservative methodology” and refused to attest to the stability of a nearby dam — although the conditions themselves were unchanged. A Company Town Says ‘Enough’ When the dam collapsed at the Córrego de Feijão mine shortly after noon, 11.7 million cubic meters of mining waste — enough to fill almost 5,000 Olympic swimming pools — descended toward the town below. As it did, it slammed into a company cafeteria, where there were a couple of hundred employees. It took rescue workers days to reach them. Antonio Lacerda/EPA, via Shutterstock Vale is the main source of income for the 37,000 people living in Brumadinho, but as the death toll rose, public anger boiled over at the company. Even run-of-the-mill activities became daunting, with a mass of thick brown sludge now cutting through the town. Two days after the dam collapse, Mayor Avimar Barcelos described Vale as “incompetent and reckless.” Vale workers, once proud, felt subdued. One said he no longer felt comfortable wearing his uniform on the street. “I’d be lynched,” he said. At the entrance to town, a monument bore a scribbled accusation: “Murderous Vale!!!” AP The company says it is still investigating what caused the rupture and insists there were no warning signs. The dam had been inactive for almost three years, according to Vale, and had been certified as stable in September, despite warnings in a 2015 environmental impact study that some of the monitoring instruments were faulty. Three years ago, a similar dam burst in the city of Mariana, 75 miles away, killing 19 people and unleashing one of the worst environmental disasters in Brazilian history. That dam was jointly owned by Vale and the Anglo-Australian mining company BHP. After the Mariana collapse, officials vowed to adopt rigorous safety protocols. That never happened. In Brazil, given the dearth of government inspectors, companies are allowed to self-regulate, hiring independent auditors to verify dam safety through regular inspections and an analysis of written records — all provided by the company. Experts say that creates a conflict of interest. “You can’t have the person doing the inspection getting paid by the company he is inspecting,” said Evandro Moraes da Gama, a professor of engineering at the Federal University of Minas Gerais who specializes in mining waste. Four days after the Brumadinho dam burst, the police arrested the outside inspectors who had attested to its stability, along with three Vale employees responsible for safety and environmental licensing. A judge later ordered them released. “They’re taking it out on the inspectors, arresting them, but it’s the system that’s flawed,” Mr. Gama said. Many residents of Brumadinho believe that the failure of the company’s warning system cost many lives. In a statement, Vale said the “speed at which the event occurred made it impossible to trigger the sirens.” Mr. Castro, the Vale employee who escaped the deluge, said, “If the alarm had sounded, the environmental tragedy would still happen, but no one would have died.” Jefferson Ferreira dos Passos, whose sister worked at an inn downhill from the dam, said that when he heard it had burst, he immediately called her. When she didn’t answer, Mr. Passos ran four miles to the site — only to find an expanse of mud. He and another man started carrying survivors out of the sludge. When they found a woman clinging to a tree trunk with her legs broken, they waited by her side until a helicopter airlifted her out. TV Record, via AP He never found his sister. Hooked on Mining The first Portuguese explorers came searching for gold and diamonds in the state of Minas Gerais, whose name means “general mines.” It remains the hub of Brazil’s mining industry, producing 53 percent of the country’s output, with more mines and tailings dams than any other Brazilian state. Here, critics say, the laws are written by the mining companies, not for them. Last December, an extraordinary meeting of the state council on mining regulations was called to vote on a proposal by Vale to expand operations at Córrego de Feijão and another mine. The proposal had been declared a “priority” by the state. Vale bought the mining complex in 2001. Antonio Lacerda/EPA, via Shutterstock Maria Teresa Corujo, an activist who represents the community vote on the council, angrily pointed out that council members had been given just four business days to pore over thousands of documents. “The environmental management of our state continues to be focused on the G.D.P. index, on mining interests,” she said, according to minutes of the meeting that were sent to The Times. “This is destroying Minas Gerais.” Júlio Cesar Dutra Grillo, the state representative from the federal environmental protection agency, warned the council that the dams were not risk free. “Any negligence on the part of those conducting risk management, and they rupture,” he said. The proposal passed with one dissenting vote, from Ms. Corujo, and an abstention by Mr. Grillo. The board's decision came despite growing concern about accidents after the Mariana dam collapse. In public hearings, activists in Brumadinho would try to convince residents that tourism, not mining, was the city’s path forward. But tourism is not what keeps the city spinning. Mining started here in the 1950s and many communities in the city were created by its workers. Fernando Coelho, 35, was born in a small community inside the Córrego do Feijão mining compound. “My umbilical cord is buried there,” he said. Mr. Coelho started working there alongside his father, Olavo Coelho, when he was 19, but was at home after a night shift on the day the dam broke. He knew his father would be having lunch at the cafeteria and rushed to his car. When he got there, all he found was mud. Mr. Coelho said he was desperately sad — but angry, too. Months before the collapse, his father had been called in to fix a leak. Ever since then, according to his son, he had been saying the dam was not safe. “He warned the dam could burst,” he said. “But he isn’t the one making decisions.” Mr. Coelho said he told the prosecutors in charge of the investigation what his father had told him. Three other workers also told The Times they were aware of leaks. But Mr. Coelho said that despite his father’s warnings, he had never worried the dam would break. His whole life, after all, revolved around the mining complex. He feels differently now. “I won’t ever go back,” he said. “It killed my father.” Before the dam collapsed After the collapse Mud flow Before the dam collapsed After the collapse Mud flow Before After Flow Before the dam collapsed After the collapse Mud flow The New York Times | Satellite imagery via DigitalGlobe In the days after the rupture, Vale said it would give the families of each victim 100,000 reais, or 27,000, independent of any legal settlements. State and national governments quickly called for stricter regulations, but, as experts point out, the outrage after the Mariana dam collapse did little to improve the regulatory framework. “After Mariana, the system just got more flexible, facilitating the traffic of influence inside the licensing system,” said Klemens Laschefski, a Federal University of Minas Gerais professor who participates in the council meetings. Douglas Magno/Agence France-Presse -- Getty Images “I’ve been to 40 meetings on priority projects — not one was rejected,” he said. Ademir Caricati, a community leader in a neighborhood where roughly 40 houses were destroyed, said that Vale officials told residents last year that the dam posed little danger. The officials even offered an odd sort of reassurance, pointing out that the mine’s administrative offices were right below the dam. “We would be the first to die,” one said.

Michigan filed a lawsuit this week against Boyce Hydro seeking compensation, civil fines and damages that the state contends are the responsibility of the dam owner. The suit was filed by the attorney general’s office on behalf of the Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy, and the Department of Natural Resources. “The suit seeks to hold the dam owners accountable for the damage they caused and recoup the money the taxpayers have spent responding to the emergency created by this devastating flood,” attorney general Dana Nessel said in a press release. Nessel sought to absolve the state of any responsibility for the dam failure in a media briefing announcing the lawsuit. The dam’s “failure is not the result of any action or inaction by the state of Michigan,” according to Nessel, who said legal responsibility rested solely with the dam’s owner. Homeowners impacted by the failure have filed lawsuits against EGLE, which has regulatory responsibility over dams and has known of the severity of its problems since 2018. EGLE director Liesl Clark characterized the dam’s history as “complicated” and said the agency inherited responsibility for it in September 2018 when the responsible federal agency, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, revoked its license and turned it over to EGLE. The dam had a long history of noncompliance according to FERC records. EGLE had been working with a group of homeowners who would assume responsibility for the dam and modernize it but “tragically, it was not soon enough,” according to Clark who also said the dam’s owner could have brought the dam into compliance anytime in the previous 15 years. Attempts to secure a comment from Boyce Hydro were not successful. High hazard, poor condition The primary failure occurred at the Edenville Dam, which was rated as a high hazard dam in poor condition by the state’s Dam Safety Unit. A dam’s hazard rating is determined by its potential downstream impact on life and property in the event of a failure, not its condition, dam safety staff said in a media briefing last week. A “poor” rating indicates a safety deficiency is recognized and remedial action or further investigation is warranted. The most severe rating is “unsatisfactory” which requires immediate or emergency action. When dams are out of compliance EGLE will take enforcement action when necessary, according to the dam safety staff, who said the goal is to “work with dam owners and bring them back into compliance.” “EGLE had a path forward that would have Boyce Hydro out of the picture very soon,” communications manager Hugh McDiarmid told Great Lakes Now. That “would have resulted in faster, better dam upgrades than any enforcement action,” McDiarmid said. Veteran Michigan and Great Lakes policy adviser Dave Dempsey is skeptical. “That’s the same policy that didn’t work at the federal level for decades until we passed the Clean Air and Water Acts,” Dempsey told Great Lakes Now. “This is what happens when environmental regulators try to work with a party to achieve compliance. It’s time for regulators like EGLE to enforce the law and protect the environment,” he said. EGLE’s Dam Safety Unit is a staff of two and one supervisor, and is responsible for over a thousand dams scattered around the state, according to spokesperson Nick Assendelft, who said the agency is “confident in the commitment and competence” of the unit. After the May dam failure, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer directed EGLE to review dam safety in the state. Critics have questioned the decision of having EGLE investigate itself given the agency’s potential liability based on pending lawsuits.

August 6, 2014 by Ed Schoenfeld, CoastAlaska News Share:Muddy water from the breached Mount Polley Mine tailings dam floods a downstream creek and road Monday. Fishing and environmental groups say the same could happen at new B.C. mines near the Southeast border. (Photo courtesy Cariboo Regional District Emergency Operations Centre) A tailings dam failure at a British Columbia copper and gold mine could threaten Southeast Alaska salmon fisheries. That’s according to critics, who say similar dams closer to the border could suffer the same fate, polluting Alaska waters. https://media.ktoo.org/2014/08/05DamBreaks.mp3 Monday morning’s dam break took place at the Mount Polley Mine, about 400 miles southeast of Ketchikan. Scroll down or click here for a video showing the damage. Observers estimate enough water, mud and rock to fill 2,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools escaped. Emergency officials warned downstream residents against drinking from affected waterways. That includes salmon-rich tributaries of the Fraser River, which empties into the Pacific Ocean at Vancouver, B.C. Brian Lynch of the Petersburg Vessel Owners Association says some of those fish swim north. “The United States has a harvest-sharing arrangement for Fraser sockeye and pink salmon through provisions of the Pacific Salmon Treaty. So any problem associated with salmon production on the Fraser will affect U.S. fishermen,” he says. Imperial Metals, the Mount Polley Mine’s owners, did not respond to a request for comment. That’s been the case with requests on other issues too. The corporate website says the mine is not operating and they don’t know how long repairs will take. A half-dozen or so similar mines are planned for northwest British Columbia, closer to the Alaska border. This aerial image from a British Columbia emergency office video shows the Mount Polley dam break and some of the damage downstream. Guy Archibald of the Southeast Alaska Conservation Council says they all plan to store tailings, which contain acidic rock and toxic metals, behind dams similar to the one that broke. “They’re all basically the same systems. They have to comply with the same regulations and design criteria,” he says. Archibald and Lynch are especially concerned about the Kerr-Sulphurets-Mitchell project, under development about 20 miles from the Alaska border. KSM will store tailings behind dams upstream from the Nass River, which ends just south of Alaska’s border with British Columbia. Environmental Affairs Vice President Brent Murphy says it’s not the same as the Mount Polley dam. “The design of the tailings management facility is such that water will not be standing up against the crest of the dam. Any ponds will be at least kilometers away from the crest of the dams,” he says. The Mount Polley break may have been caused by heavy rainfall and increased production added pressure to the dam. The KSM also plans a water treatment storage dam upstream from the Unuk River, which enters the ocean northeast of Ketchikan. It would be part of a system treating acidic water from mine pits and tunnels. Murphy says it’s designed to spill extra water rather than hold it beyond capacity. “That contact water would have characteristics very similar to the water that is currently flowing naturally within the Suphurets-Unuk river system,” he says. KSM’s dam plans have been OK’d by Canadian provincial and federal officials. Murphy says they also passed muster with independent engineers. Public comments on provincial environmental approval are being taken through Aug. 20. Lynch of the Petersburg Vessel Owners Association says the Mount Polley dam had the same approval. “This was not only obviously a tailings dam failure but it appears to be a regulatory oversight failure as well. And that’s what we want to prevent on any mines going into the transboundary systems,” he says. The Mount Polley mine owner, Vancouver-based Imperial Metals, plans to open the Red Chris Mine, in the Stikine River watershed this fall. Like Mount Polley and KSM, it’s an open-pit copper and gold mine. Share this story: Subscribe Get notifications about news related to the topics you care about. You can unsubscribe anytime.

Lakes were left dry while homes were underwater.More than 10,000 people had to evacuate. While no lives were lost, more than 2,000 homes were damaged or destroyed. Roads, bridges and businesses that stood in the way of the floodwaters were also damaged.The waters have subsided, and what’s left are lawsuits and questions. The biggest one: Who is responsible?Below is a list of key events preceding and following the dam’s failure:1925: The 6,600-foot Edenville Dam is built.June 2004: Wolverine Power Corporation transfers licenses for the Sanford, Edenville, Secord and Smallwood dams to Synex Michigan, LLC, later named Boyce Hydro. The Edenville and Sanford dams would later both fail during heavy rains in May 2020.December 2005 - October 2015:The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) meets with Boyce Hydro multiple times to work out a plan for various repairs. It also issues Boyce Hydro numerous violations including:December 13-16, 2005: FERC says its staff met with Boyce Hydro to work on increasing the spillway capacity to meet the probable maximum flood requirements.May 22-23, 2007: FERC says its staff met with Boyce Hydro to work on increasing the spillway capacity to meet the probable maximum flood requirements.July 9-11, 2007: FERC says its staff met with Boyce Hydro to work on increasing the spillway capacity to meet the probable maximum flood requirements.March 19-20, 2008: FERC says its staff met with Boyce Hydro to work on increasing the spillway capacity to meet the probable maximum flood requirements.February 4-5, 2009: FERC says its staff met with Boyce Hydro to work on increasing the spillway capacity to meet the probable maximum flood requirements.February 9, 2009: FERC sends Boyce Hydro a letter accepting their proposal to make repairs and upgrades to the Edenville Dam spillway over the course of three years, starting in 2010. The FERC says Boyce Hydro did not perform the repairs and upgrades.September 13, 2010: FREC sends Boyce Hydro, LLC a Violation Notice Request for Information about the construction of fishing piers, filling and dredging bottomlands, dredging, filling and draining wetlands, and grading in the floodplain.January 13, 2011: FREC sends Boyce Hydro, LLC a Second Violation Notice Request for Information.August 22, 2012: FREC issues violation notice to Boyce Hydro for failing to apply for Notice of Coverage. A Notice of Coverage is a type of Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control permit. It’s needed before a property owner can move change the landscape to control sedimentation runoff or impacts to wetlands.March 6, 2013: FREC sends another violation notice to Boyce Hydro for failing to apply for Notice of CoverageSeptember - November 2013: FREC sends Boyce Hydro a series of letters regarding issues with the Edenville Dam. Boyce Hydro then proposes to construct two auxiliary spillways, one in 2014 and one in 2015, but the work is never completed, according to FREC documents.July 7, 2015: FREC sends Boyce Hydro LLC another violation notice, this time for unauthorized dredging and filling in the floodplain and on bottomlands; failure to implement adequate soil erosion measures resulting in unauthorized discharge; and dredging, filling and draining of wetlands. DEQ offers Boyce Hydro an Administrative Consent Agreement that would include restoration of the dam.October 27, 2015: FREC issues Boyce Hydro a violation notice for failure to apply for Notice of Coverage.January 2011: Boyce Hydro owner Lee Mueller publicly states that the company will not pay for an 83,000 repair project on the Sanford Lake Dam. He argued that it is the responsibility of the property owners and businesses that benefit from the dam to make the repairs.June 15, 2017: The FERC issues Boyce Hydro a compliance order requiring them to fix the Edenville Dam’s insufficient spillway capacity. According to the order, “The licensee has shown a pattern of delay and indifference to the potential consequences of this situation. A situation that mist be remedied in order to protect life, limb, and property.”November 20, 2017: FERC orders Boyce Hydro to cease operations for allegedly violating the Federal Power Act and the June 15 compliance order.2018: The Michigan Infrastructure Report Card, assessed by the American Society of Civil Engineers, gives Michigan’s dams a C- grade. The report cites the need for more than 225 million to take care of the state’s 2,521 dams. 271 of those dams are over 100 years old. 12-percent of Michigan dams have a “high” or “significant” hazard potential rating. 67 percent of the state’s dams are past their 50-year design life.September 10, 2018: FREC revokes the Edenville Dam license as a hydroelectric generating facility. Meaning it can no longer use the dam to generate power. Once it did this, jurisdiction over the dam now fell on EGLE. The FREC sites continued lack of compliance with repair requests and failing to meet safety standards.September 2018: Boyce Hydro attempts to fight the FREC’s revocation of its license in court. In an email to MLive, Boyce Hydro owner Lee Mueller said the “problem behind the problem” of noncompliance is because of the economic circumstances and that Boyce Hydro “simply has not had the financial ability in the last eight years” to pay for the required Probable Maximum Flood mitigation construction limitations with Consumers Energy under the State of Michigan’s energy policies and regulatory structure.”October 2018: DEQ accuses Boyce Hydro, LLC of conducting a major drawdown of Wixom Lake without getting the proper permits. Boyce Hydro says it opened the gates as a preemptive safety measure to ensure dam safety during winter conditions. But the state says the drawdown was intended by Boyce Hydro to avoid paying for winter ice build up maintenance, not as a measure of downstream safety concern.October 2018: EGLE’s inspection of the Edenville Dam rates it as “fair,” despite FREC revoking Boyce Hydro’s license as a hydroelectric generating facility a month earlier.January 4, 2019: Boyce Hydro provides the state with a signed letter from their engineers stating that the dam did meet spillway capacity requirements.Spring 2019: Boyce Hydro agrees to raise the water levels to its normal summer level. It said in a later press release that it did so following pressure from shoreline residents of Wixom Lake, EGLE and Michigan Department of Natural Resources.April 24, 2019: Four Lakes Task Force (FLTF) and Boyce Trusts announce that they’ve reached a tentative agreement for FLTF to buy Wixom, Sanford, Secord and Smallwood Dams and lake bottoms for 9.4 million. The agreement also calls for Boyce Trusts or FLTF to make repairs and upgrades on all the dams by the end of 2023.June 2019: Edenville Dam inspection, done by the Spicer Group, begins on behalf of the Four Lakes Task Force.September 25, 2019: Boyce Hydro applies for a permit from EGLE to lower the water levels of Wixom Lake by approximately 8 feet.November 12, 2019: Boyce Hydro begins the drawdown without having received the permit it had applied for.November 25, 2019: EGLE’s Water Resources Division and the Michigan DNR deny Boyce Hydro’s permit. In a letter to Boyce Hydro owner, Lee Mueller, the state sites concerns about potential ecological effects.February 12, 2020: EGLE issues a permit to Boyce Hydro for specific repairs: rehabilitate deteriorated concrete and steel reinforcement at the spillway piers and pier noses of the Tittabawassee and Tobacco spillways, put approximately 12 cubic yards of new concrete fill in approximately 372 square feet of repair areas, install new hoist connection plates at all six spillway gates. The permit does not authorize any drawdown or refilling of the Wixom Lake Impoundment. The permit makes note that EGLE had previously found Boyce Hydro in violation of the Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Act (NREPA) for using the dam to lower the Wixom Lake Impoundment below its authorized winter level without a permit.March 2020: The Four Lakes Task Force inspection is complete, but the report is not finished.April 29, 2020: Boyce Hydro sues the state in Grand Rapids federal court “arguing the state lacks scientific validation for its endangered species concerns and should allow drawdowns.”May 1, 2020: Attorney General’s Office files a lawsuit against Boyce Hydro in Ingham County Circuit Court. It accuses Boyce Hydro of dramatically lowering the water levels of Wixom Lake in 2018 and 2019, destroying thousands of freshwater mussels. It also claims the alleged drawdowns dewatered the wetlands that depend on Wixom Lake and damaged other natural resources.May 15, 2020: Boyce Hydro says it began lowering the water levels in the impoundments behind the Secord, Smallwood, Edenville and Sanford dams in anticipation of incoming major storms.May 17, 2020: Storms bring heavy rainfall across the lower peninsula. The heaviest rain fell in the northeast and north-central part of Lower Michigan. Gladwin, a city about 25 miles north of Edenville saw 4.13 inches of rainfall by May 19.12:22 a.m. May 19, 2020: Midland County Central Dispatch issues an alert telling residents in Edenvile Township to leave their homes due to an “imminent dam failure” at the Edenville Dam. Those that live along Sanford Lake and Wixom Lake were told to vacate their homes and go to shelters.5:00 a.m. May 19, 2020: The Tittabawasse River reaches 26.5 feet high.

Emergency text goes out: “MIDLAND CITY RESIDENTS WEST OF EASTMAN SOUTH OF US-10 NEED TO EVACUATE DUE TO DAM COLLAPSE.” The initial dam breach causes the Sanford Dam to flow over and the Tittabawassee River to overflow its 24-foot flood stage.Aprox. 8:00 p.m. May 19, 2020: The M-30 bridge in Wixom Lake collapses while residents begin arriving at Midland High School after being evacuated from their homes.May 19, 2020: Governor Gretchen Whitmer declares a state of emergency for the city of Midland and Midland County due to severe flooding.Aprox. 4:00 a.m. May 20, 2020: National Guard units from Bay City, Saginaw, Port Huron, and other areas comprising about 130 soldiers, arrive in affected areas and begin missions.6:35 a.m. May 20, 2020: The Poseyville dike breaks and Midland County Central Dispatch sends out an alert urging residents on Ashby between Poseyville and Patterson roads to evacuate.7:00 a.m. May 20, 2020: National Weather Service says the flood stage is over 34 feet and rising.June 2, 2020: Lawsuits against Boyce Hydro begin to pile up. Two class action lawsuits against Boyce Hydro and owner Lee Mueller are filed in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District. The residents want punitive damages for personal an emotional injuries, as well as property and economic damage.June 1, 2020: The Congressional Committee on Energy and Commerce opens an inquiry into what caused the Edenville Dam to fail by sending EGLE director Liesl Clark a letter requesting responses to questions about the state’s oversight of the dam.June 9, 2020: State files lawsuit in Ingham County Circuit Court against Boyce Hydro seeking damages as a result of the dam failure. Boyce Hydro claims the state pressured it to keep elevated water levels on Wixom Lake despite concerns about the lake’s ability to handle flooding.June 10, 2020: EGLE announces during a joint state Senate committee hearing that it had begun the process of hiring a third-party investigator to look into the Edenville Dam failure.June 11, 2020: State releases Edenville Dam inspection report done by the Spicer Group. The dam was inspected for the Four Lakes Task Force from June 2019 to March 2020. The report finds that the dam wasn’t capable of meeting state capacity standards at the time of its collapse. It ranks the dam as “fair to poor” condition.June 15, 2020: Governor Gretchen Whitmer sends letter to President Donald Trump asking him to declare mid-Michigan floods a “major disaster.” In a news release, Whitmer says the flooding has cost residents more than 190 million in losses and 55 million in response costs and public infrastructure damage.June 16, 2020: A federal judge orders Boyce Hydro owner, Lee Mueller, to hire an engineer to perform an inspection of the site and “immediately determine whether the risk posed by the Tobacco River side of the Edenville Dam is substantial enough that immediate actions should be taken to mitigate the risk to public safety, natural resources, and public transportation and what that action should be.”June 17, 2020: State and federal regulators agree on a six-person team of engineers to lead an investigation into the Edenville and Sanford dam failures.June 23, 2020: State lawmakers hold a joint committee meeting with three officials from the FERC. State Senators criticized the federal regulating body for saying it didn’t levy fines against Boyce Hydro for failure to make repairs because Boyce Hydro claimed to be unable to afford the repairs.July 28, 2020: The state Senate Energy and Technology and Senate Environmental Quality committees meet with the president of the Four Lakes Task Force board and principal engineer with the Spicer Group. The pair estimated that it would take around 340 million to repair the dam infrastructure and surrounding areas.July 30, 2020: State announces that it is hiring a third dam safety inspector as part of its mission to increase dam safety in the state. EGLE also announces there will be a review of the state’s dam safety operations, performed by the Association of State Dam Safety Officials.July 31, 2020: Amidst a sea of lawsuits, Boyce Hydro. LLC and Boyce Hydro Power, LLC file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.Aug. 11, 2020: Residents and commercial property owners file a lawsuit in the Michigan Courts of Claims against EGLE, and the Michigan Department of Natural Resources (DNR) for “their failure to properly regulate and supervise the Edenville and Sanford dams, which ultimately led to the severe flood damage sustained by nearly 300 clients.”More From MLive:State worried about safety at remaining Edenville Dam portionEdenville Dam owner files for bankruptcyRural store tries to hang on after flood washes out bridges and flow of customers to EdenvilleSix-person engineering team to probe Edenville, Sanford dam failuresNote to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission.DisclaimerRegistration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement, Privacy Policy and Cookie Statement, and Your California Privacy Rights (User Agreement updated 1/1/21.

Continue BHP and Vale reach final settlement in Brazil over dam failure Cecilia Jamasmie | October 3, 2018 | 3:51 am Australia Latin America Iron Ore Samarco’s dam burst killed 19 people, wiped out several towns and polluted rivers. (Image by Romerito Pontes | Flickr Commons.) Samarco, BHP and Vale’s joint venture in Brazil, has reached a final compensation deal with local prosecutors over the 2015 collapse of a dam, which killed 19 people and became the country’s worst ever environmental disaster. The definitive agreement comes almost three years after the deadly incident that has already cost Samarco 4.4 billion reais (about 1.2 billion) on repairs and compensation, according to a statement quoted by Reuters.

It also means the companies might be able to get ready to resume operations in the region. Settlement means compensation payments to relatives of those who died in the disaster, as well as to hundreds of others who lost homes and other properties can begin. Samarco had said Monday it would start preparation work for a new pit for the disposal of tailings next week, in the same area where the one that failed was located. The new facility will have an overall capacity of 16 million cubic meters. The environmental catastrophe happened when a dam designed to hold back mine waste from the Samarco iron pellets operation burst, leaving a trail of destruction for hundreds of kilometres in Minas Gerais and Espírito Santo States. Brazilian federal prosecutors believe that both BHP and Vale failed to take actions that could have prevented the disaster. But the companies have repeatedly said they were not responsible for the dam’s collapse, adding that they complied with Brazilian law and that safety was and has always been a key concern. Samarco, which was once the world’s second-largest iron-ore pellet operation, has been shuttered since the deadly dam spill that washed downstream into neighbouring state Espírito Santo and even reached the Atlantic Ocean, 600 kilometres away. In December, Samarco was granted a preliminary permit to begin work towards preparing an eventual restart, which is likely to happen — though at a reduced rate first — in the second half of the year. Earlier this year, BHP announced that it had settled an initial 7 billion in damages with the Brazilian Government in order to provide a two-year window for the settlement of a larger 55 billion civil claim. It also said it would commit 211 million to the Renova Foundation created to help victims of the Samarco dam disaster in Brazil. Rio de Janeiro-based Vale (NYSE:VALE) is the world’s number one iron ore producer and BHP (ASX, NYSE:BHP) (LON:BLT) comes in at number three, behind fellow Australian miner Rio Tinto (ASX, LON:RIO).

A reported equipment malfunction at the Hebgen Dam caused river levels below the dam to drop.The worry here is that as it gets colder fish could be trapped. Hebgen Dam failure causes water level drop; brings community together to save trout “It's Montana it's part of Montana, it's part of our community,” says Smith “I just called the boss and got work off immediately and came out here and try to make something happen,” says Bozeman resident, Matthew Weaver.The urgency not only is it to save the fish but the community that this industry supports.“This is a livelihood for a lot of people in Ennis and West Yellowstone,” says Mary Margaret Smith. According to the USGS, since Tuesday water levels have dropped around a foot, it got to a low as around 600-650 cfs, where it has normally been flowing at around 850 cfs. Jason Fleury “Monitor the river and access conditions and doing what we can to move fish that are stranded back into the main channel,” says Public Information Officer for FWP Region 3 Morgan Jacobsen.Now FWP is monitoring the Madison River but also assisting the volunteers who came out.“It sounds like it’s going to be a scoop and grab,” says Weaver.The goal today was to cover as much area as possible as groups of fishers gathered along the banks of the river from Hebgen Dam to Ennis.“It’s a great demonstration of how much people care about the resources in the river here,” says Jacobsen.The fishermen and women that met along the Madison River say it's more than just helping save trout. Edgar Cedillo - MTN NEWS The goal today was to cover as much area as possible as groups of fishers gathered along the banks of the river from Hebgen Dam to Ennis. “It's Montana it's part of Montana, it's part of our community,” says SmithWhat caused the gate malfunction at the dam is unknown but fishermen and women we spoke with say they would like to know more.“[We] would like more answers from NorthWestern Energy about what actually happened,” says Smith.Right now Northwestern Energy officials say they are working to fix the dam but still haven't provided a timeline of when water flows could resume as normal. But Montana fishermen and women say they are ready to help out as long as needed “Right now we're just hanging on to the fact the community is gathered here together,” says Smith.MTN news will continue to bring more updates as they become available.RELATED:NorthWestern Energy hopes to have Hebgen Dam repaired soonCrews working to restore Hebgen Dam gate functionality and full river flows to the Madison River Copyright 2021 Scripps Media, Inc.

More disasters are coming, experts say.Aging dams around the country weren’t built for today’s weather. Without a major investment in repairs, thousands of people’s homes — and lives — could be in danger.Floodwaters fill the main street in Sanford, Mich., on May 20, 2020.Gregory Shamus / Getty Images fileLink copiedJune 13, 2020, 9:08 AM UTC / Updated June 14, 2020, 2:12 PM UTCBy Erin EinhornSANFORD, Michigan — When the first dam collapsed, a massive surge of water roared so swiftly into Mike Gorthy’s lakefront home that he returned from securing his boats outside to discover water above the light switches on his first floor.He hurried to cut the power, then went frantically searching for his wife, who had been downstairs.“I was looking around in the water and felt under the water and I just couldn't find her,” said Gorthy, 75, who waded through the bitterly cold, neck-high flood, dodging a refrigerator and a freezer that were floating on their sides. “I thought maybe she got electrocuted and was under the water and if I found her, I’d try to revive her.”When the water got too cold for him to bear, he retreated upstairs, despondent. “I thought I’d lost her,” he said.In fact, Gorthy’s wife, Judy, 72, had safely escaped the house, which is built into a hill and has its front door on the second floor. Her husband soon found her on the dry front yard talking to a neighbor — perhaps the most joyous moment of his life, he said. But the lakefront dream home the Gorthys bought when they retired 20 years ago was ravaged.By the end of the day, it wasn’t even on a lake.Mike and Judy Gorthy sit in their backyard in Sanford, Mich., where a dam failure May 19 flooded their home, sending Mike on a frantic search for his wife. Elaine Cromie / for NBC NewsThe urgent evacuation of 10,000 people from communities below two failing dams in central Michigan last month prevented the loss of life, but the collapsed dams expelled billions of gallons of water from two large lakes, sending them hurtling downstream in a powerful rush of destruction. Water ripped buildings off their foundations, smashed and twisted roads and bridges, damaged or destroyed an estimated 2,500 properties and triggered fears of contamination as it swept by a chemical plant and hazardous waste sites and submerged downtown Midland — a city of 40,000 people — under 9 feet of water.The disaster on May 19 and 20 caused at least 175 million in damage, authorities say, and left behind two empty lake beds. The Gorthys and other homeowners who once watched water skiers zip by their doors now gaze out on a soggy moonscape of sand pocked with mangled docks, half-buried pontoon boats and clusters of tree stumps that somehow remained under the water for a century since dams built to generate hydroelectric power first flooded the forest to create the Sanford and Wixom lakes.The Tittabawassee River has now returned to its natural size, gently flowing like a line drawn through the middle of the two giant bowls where the lakes used to be.The Tittabawassee River runs through a nearly empty Wixom Lake on June 2.Elaine Cromie / for NBC NewsLike the vast majority of the homes affected, the Gorthys’ was not in an area identified by the federal government as high risk for flooding, meaning they didn’t have flood insurance. (Fewer than 10 percent of the damaged properties did, county officials say.)They had no idea their home or their lives were in danger. But dam experts say that not only were the events in Michigan not surprising, they’re also likely to play out again at dams all over the country in the coming years — in potentially more devastating ways.Thousands of Americans live downstream from aging dams that have fallen into disrepair. Many of those dams are privately owned. Many no longer generate electricity. Many have not complied with laws requiring them to file emergency evacuation plans. Many are facing unprecedented weather conditions from climate change, with higher waters and heavier rains. And without a concerted — and fully funded — effort to repair or remove dams, experts warn that lives could be in danger.“We need to be more proactive and not reactive,” said Tom Smith, the executive director of the American Society of Civil Engineers. “Our infrastructure is critical to our quality of life and to life itself but we have failed to adequately invest in and maintain our infrastructure.”The cost of repairing life-threatening dams across the country could top 20 billion, Smith said — roughly 2,000 times more than the federal government earmarked for that purpose in its most recent budget.It’s expensive, but the cost of skipping repairs could be much higher, Smith said. “There is a terrible cost to failing to invest.”‘There's a big gap’As the people of Midland and its surrounding areas clean up the damage, they’re facing difficult questions that could presage similar discussions experts say need to take place around the country.Among them: Who should own dams? Who should pay for their repairs? And, in many places: Should they exist at all?The remains of the Sanford dam on May 20.Gregory Shamus / Getty ImagesThere are more than 90,000 dams in the United States, according to a federal inventory. Among them, more than 15,000 are considered high-hazard dams, meaning they’re close enough to populated areas that life or property could be threatened if they fail.Of those high-hazard dams, more than 2,300 have been so poorly maintained they’re in unsatisfactory condition, said Mark Ogden, project manager at the Association of State Dam Safety Officials.And many dam owners — 64 percent of whom are private entities — don’t have the money to make repairs, he said. “There’s a big gap between what’s needed and the actual resources.”The dam safety organization has documented 250 dam failures since 2010, plus more than 500 other incidents that were caught and fixed just ahead of a failure. Most were small and had limited impact, but some were catastrophic, including a dam break in Nebraska last year that killed a man when it washed away his house.Alarmingly, roughly 1 in 5 high-hazard dams don’t have emergency plans on file with local officials, making a safe evacuation difficult, Ogden said.RelatedNewsNewsFloods devastate Michigan town after dams breakAnd homeowners often have no inkling of the threat. Dam owners in most states are not required to notify people if they’re in a zone that could get flooded. Mortgage lenders, who typically require homeowners to get a flood certification to determine if a property is in a flood plain, don’t have similar requirements for houses near dams.But people who live near dams need to start paying attention, especially as they’re battered with extreme weather that the designers of the dams in the 20th century never expected, said Brian Graber, the senior director of river restoration for American Rivers, a nonprofit.What happened in Midland “is not close to being an isolated incident,” he said.‘A gifted life for a poor boy’Wixom and Sanford lakes, which were created by the Edenville and Sanford dams in the 1920s, have existed as long as anyone in the Midland area can remember.Daniel Lackey, 70, was just 5 when his father scraped together savings from his job at a General Motors plant in Flint to buy a small cottage with cement floors on Wixom Lake — a basic retreat that lacked indoor plumbing for years.He spent his childhood summers fishing, playing badminton and jumping from the diving board that he and his brothers crafted at the end of their dock.“It was a gifted life for a poor boy,” Lackey said, recalling the summer he skipped driver’s ed to build a hydroplane with his brother from plans the two found in a magazine.He brought his wife, Kayann, there for the first time when she was 17 and he was home on leave from the U.S. Air Force. Their children and nieces and nephews grew up there, and now bring their own children and grandchildren — the cottage’s fourth and fifth generations.Lackey and wife moved to the lake full time after he retired from General Motors and Kayann, now 67, retired from her work as a Montessori preschool director.Their daughter, Sarah Schulz, built a cottage next door to her parents with her husband a few years ago. The whole clan, including Schulz’s two children, were at the lake last month when the local fire department came down their street, urging them to get to higher ground.Andrew and Sara Schulz stand with her parents, Daniel and Kayann Lackey, in their yard beside a now-empty Wixom Lake.Elaine Cromie / for NBC NewsThey decided to stay because they thought their cottages were high up enough to be safe. “We’ve been here since 1960 and the water just was always where it should be,” Lackey said.As the water rose, the family gathered kayaks just in case. But Kayann, who was forced into the second floor of her cottage as the first floor filled with water, is disabled and couldn’t get into a kayak.Eventually, “it got to be terrifying,” said Schulz, who is running as a Democrat to represent the area in the state Legislature. She posted an SOS on Facebook that helped the family get rescued by a man in a pontoon.A pontoon boat pulls up to Sarah Schulz's porch to rescue the Lackey and Schulz families from their flooded cottages.Courtesy of Sarah SchulzThe family is grateful that no one was hurt, but a lifetime of prized belongings washed away, including the American flag that Lackey’s nephew brought home from the Air Force. The Lackeys helped raise their niece and nephew after Lackey’s brother was killed in a convenience store robbery in Flint in 1993.The young man joined the Air Force to follow in his uncle’s footsteps. The flag he brought home was so treasured, Lackey said, his voice cracking with grief, he only flew it on the Fourth of July.Now, like most of the Lackeys’ cottage, it’s gone. As they try to rebuild, the couple is living on the second floor despite Kayann’s difficulty with stairs. They have no kitchen, no shower and no electricity.They spent most of their savings renovating a house that is now in tatters. They had no flood insurance and, while they hope they’ll qualify for federal emergency funds, they’re not sure where they’ll get the money to rebuild.The only thing Lackey knows for sure, he said, is that he isn’t going anywhere.“I still plan to live here until I die,” he said. “This is where my father died and hopefully this is where I’ll die.”‘Enforcement is the issue’Most American dams were built in the 20th century to serve mills or factories that are long gone, Graber of American Rivers said.In most of the country, it’s difficult to make money generating hydroelectricity since turning a profit typically requires the force of a large river as it makes a steep drop. Small dams in flat states like Michigan have thin margins at best, Graber said.“Many, perhaps most, of the dams in the United States are no longer serving the purpose they were built to provide,” he said. “A very high percentage should be removed for health and safety reasons, as well as environmental benefits.”Graber, whose organization works to remove dams, said restoring a river to its natural state can improve public safety and water quality, allowing fish to migrate freely. He says homeowners like the Lackeys and the Gorthys will soon see grass growing on their lake bed and might come to enjoy living beside a verdant meadow with a river running through it.The Lackey and Schulz families' lakefront cottages now look out on a nearly empty Wixom Lake.Elaine Cromie / for NBC NewsThe river in its natural state would also be less likely to flood downstream in Midland, he said.But Sanford and Wixom lakes are deeply intertwined with the economy of the region. Lakefront property owners pay high taxes that the region depends on, and local businesses have long catered to boaters.People on the lakes are adamant that their waterfront be restored. But, in the aftermath of the flood, as residents, state officials and the dams’ owner, Boyce Hydro, LLC, all blame one another for the disaster, it’s not clear what will happen next — or who will make those decisions.Many of the homeowners blame Lee Mueller, the man who bought Boyce Hydro as a tax shelter in 2006, according to court records reviewed by Bridge Magazine. Since then, the company, which operates four dams including the two that failed, has been cited for a host of safety violations that warned the Edenville dam couldn’t withstand heavy rains.Mueller blames state and federal agencies, who he says imposed so many regulations — and made rules barring private dam owners like him from receiving federal financial support — that he didn’t have the money to make needed repairs.“Unfortunately, environmental protection took precedence over public safety,” said Lawrence Kogan, an attorney for Mueller.Mueller has also blamed the homeowners who he says have pressured him for years to keep water levels high so they could go boating, when he wanted them lower for safety reasons. The state compounded that pressure by raising concerns over lower water levels hurting freshwater mussels in the lake — an issue that triggered a state lawsuit against Boyce this year, just weeks before the flood.In 2018, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which oversees hydroelectric dams, was so alarmed by safety concerns at the Edenville dam that it yanked Boyce’s license to produce power there. That meant the company had even less money to make repairs.The dam then fell under the oversight of the state, which regulates dams that don’t produce electricity. The state, which has just two inspectors and a supervisor to keep tabs on about 1,000 dams, also warned that repairs were needed, but neither agency found a way to compel Mueller to make the repairs.“Enforcement is the issue. That's where this fell apart,” said Jim Hegarty, the past president of the Michigan section of the American Society of Civil Engineers and the co-author of two reports on the state of Michigan’s dams.States need tools, such as the ability to make dam owners post bonds that could pay for needed repairs, he said. States also could help pay for those repairs, he added, but Michigan is among states that have no dedicated funding for that purpose.Boyce had been trying to sell the dams to a consortium of homeowners on the lakes, who had planned to raise money through a property tax assessment to make repairs. Late last year, the Four Lakes Task Force estimated the four Boyce dams needed 20 million in repairs. But the dams failed before that sale could go through.The disaster has prompted a slew of lawsuits, with some homeowners suing Boyce and others also suing the state for poor oversight. On Tuesday, the state, which is conducting an investigation, filed suit against Boyce. The company responded the next day, putting the blame back on the state and asking to move the suits to federal court.What’s nextNo one knows how much it will cost to rebuild the dams, but it’s definitely going to be expensive — and it’s not clear who would cover the cost.Many homeowners on the lake say they want to get the dams out of Mueller’s hands.“When you have a private person owning something like a dam and trying to own it for the sake of his own profits, then you end up with bad decisions,” Schulz, Lackey’s daughter, said. “This was not a natural disaster. This was a dam that was neglected and it failed. This was a man-made disaster.”The Schulz and Lackey cottages during the flooding.Courtesy of Sarah SchulzIf homeowners want the dams out of Mueller’s hands, however, they’ll have to buy them, Kogan said. His client has no intention of just giving them away and losing his investment.U.S. Rep. John Moolenaar, R-Mich., who represents the area, said the two lakes “are a tremendous resource for the region” and need to be restored, whether that means raising money from private corporations or from a public-private partnership."We’re going to have an all-hands-on-deck approach to look at a variety of options and work together to solve this,” he said.Some locals are hoping the state and federal governments will help buy and repair the dams, but that might not go over well with people who don’t live on the lakes.Peter Sinclair, a videographer from Midland who has traveled the world documenting the effects of climate change, was surprised last month when he found his own city underwater. Midland, he said, has experienced some flooding but had always been safe from major climate disasters such as hurricanes and forest fires.He doesn’t think it makes sense for taxpayers to spend money on dams that could fail again in the future — particularly when both state and local agencies are already facing a severe economic crisis from the coronavirus.As he watches his city try to recover from the dam collapse, he hopes this disaster in Michigan will be a wake-up call for people around the country.“What happened here is not isolated,” he said. “This potential situation exists in thousands of places across the Midwest where people have not felt threatened by climate change but global change is combining with decaying infrastructure to accelerate the time when many communities are going to be faced with the same issues.”CORRECTION (June 14, 2020, 10:12 a.m. ET): An earlier version of this article misstated the number of dams regulated by the Michigan government.

Investigation: Bad decisions key to Oroville Dam failureNews Sports Opinion Business Entertainment Lifestyle E-Edition Legals Best of the North State NEWSInvestigation: Bad decisions key to Oroville Dam failureStaff reportsView CommentsView CommentsState officials charged with managing Oroville Dam created an unprecedented evacuation emergency last February in part by ignoring the advice of technical experts and trying to avoid flooding a powerhouse, an independent investigator concluded in a scathing report released Friday morning. The Independent Forensic Team Report, after an investigation that stretched through most of last year, also found that the California Department of Water Resources suffers from a bureaucratic, insular culture that hasn't matured to prioritize safety, and that the result has been, in part, a failure to learn from the latest advances in the industry. "Like many other large dam owners, DWR has been somewhat overconfident and complacent regarding the integrity of its civil infrastructure and has tended to emphasize shorter-term operational considerations," the report said. "Combined with cost pressures, this resulted in strained internal relationships and inadequate priority for dam safety."But the problems that built up to last February's near-catastrophe also extend all the way back to the construction of Oroville Dam, America's tallest at 742 feet. The spillway cracked almost immediately after construction, the investigators found, but that was never treated as a serious issue.In addition, they said, dam operators accepted wrong information for decades about the quality of rock beneath the spillway. So they were unprepared for the scale of damage once a slab lifted and water poured into the hole.More:Oroville mayor lashes out over dam communicationsState sets initial water allocation of 15%; amount likely will riseThe report stops short of laying direct responsibility, however."The incident cannot reasonably be 'blamed' mainly on any one individual, group, or organization," the summary says.In fact, the report's author's issued a stark warning to the entire industry, raising questions for any community downstream of large dams. Many of the Oroville failings apply broadly to dam managers, they wrote."The question is whether dam owners, regulators, and other dam safety professionals will recognize that many of these lessons are actually still to be learned. Although the practice of dam safety has certainly improved since the 1970s, the fact that this incident happened to the owner of the tallest dam in the United States, under regulation of a federal agency, with repeated evaluation by reputable outside consultants, in a state with a leading dam safety regulatory program, is a wake-up call for everyone involved in dam safety."But during a telephone press conference Friday afternoon, John France, leader of the independent team, said communities downstream from dams shouldn’t be alarmed and that the situation is not dire.“If you look at the record of frequency or occurrences of dam incidents, like Oroville, or dam failures, they occur relatively rarely. If you look at U.S. dam safety failures that have cost lives, they happen less frequently. So people should not lose sleep, but they should be concerned about it,” France said.France emphasized that more resources should be allocated to protect dams, which he says are a valuable part of the country’s infrastructure.“But there is time to do that; we shouldn’t wait any longer,” he said. “We should learn from this and we should do better.”Read: Report: Oroville Dam's spillway never had a comprehensive reviewThe Independent Forensic Team consists of six experts recommended by the Association of State Dam Safety Officials and the United States Society on Dams. The experts worked under contracts with the state DWR, but, the report says, they acted with complete independence and did not run their findings by DWR for approval before making the report final.According to a prepared statement by the DWR, the department agreed with the conclusion of the findings, stating that "all dam owners need to reassess current procedures."“We strongly supported having an independent assessment of the spillway failure and take the findings very seriously,” said DWR Director Grant Davis. “This report is consistent with the independent team’s initial technical findings from last May which were fully incorporated in the design of the reconstructed spillways. As we have done in the past, we will carefully assess this report, share it with the entire dam safety community and incorporate the lessons learned going forward to ensure California continues to lead the nation on dam safety.”France said DWR officials cooperated with his team and never withheld or denied information requests. However, the state agency needs to improve its management system for dam safety information.“One thing we found was that it was challenging to find the information you want,” France said. “We don’t feel . . . that DWR was holding any information back from us; just the information was not organized necessarily in an easy way to find everything.”Read: Small cracks in Oroville Dam's new spillwayDWR officials also stated that the department has already made "significant progress to bolster the dam safety program" by including comprehensive inspections to include "extensive hydrologic, structural a geotechnical work  and a thorough investigation of records."The state agency agreed that the report was a "wake-up call for everyone involved in dam safety.""During the incident, our sole focus was protecting public safety,” said Joel Ledesma, deputy director of the State Water Project. “DWR supported this independent assessment — so we can learn from the past and continue to improve now and into the future.”North State Congressman Doug LaMalfa, R-Richvale, whose district includes Oroville, also participated in Friday’s telephone conference and asked France several questions, including whether France was troubled that older records for Oroville Dam were incomplete or just not there.“It is troubling in some ways,” France said. “Unfortunately, I have to say it’s what we run into a lot. A lot of organizations, what happens is they get pressed for space.”Those paper documents inside an old filing cabinet taking up room get tossed, France said, because the agency needs more space.“It is concerning, troubling, but not unusual,” France said.Read:California drought's biggest lesson? Build more water storageAfter the telephone conference, LaMalfa said he will continue to ask the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to withhold Oroville Dam’s re-licensing for a short period of time so everybody can digest the final report. The dam has been operating on a temporary license for several years while it works toward a 50-year license, which LaMalfa supports."It's not unreasonable to wait a few months before we do the big license. It isn't unreasonable for the size of the problem we had with the spillway, the evacuations — people are spooked by this," LaMalfa said.LaMalfa said crews have done a good job reconstructing the spillway."I feel a lot of good coming forward from what we have learned, but we need to keep pressing on," he said.View CommentsView CommentsAbout Us Staff Directory Careers Accessibility Support Site Map Legals Our Ethical Principles Terms of Service Privacy Policy Your California Privacy Rights / Privacy PolicyDo Not Sell My Info / Cookie PolicyContact Us Support Local Businesses Advertise Your Business Advertising Terms and Conditions Buy and Sell Licensing & Reprints Help Center Subscriber Guide My Account Give FeedbackSubscribe Today Newsletters Mobile Apps Facebook Twitter E-Edition Storytellers Archives RSS FeedsJobs Cars Homes Classifieds Education Reviewed USA TODAY Sports+ 10Best Reach Local© 2022 www.redding.com.

Continue Why Samarco tailings dam failed Michael Allan McCrae | August 29, 2016 | 3:35 pm Top Companies Latin America Iron Ore Samarco failed after some small earthquakes caused an already stressed tailings dam to liquify, according to the Fundão Tailings Dam Review Panel that released its findings today. The November 2015 dam failure resulted in 19 deaths. The owners of Samarco, BHP Billition and Vale, have earmarked US1.3 billion to pay for damages. Sign Up for the Iron Ore Digest Sign Up The panel review was formed by the law firm Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP, which was retained by Vale and BHP Billiton. Chair of the panel is Norbert Morgenstern, who also conducted a review into the cause of the failure of the Mount Polley tailings dam in 2014. The panel did not assign liability or fault for the Samarco failure. The panel found that three small seismic shocks triggered the collapse, but the dam’s failure was “already well advanced” caused by a string of design and maintenance failures. The tailings dam became stressed through a series of “construction defects” stretching back to 2009 that “introduced the potential for sand liquefaction.” “The first incident occurred in 2009 shortly after the Starter Dam was completed,” writes the panel in its report. The starter dam was eventually subsumed by the larger dam as more capacity was added. “Due to construction defects in the base drain, the dam was so badly damaged that the original concept could no longer be implemented. Instead, a revised design substituted a new drainage blanket at a higher elevation. “Together with the revised design there was a fundamental change in the design concept whereby more widespread saturation was allowed and accepted. This increase in the extent of saturation introduced the potential for sand liquefaction.” The Fundão tailings dam in 2015 before its failure The report finds later mishaps: deposition of slimes in areas that were not not intended and structural problems with the concrete conduit that caused the dam to be raised over the slimes. By 2015 parts of the dam were already in a precarious state and eventual failure was already “well advanced”. Three small seismic shocks caused the dam to fail: Computer modeling showed that the earthquake forces produced an additional increment of horizontal movement in the slimes that correspondingly affected the overlying sands. Although the movements are quite small and the associated uncertainties large, this additional movement is likely to have accelerated the failure process that was already well advanced. Hence the failure of the Fundão tailings dam by liquefaction flowsliding was the consequence of a chain of events and conditions. A change in design brought about an increase in saturation which introduced the potential for liquefaction. As a result of various developments, soft slimes encroached into unintended areas on the left abutment of the dam and the embankment alignment was set back from its originally-planned location. As a result of this setback, slimes existed beneath the embankment and were subjected to the loading its raising imposed. This initiated a mechanism of extrusion of the slimes and pulling apart of the sands as the embankment height increased. With only a small additional increment of loading produced by the earthquakes, the triggering of liquefaction was accelerated and the flowslide initiated. There is an excellent step-by-step video showing the series of mishaps leading to the failure. The panel chairman sums up the findings of the panel in the video below.

At one point up to 70,000 people were in immediate danger. The Army Corps of Engineers thinks it can fix the breach, but the dam is not secure and is yet another example of Puerto Rico's crumbling infrastructure that is barely standing after Hurricane Maria hit the island. ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: When Hurricane Maria ripped across Puerto Rico 19 days ago, it tore a hole in the emergency spillway of one of the island's largest dams. It has yet to be fixed. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers says it hopes to contain the damage soon before it poses a bigger problem to neighboring communities. NPR's Carrie Kahn reports. (SOUNDBITE OF HELICOPTER BUZZING) CARRIE KAHN, BYLINE: On top of the Guajataca Dam in Puerto Rico's northwest corner, a huge marine CH-53 helicopter hovers over the reservoir's roadway. It locks onto a chain attached to a 5-ton concrete barrier like one of those you see on the side of the highway and lifts that giant block straight into the air. Within minutes, it's hovering over the dam's collapsed spillway teetering over the massive breach. The pilot then releases the barrier. DENNIS ZEVENY: Basically they're flying five, six hours a day. (SOUNDBITE OF HELICOPTER BUZZING) KAHN: The huge, whirling rotors are so loud you can't hear the barrier hit the ground even though I'm standing not that far away with Dennis Zeveny of the Army Corps of Engineers. Each round trip takes about five minutes from pickup to drop-off, so we have to talk fast. ZEVENY: On a good day, we're getting probably about 110 to 120 in the hole. KAHN: Here he comes again. We're going to have to pause. (SOUNDBITE OF HELICOPTER BUZZING) KAHN: Zeveny says the plan is to fill up the hole and water from coming over the spillway so it won't collapse any more. Heavy rains since Hurricane Maria aren't helping. The reservoir is still almost full with nearly 11 billion gallons of water, putting a lot of pressure on the earthen dam itself, says Zeveny. OK, he just dropped the concrete barrier, and we can start up again. This looks bad. ZEVENY: It's very similar to what happened at Oroville Dam in California, just smaller scale. And they saved that, so I'm confident we can save it as well. KAHN: They weren't on an island. ZEVENY: That is true. KAHN: He says shoring up the dam is the Corps' main priority. It did receive some upgrades in the 1980s, but like most of Puerto Rico's ailing infrastructure, the dam reportedly hasn't been regularly inspected. A breach would not only flood out communities below but threaten the water supply to 350,000 Puerto Ricans. And clean water is in short supply around the island. Some 40 percent still don't have any. Downstream from the dam, the water is just flowing at a fast, fast pace through the agricultural irrigation outlet. It's just coming through here really hard and fast. And all residents down here have been under mandatory evacuation. But some just won't leave. JOSE MUNOZ SOLER: (Speaking Spanish). KAHN: Fifty-six-year-old Jose Munoz Soler says he's lived in what he calls the stretch of paradise his entire life. You are under mandatory evacuation orders, but you're not leaving. (Speaking Spanish). SOLER: (Speaking Spanish). KAHN: "I'm not leaving," he says. Munoz did evacuate immediately after the hurricane with his family, but he says he's been in a shelter for more than two weeks. The place is crowded. Food is running out, and it's hot in there. He says he can't take it anymore and has come back home. SOLER: (Speaking Spanish). KAHN: "One's house is your home. It's not easy to walk away from it," he says. His neighbor Ziegfrido Seigert agrees. He says he's sure the dam won't break. After all, it's held up all these years. ZIEGFRIDO SEIGERT: (Speaking Spanish). KAHN: "We're in trouble," he says, "if it keeps raining and they can't safely release the water." SEIGERT: (Speaking Spanish). KAHN: And he adds, "please, please don't bring us any more hurricanes."

Bipartisan congressional panel seeks answers on Edenville Dam failureNews Sports Autos Business Michigan Life + Home Entertainment Opinion Obituaries MICHIGANBipartisan House committee seeks state's answers on Edenville Dam failure Beth LeBlancThe Detroit NewsView Comments A congressional committee has asked the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy for additional information on the Edenville Dam, which broke May 19, flooding the Midland area and forcing the evacuation of more than 10,000 people. The U.S. House Committee on Energy and Commerce asked in a Friday letter for more details about what actions Michigan took or didn’t take to secure the Edenville Dam after jurisdiction was shifted to the state from the federal government in 2018.The committee includes Michigan U.S. Reps. Fred Upton, R-St. Joseph; Debbie Dingell, D-Dearborn; and Tim Walberg, R-Tipton. The letter sent to EGLE Director Leisl Clark requests information about the state’s evaluation of the dam in the past two years and any regulatory or legal action taken in recent months against the dam owner Boyce Hydro. Federal lawmakers sent a similar letter to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to discern its actions surrounding the dam prior to 2018. “This inquiry is critical to ensuring this never happens again in any city in America with a high hazard dam,” Upton and Dingell said in a Monday statement. “It is concerning there are serious gaps in existing laws and gathering the facts will be essential as we consider future bipartisan legislation to protect communities across the country.”Clark has received the letter and "looks forward to providing the committee with answers," said Hugh McDiarmid, a spokesman for the environmental department. Among the questions asked of Clark in the letter are ones pertaining to state communication with federal authorities about the dam; the state’s perceived obligations in relation to the dam; any legal and regulatory efforts the state took since 2018; and what action was taken after the state found in January that the dam didn’t meet flood capacity standards. The letter also inquiries about resources dedicated to dam safety in Michigan. According to the agency, the state has two staff members and a supervisor in a dam safety unit responsible for 1,059 dams. Jurisdiction over the dam shifted from federal regulators to Michigan’s environmental agency in 2018 after Boyce Hydro Power failed to comply with federal regulations for more than a decade. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission pulled Edenville Dam’s hydropower generation license in 2018 because of those violations. Despite federal concerns, the state’s initial "cursory" inspection of the Edenville Dam in October 2018 found that the structure was in “fair structural condition,” but it worked with the dam’s potential buyer, Four Lakes Task Force, to further examine the dam’s spillway capacity. As early as Jan. 31, the state found the dam was not able to meet the state’s flooding standard, which require dams to be able to handle half of the worst storm possible for the area. The state’s standard is half that of the federal standard, which requires dams to be capable of handline 100% of the worst possible flooding. Inspectors were awaiting a consultant's report by the end of March to confirm or dispute their analysis before determining what next steps were needed, McDiarmid said last week. The report was not completed.As the state worked to confirm that Jan. 31 finding, a fight between state regulators and Boyce escalated over water levels and the potential exposure of freshwater mussels on Wixom Lake when too much water was let out of the lake through Edenville Dam. On May 1, Attorney General Dana Nessel filed a lawsuit on behalf of the Department of Natural Resources and EGLE suing the dam company for lowering lake levels in the winters of 2018 and 2019 without state authorization, actions the state argued had exposed and killed thousands of endangered freshwater mussels. The lawsuit came roughly a month after EGLE granted Boyce a permit to raise water levels on Wixom Lake.Boyce manager Lee Mueller has argued the threat of the lawsuit and residents seeking higher lake levels for recreational purposes pressured him to request the permit to raise levels just prior to the flood. But the state had rejected that accusation, noting lake levels on Wixom Lake were established via court order and Mueller’s insistence on lowering levels during the winter was purely monetary. eleblanc@detroitnews.comView Comments Staff Directory Site Map Legals Terms of Service Privacy Policy Your California Privacy Rights / Privacy PolicyDo Not Sell My Info / Cookie PolicyContact Us Advertise Your Business Buy and Sell Licensing & Reprints Help Center Subscriber Guide My Account Give FeedbackSubscribe Today Newsletters Mobile Apps Facebook Twitter E-Edition Archives RSS FeedsJobs Cars Homes Classifieds Renvy.com Michigan.com© 2022 www.detroitnews.com.

News Bastrop State Park dam failure highlights safety by: David Barer Posted: May 26, 2015 / 06:15 PM CDT Updated: May 26, 2015 / 06:15 PM CDT by: David Barer Posted: May 26, 2015 / 06:15 PM CDT Updated: May 26, 2015 / 06:15 PM CDT SHARE AUSTIN (KXAN) — More than 35 million gallons of water barreled down a Central Texas creek Monday evening, after flooding caused a century-old dam to burst in Bastrop State Park. “(The dam) just got overtopped. We had such a tremendous downpour on wet ground,” Bastrop County Judge Paul Pape told KXAN. “The spillway couldn’t handle the volume of water going in the lake…Once the dam became overtopped, it just became too much.” Pape said he is not aware of any other dams in Bastrop that are in danger of failing. But while nobody was injured, the dam break highlights the variety of dangers posed by powerful floodwaters in a state where floods are common, and thousands of aging dams are exempt from regular state agency inspection. The Bastrop dam was last inspected in 2005, according to data from the National Dam Inventory. The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality conducts the bulk of all dam inspections in Texas, but more than 3,200 Texas dams are exempt from TCEQ inspection, said Warren Samuelson, dam safety program manager at the agency. TCEQ breaks down dams into three categories: low, significant and high hazard potential. Of the dams the TCEQ does inspect, Samuelson said the agency focuses on high-hazard dams, which could impact seven or more people that may be in homes, or businesses, or on roads downstream, among other criteria. “(A low-hazard dam) may be under our jurisdiction, but we don’t typically inspect them because they are low hazard,” Samuelson said. “We only have the resources to look at high- and significant-hazard dams.” The Bastrop State Park Lake dam had low-hazard potential, meaning it did not have people or roads that would be affected if it failed, Samuelson said. The TCEQ has about 4,000 dams under its jurisdiction, Samuelson said. After the TCEQ inspects its dams, the findings are reported to the owner of the dam, who must then make necessary fixes. The TCEQ also holds workshops to help teach people how to maintain dams. About 97 percent of Texas’ 7,310 dams are earthen. Most dams are privately owned and have low-hazard potential, according to the National Dam Inventory, which is maintained by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The inventory shows many dams in the state haven’t been inspected for more than a decade and some haven’t been inspected at all. Samuelson said those dams that do not list an inspection date likely haven’t been inspected because they are low hazard, or they do not fall under TCEQ jurisdiction anymore. As of Monday morning, Samuelson said he doesn’t have concerns about any other Central Texas dams, and his office had not heard of any other issues associated with dams. Nearly all areas of Bastrop State Park are currently closed, agency spokesman Steve Lightfoot said. “We are in the process of inspecting the park and there will definitely be some cleanup involved,” Lightfoot said. Pape said the lake is an important part of the aesthetics of the dam and officials will be looking to rebuild it. Copyright 2022 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved.

Nebraska dam had history of ice woes before fatal failure - ABC News ABC NewsVideoLiveShowsGuns in AmericaJan. 6LOG INInterest Successfully AddedWe'll notify you here with news aboutTurn on desktop notifications for breaking stories about interest? OffOnNebraska dam had history of ice woes before fatal failureA new report says the owners and regulators of a Nebraska dam that failed last year underestimated the potential for it to cause life-threatening damageByDavid A. Lieb and Michael Casey Associated PressApril 21, 2020, 5:04 PMFILE - This combination of file photos provided by the Nebraska Department of Natural Resources, shows the Spencer Dam near Spencer, Neb., in November 2013, top, when it was holding back water on the Niobrara River and again in March 2019, after the dam failed during a flood. The dam that collapsed under pressure from an icy flood had a history of unaddressed ice issues and had no formal emergency plan because regulators wrongly assumed that no one would die if it failed, according a report released Tuesday April, 21, 2020. (Nebraska Department of Natural Resources via AP)The Associated PressA Nebraska dam that collapsed under pressure from an icy flood had a history of unaddressed ice problems and had no formal emergency plan because regulators wrongly assumed that no one would die if it failed, according a report released Tuesday.However, the investigation concluded there was nothing the dam's operators could have done in the early morning of March 14, 2019, to prevent Spencer Dam from failing after an unusually intense storm created a raging flood of ice chunks on the Niobrara River in rural northern Nebraska.Kenny Angel, who lived just beneath the dam, died when the flood washed away his home and business. Workers for the Nebraska Public Power District, which operated the dam, warned Angel just minutes ahead of time of the impending danger but fled without him. The failed hydroelectric dam was featured in an Associated Press investigation in November that found scores of dams nationwide in even worse condition, and in equally dangerous locations. The AP identified 1,688 high-hazard dams — meaning loss of life is likely if they fail — rated in poor or unsatisfactory condition as of last year in 44 states and Puerto Rico. Nebraska regulators had categorized Spencer Dam as a “significant hazard" — a rating that meant no loss of life was expected if it failed, and no formal emergency action plan was required. Tuesday's report by the Association of State Dam Safety Officials said the dam should have been rated as “high hazard," which could have led to a plan to increase its flood capacity and provide better warning to downstream residents. The dam's hazard rating dated to the 1970s and hadn't undergone a comprehensive re-evaluation using newer techniques, the report said. Nebraska's chief dam safety engineer, Tim Gokie, defended the classification. He said multiple engineers and organizations had reviewed it over the years and rated it as anywhere from low to significant hazard. Mark Becker, a spokesman for the Nebraska Public Power District, said staff members were reviewing the report and had no immediate comment.The report cited the wrong classification as one of two human factors contributing to the dam's failure and devastating consequences. It said state regulators were unaware the dam had failed under ice pressure in March 1935 and been damaged by ice on the river in March 1960 and March 1966. The past ice incidents “could have been warning signs to the dam owner and regulator,” the report said, but historical records about the dam were lost, unorganized or unavailable. Gokie said the state office has only limited information on dams before 1967, when it began routine inspections. State inspections of Spencer Dam were done in the warm-weather months, when there was no ice on the river, and focused only on observable deficiencies, not less-visible vulnerabilities, the report said.As a result, “while the dam appeared to be well maintained, no provisions were made to pass or prepare for ice run events,” the report said. After its 1935 failure, the dam was rebuilt in 1940 in a way that actually made it harder to pass ice chunks through its nine, 33-foot (10-meter) wide flood gates, the report said. That was problematic because the Niobrara River is especially prone to large ice flows.Mark Baker, the leader of the panel that produced the report, said the failure of Spencer Dam has lessons for other dams, especially those in colder climates.“If you are in charge of inspecting or evaluating the safety of any dam in cold weather regions, you need to screen for whether ice runs are a potential there and could damage your dams,” said Baker, who heads a dam consulting company in Denver.“We have known for a long time that ice can put pressure on dams. Ice can squeeze up against a gate and keep it from opening,” he said. "But this idea that the chunks can come down in the thousands in rivers and cause overtopping flows is a new concept.”Baker also said safety engineers need to go beyond simply inspecting dams and start looking at their history, how they were constructed and how they would performs in a disaster.Top StoriesFauci experiencing Paxlovid rebound after testing positive for COVID this monthJun 29, 11:12 AMWoman walking with baby stroller shot to death in NYC4 hours agoFormer Trump White House counsel Pat Cipollone subpoenaed by Jan. 6 committee4 hours agoGOP must choose Trump or the Constitution, Liz Cheney warns: 'It is undeniable'4 hours agoTrump White House attorney disputes Hutchinson's testimony about handwritten noteJun 28, 11:07 PMABC News Live24/7 coverage of breaking news and live eventsABC News NetworkPrivacy PolicyYour CA Privacy RightsChildren's Online Privacy PolicyInterest-Based AdsAbout Nielsen MeasurementTerms of UseDo Not Sell My InfoContact UsCopyright © 2022 ABC News Internet Ventures.

Mike Christy / Arizona Daily Star Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Copy article link Save Carmen Duarte , Gloria Knott Less than a day after officials worried that a dam on the Tohono O’odham Nation would overflow into a community because of heavy rain and flooding from remnants of Tropical Storm Rosa, water levels dropped.But concern remains high about the structural integrity of the nearly century-old earthen dam, especially because more rain is forecast later in the week, tribal representatives said. The Tohono O’odham Nation declared a state of emergency.By Wednesday afternoon, water levels behind 22-foot Menagers Dam had gone down 4 feet from the previous night, National Weather Service officials said. Officials previously called dam failure “imminent.” Area residents were evacuated or urged to get to higher ground because of what a tribal representative called “unprecedented levels of flooding on the southwest side of the Tohono O’odham Nation, particularly in the vicinity of the Menagers Dam community.”Even as the water level in Menager Lake stabilized Wednesday afternoon, it remained above previous record levels, the weather service said.

Of those, 23 residents were given help to evacuate “and the rest left in their own vehicles, with a few refusing to leave,” the news release said. If Menagers Dam were to fail, the community would face flash flooding.Flash-flood warnings in the area were scheduled to remain in effect until Friday afternoon.The Tohono O’odham Nation’s police and emergency services offices worked to evacuate at-risk areas overnight Tuesday, according to a tribal representative. They received help from a U.S. Customs and Border Protection team and a Pima County Sheriff’s Department swift water rescue team.A number of shelters were made available to evacuees. Areas of the reservation received up to 7 inches of rain within 72 hours, and rainfall of 3 to 5 inches was widespread on the reservation, said Glenn Lader, a meteorologist with the weather service in Tucson. Flooding made some remote roads impassable and caused erosion, the Tohono O’odham news release said.Menagers Dam and Ali Chuk are in the Gu Vo District of the reservation, in Pima County and close to the U.S.-Mexico border. They are southwest of Sells, which is about 60 miles southwest of Tucson. Tohono O’odham emergency workers also evacuated the more than 30 residents of the Kohatk village in Pinal County overnight Tuesday, as water in an adjacent wash ran high and overflowed berms.About Menagers DamAccording to Arizona Place Names, produced in 1935 and revised in 1960, the dam and lake are named after Joe Menager. Joe Menager homesteaded at the lake during World War I, taking out rights to six square miles. He built a dam to create a water hole. The dam was completed shortly after 1920. In the 1930s he sold his township to the Papago Indian Reservation, now called the Tohono O'Odham Reservation. The main part of what is now the Tohono O'Odham Reservation was established in 1917.

Dam scary words for un-scary dam conditions - Washington State Department of Ecology Skip to main content Regulations & Permits Research & Data Blog Contact Us Search Search: Home Air & Climate Water & Shorelines Waste & Toxics Spills & Cleanup Search: Menu Close Menu Home I Want to... Air & Climate Water & Shorelines Waste & Toxics Spills & Cleanup Regulations & Permits Research & Data News Blog Contact Us Top Blog > What We Do > Dam scary words for un-scary dam conditions There are high hazard dams in poor condition! Quick, run for high ground! Or don’t. It’s not as terrifying as it may sound. A high hazard dam isn’t necessarily hazardous and poor condition doesn’t mean imminent failure. Ecology regulates 1,094 dams throughout the state. Our dam inspectors conduct frequent inspections. Reports on those inspections often use words that mean different things to the non-expert. Hazard category Our Dam Safety Office classifies all state-regulated dams as either low, significant, or high downstream hazard. This refers the potential impact on people, property, and the environment should a dam fail. Even a dam in pristine condition gets called “high hazard” if there are six or more people living downstream. A dam with at least one person downstream is called a “significant hazard”. A high or significant classification does not imply that the dam is unsafe. It only reflects the consequences of a dam failure and is used to establish suitable minimum design levels for the safety of the dam. The safety of the dam is a separate issue from the downstream hazard. Each dam in our jurisdiction must be designed within dam safety guidelines. The dam safety office reviews all documentation and approves dam designs once it complies with minimum design requirements. Condition assessment We use the same terminology as the National Inventory of Dams classification. Dam conditions include: Satisfactory - no existing or potential dam safety deficiencies Fair - no existing dam safety deficiencies recognized for normal conditions Poor - a dam safety deficiency recognized for conditions which may realistically occur and remedial action is necessary. This does not mean a dam is in imminent danger of failing. The deficiencies could be relatively minor and easy to fix Unsatisfactory - a dam safety deficiency is recognized that requires immediate or emergency remedial action Most of the dams we regulate are in satisfactory or fair condition. Periodic inspections The dam safety office performs periodic inspections on significant and high hazard dams every five years. The inspections are intended to identify deficiencies and reasonably assure safe operation. Dam owners are required to conduct annual surficial inspections and submit a copy of the inspection form/report to the Dam Safety Office. We review the reports and engineers provide technical support when needed. Emergency Action Plans (EAP) Emergency Action Plans are required for all significant and high hazard dams. An EAP describes procedures for responding to unusual or emergency situations and for warning individuals who may be at risk in downstream areas. The EAP establishes important communication lines and help reduce the risks in the event of a pending or actual failure.

Michigan Legislature seeks 500M to fund dam repairsNews Sports Autos Business Michigan Life + Home Entertainment Opinion Obituaries MICHIGANLegislature seeks 500M to fund dam repairs a year after Edenville failure Beth LeBlancThe Detroit NewsView Comments Lansing — The state Legislature plans to introduce new bills Thursday that would dedicate about 500 million in new funding toward dam repairs and emergency response, a year after the Edenville Dam failed amid historic rainfall and years of neglect. The plan dedicates funds for repairs to the failed Midland-area dams and five other identified high-risk dams. It also creates an emergency response fund and a fund that would provide state match dollars for federal money to rehabilitate or remove dams. The bills also will implement policy reforms recommended in the wake of the May 19, 2020 Edenville failure, such as requiring owners to keep better records of safety and maintenance efforts and proof of financial standing to handle potential issues with dams. Dams that present a significant safety risk would be inspected more frequently. “The people I talk to around here are concerned about something like this happening again and whether these old structures will ever really be fixed," said House Speaker Jason Wentworth, the Farwell Republican who represents some of the flooded areas in Gladwin County. "I get it — there’s been a lot of talk and too little action," Wentworth said in a statement. "With these bills, we are going to lock the state into a real plan big enough to actually fix the problem and fast enough to start delivering results in our most vulnerable areas before it’s too late.”Sen. Jim Stamas, R-Midland; Rep. Annette Glenn, R-Midland; Sen. Rick Outman, R-Six Lakes; and Rep. Roger Hauck, R-Union Township, also helped develop the plan. Democratic lawmakers  contributed to the package.“It was heartbreaking to see the devastation facing so many people, especially when almost all of it could have been prevented if improvements to the local dams had been made to ensure they could handle the water levels," said Stamas, who is chairman for the Senate Appropriations Committee. Residents have been struggling to restore their communities after the May 2020 Edenville Dam breach, which sent water rushing over and around the Sanford Dam and flooded area residents. About 10,000 residents were evacuated ahead of the flood and most have not yet been made whole. Many residents did not have flood insurance to pay for damages to homes and businesses. Repairs to the damaged Midland-area dams — Secord, Smallwood, Edenville and Sanford — will cost residents about 215 million in assessments over 40 years. Some restoration work won't be complete until 2026. Four Lakes Task Force, a group created by Midland and Gladwin counties to manage the dams, hopes to offset the 40-year assessment with the help of about 150 million in state and federal grants. It's not yet clear how much of the proposed 500 million would go directly to repairs identified by the Four Lakes Task Force. About 25 lawsuits remain pending against state and federal regulators in relation to the May 2020 dam failure. Government documents revealed years of non-compliance with state and federal standards, a fumbled hand-off of oversight between the feds and state, and an underfunded dam safety effort ill-equipped to hold the dam owner to task.eleblanc@detroitnews.comView Comments Staff Directory Site Map Legals Terms of Service Privacy Policy Your California Privacy Rights / Privacy PolicyDo Not Sell My Info / Cookie PolicyContact Us Advertise Your Business Buy and Sell Licensing & Reprints Help Center Subscriber Guide My Account Give FeedbackSubscribe Today Newsletters Mobile Apps Facebook Twitter E-Edition Archives RSS FeedsJobs Cars Homes Classifieds Renvy.com Michigan.com© 2022 www.detroitnews.com.

Duke Energy spokeswoman Paige Sheehan told The Associated Press on Friday that floodwaters were continuing to overtop an earthen dike at the north side of Sutton Lake, a 1,100-acre (445-hectare) reservoir at the L.V. Sutton Power Station. That water has caused breaches in the dam on the south end of the lake, which is flowing back into the river.

It was the first of many scheduled hearings where EGLE explained why the Edenville Dam was rated poorly and yet nothing had been done to avoid catastrophe before it hit. Much of it came down to a lack of resources and man power but many questions still went unanswered during the hearing. “It’s been neglected. Coming out of this we have 2600 dams in the state of Michigan and they are overseen in three to five year intervals,” says Sen. Curt VanderWall of Ludington, “There are flaws and we need to get busy. We need to figure out what we’re going to do because we can’t have another issue like this happens in the state” “We certainly always have oversight, whether we need to add funding or we need to look at the structures,” says Sen. Rick Outman of Six Lakes, “A lot of it is up in the air. We just going to move forward, look at the facts and determine the best course of action so we can prevent this from the future.” Several dams across the state have similar ratings as the Edenville Dam, including two in Cheboygan County. Those will take top priority when a plan is developed.

Almost five inches of rain fell in the area in the previous two days, after earlier storms had saturated the ground and swollen the Tittabawassee River, which the dam held back.No one can say yet whether the intense rainfall that preceded this disaster was made worse by climate change. But global warming is already causing some regions to become wetter, and increasing the frequency of extreme storms, according to the latest National Climate Assessment. The trends are expected to continue as the world gets even warmer.That puts more of the nation’s 91,500 dams at risk of failing, engineers and dam safety experts said.“We should expect more of these down the road,” said Amir AghaKouchak, a professor of civil engineering at the University of California, Irvine. “It’s unfortunate but this is what the trend is going to be.”Overall, he and others say, dams in the United States and elsewhere are unprepared for the changes coming in a warming world.The dam that failed Tuesday, forcing the evacuation of about 40,000 people in and around Midland, Mich., and threatening a chemical complex and toxic waste cleanup site, was designed a century ago, long before climate change was a concern.The dam, at Edenville Township, about 30 miles upstream from Midland, had severe design problems: It had been cited for having spillways that were inadequate to handle a maximum flood, whether affected by climate change or not. (A second dam at Sanford, 10 miles downstream, was overrun by the arriving floodwaters but did not collapse.)But the Edenville Dam was hardly alone in being outdated, with design or maintenance deficiencies or other problems that might make it unsafe. The American Society of Civil Engineers, in its latest report card on infrastructure in 2017, gave the nation’s dams a “D” grade.The average age of dams in the United States is nearly 60. And nationwide, about 15,500 are classified as having a high hazard potential; in Michigan, more than 170 dams are in that category, as was the Edenville Dam. Repairing and upgrading high-hazard dams alone could cost tens of billions of dollars.Since the mid-19th century there has been an average of about 10 dam failures a year in the United States, said Martin W. McCann Jr., a civil engineer who directs the National Performance of Dams Program at Stanford University. More than 90 percent of failed dams are less than about 50 feet high. (Edenville was 54 feet tall.)Rivers and reservoirs swollen by rainfall are the cause of most of the failures. “It’s not a new thing per se,” Mr. McCann said.But some recent dam episodes have been shown to have a climate change link. In February 2017, at Oroville Dam in California, the tallest in the nation, heavy mountain runoff into the reservoir led to the near-failure of an emergency spillway and severe damage to the main spillway. Nearly 200,000 people were evacuated as a precaution and repairs cost more than 1 billion.A later study found that human-caused warming had increased early season runoff in the Sierra Nevada, contributing to the high water levels at the dam.And there is little doubt that extreme rainfall events are getting more frequent. The fourth National Climate Assessment, issued in 2018, showed that the number of heavy precipitation two-day events has increased in all regions except the Southwest since the early 1900s. And since 1950, extreme events increased by more than 50 percent in the Midwest.But Bill McCormick, who is in charge of dam safety for the state of Colorado and is the incoming president of the Association of State Dam Safety Officials, said short-duration extreme precipitation wasn’t the only problem.Rainfall of longer duration but less intensity — an overall wetter climate, which climate models forecast for parts of the United States in coming decades — can contribute to the risk.“They tend to saturate the ground,” Mr. McCormick said. “Then, if you do get these four- or five- inch rains, the ground can’t absorb it.”Understand the Latest News on Climate ChangeCard 1 of 5Logging. The Congo River has become a highway for sprawling fleets of logs. Crews live aboard these rafts for a sliver of profit from the dismantling of the Congo Basin rainforest, which is becoming increasingly vital as a defense against climate change as the Amazon is felled.South Asia. India and other nations in the region, home to hundreds of millions of humanity’s most vulnerable, are on the front lines of climate change. As climatic extremes become the norm, it’s growing more difficult to address poverty, food security and health challenges.Great Salt Lake. Local politicians and scientists are warning that climate change and rapid population growth are shrinking the lake, creating a bowl of toxic dust that could poison the air around Salt Lake City. But there are no easy solutions to avert that outcome.Carbon dioxide levels. The amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere hit its highest level ever, scientists said. Humans pumped 36 billion tons of the planet-warming gas into the atmosphere in 2021, more than in any previous year.Hurricane season. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration expects an “above normal” Atlantic hurricane season this year. If that plays out, it would make 2022 the seventh consecutive year with an above-normal season.That was evident in the Michigan disaster, he said, where even though the two-day deluge was not considered the most extreme possible rainfall event, it still overwhelmed the dam because the ground was already saturated from several days of rain.Dam engineers have usually based their designs on past weather — what a decade or decades of data show about the maximum potential flood a dam would have to withstand. That would have been how the Edenville Dam was designed in the 1920s.But there was no expectation that future weather patterns might be different.This kind of thinking largely persists today, Mr. AghaKouchak said. “Still, our engineering design concept is based on the so-called stationary assumption — that things will stay the same,” he said.“But as we get more and more evidence of changes in extremes, the question is if it’s reasonable to stay with this stationary assumption,” he said. “The answer is, probably not.”Some designers are beginning to change their ways, said Robert J. Lempert, a principal researcher at the RAND Corporation who specializes in climate risk analysis. Legislation recently approved in California, for example, requires state engineers to take climate change into account when designing infrastructure projects.“If you’re building a dam you want to pull in climate change from the very beginning,” he said. “How is climate change going to affect the design of the dam, or even whether I want a dam at all?”For existing dams, operational changes might be called for, such as reducing the water levels behind the dam at certain times of year in anticipation of more extreme storms. “And you want to put climate change on the agenda for any maintenance and upgrades,” Mr. Lempert said.Those upgrades might include changing spillway designs to incorporate the kind of rainfall pattern that occurred in Michigan, Mr. McCormick said. Rather than one designed to handle high peak inflow from a short, extreme storm, designers may opt for one that could cope with larger volumes over a longer time period.“You need to look at how a given spillway is designed,” he said, “if the circumstances of the rainfall change.”AdvertisementContinue reading the main storySite Information Navigation© 2022 The New York Times CompanyNYTCoContact UsAccessibilityWork with usAdvertiseT Brand StudioYour Ad ChoicesPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleSite MapCanadaInternationalHelpSubscriptions

Evart and the Croton Dam are not directly at risk following this dam failure.ROSCOMMON TOWNSHIP, MI — Flood water reportedly is moving quickly downstream toward Old 27 and U.S. 127 after a dam failed in the area.A flash flood warning is in effect for southwestern Roscommon County until 6 p.m. Tuesday following the breakage of the Wraco Lodge Dam. Shortly after noon, the National Weather Service reported water was just inches below a U.S. 127 bridge.There is the possibility of water overtopping the highway between mile markers 185 and 186. Motorists are advised to not drive over flooded roads."The water is about a foot and a half from the top of the bridge, (and) traffic is still flowing over the freeway," Michigan State Police Trooper Kevin Flick said. He added there are no plans as of yet to shut down the highway.The dam reportedly was installed by the Department of National Resources in 2012 to control Wraco Lake's water level, according to The Houghton Lake Resorter. The DNR describes it as a wildlife dam, one that could help cut down on bank erosion.Water held back from this dam eventually will make its way downstream to Town Line Creek, Wolf Creek and the Muskegon River, which is is dealing with its own flooding issues.Osceola County Emergency Program Director Mark Watkins said he is aware of the dam breakage. Weather Service hydrologists informed him Evart and other locations further downstream will not be directly impacted."We were notified right away when it happened, and although that is going to eventually drain in our river, there are hundreds of miles of rivers and drainage prior to that getting to us," Watkins said. "The main impact (is that) we'll have a longer flooding event."A DNR secretary says they are aware the dam has failed, and a request for additional information was forwarded on to the appropriate person.Andrew Krietz covers breaking, politics and transportation news for MLive | The Grand Rapids Press.

The dam, which creates the Net River Flooding area, is located south of Covington and north of Crystal Falls. It was inspected in August 2020 and received a rating of “fair.”A person visiting the area Wednesday evening noticed the washed-out roadway around the dam and berm and contacted the DNR’s local field office.The sinkhole was about 20-by-30 feet and 10 feet deep, Bill Scullon, DNR wildlife operations field manager, told MLive. It was refilled Thursday, but the road is not yet open to traffic. A view of the washed-out area around the Net River dam and berm, resulting from a failed water control structure.

The DNR has already contacted some of the property owners to inform them that the road has washed away.Scullon said the situation is stable and will be monitored for the foreseeable future.The Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy dam inspectors and contractors are determining next steps to diminish continued erosion and are beginning the work to secure the sinkhole and backfill the impoundment.DNR parks and recreation staff are barricading the area for public safety. DNR conservation officers and Michigan State Police officers are on-site to assist with safety.There are three bridges downstream of the Net River dam. Two are on U.S. 141 and the other is a railroad bridge. Officials don’t expect the bridges will be affected, but local authorities have been notified. Authorities at the Paint River Dam, in Crystal Falls, also have been alerted and are making room for any additional water that could flow their way if the dam fails.“The situation at the Net River dam should pose no concern for area fish and wildlife,” Scullon said. “The amount of water moving through this structure is normal, and nothing we’ve seen downstream is unusual for what we would expect this time of year.”READ MORE:Volunteers needed to protect lake sturgeon from poachers during spawning runWoman falls headfirst into outhouse vault toilet trying to get phoneWhy so many bodies have been washing up along Chicago River, Lake MichiganNote to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission.DisclaimerRegistration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement, Privacy Policy and Cookie Statement, and Your California Privacy Rights (User Agreement updated 1/1/21.

Hydro workers discovered earlier in the day the millennial level of water had been reached.“We are confident that the structure is solid,” Racicot said. “But the protocols force us to warn people of the danger. We are entering into an unknown zone right now — completely unknown.”The largely rural section of river affected is in Quebec’s Lower Laurentians region, about 140 kilometres west of Montreal, stretching about 18 kilometres south to the Ottawa River.

Quebec provincial police tweeted they were helping about 250 people get clear of the affected area as a preventive measure.Provincial police spokesman Daniel Thibaudeau said 40 people had been removed to safety as of 7:30 p.m. Thursday, and the remainder would be taken out over the course of the evening.Several dozen officers were taking part in the operation with the aid of all-terrain vehicles and helicopters. About a dozen people living in areas not easily reached by land were airlifted out.Evacuees were being taken first to the town hall in nearby Grenville-sur-la-Rouge, and those with no alternative lodging were being transported to the arena in Lachute, about 40 kilometres away.Among those headed for the arena were Denise and Martin Audet, who had just returned home from some shopping when they heard police officers yelling that the area was being evacuated.“They told us that there was no time to pack our bags and that we had to leave because the dam was maybe going to break,” Denise Audet said. She said everything happened so quickly she “didn’t have time to be scared.”Tom Arnold, mayor of Grenville-sur-la-Rouge, said it could be weeks before evacuees can return home, even if the dam holds.“I don’t have confidence. The worst is yet to come,” he said when asked about the dam’s stability.Hydro-Quebec said through social media that if the dam breaks, the water flow would have minimal impact on locations downstream once it joined with the Ottawa River.According to the utility’s web site, the concrete dam, built in 1942, is 19 metres high and almost 60 metres long. It has the capacity to hold back 4 million cubic metres of water.The dam scare comes as many parts of Quebec have been hit by flooding. Officials say the flood risk remains high because of a combination of precipitation in the forecast and melting snow to the north.Earlier on Thursday, Guilbault toured the Lachute area, northwest of Montreal, where flood waters on the Riviere du Nord have risen in recent days.She said she was impressed with the level of preparation in smaller communities and was satisfied that the number of people on the ground working on flood relief — which includes nearly 1,000 Canadian soldiers — was sufficient.Guilbault added she wouldn’t hesitate to ask for more help if necessary.Quebec public security officials said more than 2,500 homes were flooded and more than 2,100 were isolated Thursday, meaning they were considered cut off due to washed out roads or landslides.Authorities also warned specifically against landslides reported in various parts of the province.One person has died since widespread flooding began in the province.In Montreal, officials raised the security level and increased the number of teams on the ground amid fears flooding could get worse in the coming days but stressed the situation was under control.“You’re going to see more firefighters, you’re going to see more police officers and more municipal workers to help for floods that could come this weekend,” said Martin Guilbault, operations chief of the Montreal fire department.Mayor Valerie Plante warned that anyone who was flooded in 2017 should prepare their homes for more flooding — and possible evacuation — if they haven’t done so.“The threat is actually very concrete and direct and this is the message we want to send the entire population,” she said.Environment Canada issued a rainfall warning for Montreal with 30 to 50 millimetres expected Friday and Saturday.Rain is expected to begin in southern Quebec midday Friday and intensify overnight, spreading eastward.In Ottawa, Mayor Jim Watson declared a state of emergency Thursday afternoon, calling in the Canadian Forces to help with flood protection in the capital.Report an errorRelated articlesCanadian Armed Forces deploy across Quebec after sinkhole caused by floods claims woman’s lifeApril 20, 2019Quebec’s Beauce region hardest hit by spring flooding, province on alertApril 16, 2019explainerHere’s what you need to know about flooding in Quebec, Ontario and New Brunswick April 25, 2019Your GlobeBuild your personal news feedMore infoFollow topics related to this article:QuebecFollowYou must be logged in to follow.Log InCreate free accountCheck Following for new articles

Alabama has the biggest dam problem in the U.S.News Sports Best of Section Business Go Play Opinion Obituaries E-Edition Legals Alabama has the biggest dam problem in the U.S.Andrew J. YawnMontgomery AdvertiserView CommentsView CommentsUrsula Powers walked by her kitchen window when she saw "a wall of water" surge through the trees."In no time it was over the road and onto the other side," Powers said. "If you were on the road it would have taken you away.”An earthen dam broke uphill from Powers’ home in Chelsea in Shelby County and flooded her neighborhood with 6 to 10 feet of water in September 2013.No property was damaged. Nobody was hurt. The dam has been rebuilt. In a state with almost no dam oversight, regulation or maintenance, however, Powers fears another flood could happen at any time.“I’m still afraid. I’m afraid it will come down again,” Powers said. “They were lucky nobody died that day.”Alabama is the only state without a dam safety program, a program that requires not only annual maintenance and inspection, but crucial record keeping on dams' conditions and how heavily a breach would affect residents downstream.The recent collapse of the Oroville Dam spillway in California aside, Alabama may have the biggest dam problem in the country.Where’s the dam data?After the catastrophe in Oroville where 200,000 people below the dam were evacuated as a precaution due to a combination of high water level and damage to the spillway, Diana Enright with the Oregon Water Resources Department did something Alabama has no ability to do: She checked her state's dam data.Of Oregon’s 15,000 dams, Enright said 75 are classified as high-hazard — dams that would most likely kill people after a failure. Of those, seven are currently in "unsatisfactory" condition.“Those are more closely inspected,” Enright said.Alabama is the only state in the country that can't check those numbers.On the American Society of Civil Engineers’ 2015 infrastructure report card, Alabama received an “incomplete” for its dams, citing the lack of an accurate inventory.The performance report for Alabama from the Association of State Dam Safety Officials (ASDSO) is equally lackluster and reported that, “the condition of most dams in Alabama is unknown.”The Army Corps of Engineers is the only organization that has attempted to track Alabama dam data.Spread across more than 132,000 miles of rivers and streams, the corps estimated in a 2015 survey that the state has about 2,271 dams. Of those dams, only 2 percent are held to federal standards of annual inspections and emergency actions plans (EAPs) and only because they are federally regulated. That means Alabama has no idea what condition 98 percent of its dams are in, including the dam uphill from Powers’ house.“Apparently when they constructed the dam a half a year or so before (the flood), they did a real lousy job, but we have no insight in that. We’re just living here,” Powers said. “There should definitely be (a state program) for safety reasons.”There's a reason why some say dam safety is only getting more important. The average age of dams nationwide is 52 years old. With most dams built to last about 50 years, the need for routine maintenance is only increasing, especially considering the majority of Alabama dams are like the one that broke in Shelby County in 2013: privately owned and unregulated."We do still find problems and issues, probably more so with private dams since they don't have the money to evaluate things and you don't know what kind of engineering goes into the private-owned dams," said Wayne King, a federal dam inspector with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC).Emergency action plansThe recent Oroville Dam spillway collapse in California was an unfortunate example of the benefit of a dam safety program. According to USA Today's nationwide dam safety investigation, the Oroville Dam was inspected in 2012 and 2015 instead of annually. Weather also had a large impact on the situation with heavy rains and rising lake levels creating much of the problem, but the emergency action plan — a dam safety program requirement — told officials what areas could be hit by water and where to evacuate.► Related: Wet weather could cause issues for crews at Lake Oroville DamOf the 676 high-hazard and significant-hazard dams in Alabama, 625 didn’t have an EAP in place, according to the 2015 Army Corps of Engineers survey. The dams that have EAPs are primarily federally regulated, hydroelectric utility dams that require oversight from the FERC and inspectors such as King.Of the 2 percent (51 dams) that require inspection, Alabama Power Dam Safety and Surveillance Supervisor Richard Mickwee oversees 14 of them.“The EAPs we write include information about what occurs in a dam safety event,” Mickwee said. “It talks about how we communicate with the state, EMA, first responders. They also include inundation maps, which show where the water would go, when it would get there and what the depth would be.”The Alabama EMA is confident in its ability to handle a dam failure, EMA Executive Operations Officer Jeff Byard said. While the state doesn’t have a database of EAPs for each individual dam, Byard said the state employs a one-size-fits-all “all-hazards plan” that is expected to handle any disaster scenario. The same plan that is in place for a dam failure would also be used for a tornado or hurricane.“Working with EMA and with our state and local partners, I feel like we’re prepared for any hazard. That’s the beauty of the all-hazard plan. You can plug in any hazard that may occur. That’s kind of how we operate,” Byard said.The EMA is not a regulatory agency. As such, it has no responsibility to ensure dams are safe. It can only wait for dam damage to be reported and prepare for the worst in the meantime. The Shelby County EMA responded when Powers' neighborhood flooded, and Byard said that if damage is found before a failure, the EMA will still respond.“If a county EMA identifies a hazard to a dam, we will definitely put an emergency plan into place. We wouldn’t sit back and wait for a failure,” Byard said.And yet, for dam safety advocates such as Mitch Reid, program director for the Alabama Rivers Alliance, the concern isn't how quickly the state responds to a disaster, but how it can prevent one altogether.“What should concern us in Alabama is no one is looking,” Reid said. “You can’t wait until a dam breach to implement a response. What I’m talking about is being able to prepare ahead of time. Saying we don’t need a dam safety program is like saying we don’t need building codes because we will respond if there’s a natural disaster.”Currently, the Alabama Department of Economic and Community Affairs (ADECA) is working to finish its own inventory of Alabama’s dams. ADECA’s Director of Communications Jennifer Ardis Elmore said the data collection began in 2009 and uses aerial imagery, topographic maps, hydrologic datasets and flood studies to assemble the tally, but none of the dams are being inspected or evaluated for safety in person due to lack of resources.Will Alabama ever have a dam safety program?There are two main deterrents preventing Alabama from considering dam safety: cost and need.Besides the cost of staff to travel, inspect dams and draft EAPs, private dam owners would have to keep their own dams up to date. Dam experts such as King said that's a cost many don't want to bear."People don't like spending money on something that may or may not occur in their lifetime," King said.California, for instance, has 700 fewer dams than Alabama, and the state budget for dam safety in 2015 was more than 13 million.The USDA currently estimates that 20 Alabama dams need to be rebuilt and 51 need repairs. That cost alone is estimated to be 24 million.Elmore County EMA Director Eric Jones is responsible for handling response should any one of his county’s estimated 32 dams fail. Jones said he’s in favor of any program that protects the public, but he also said the cost must be weighed.“I think it would be excellent to have a program that monitors these locations, and I think if it can be implemented to enhance citizens’ safety, we should certainly have it,” Jones said. “At the same time the state has to spend the dollars to get the most out of taxpayer dollars.”Former Rep. Mary Sue McClurkin, R-Indian Springs, introduced a bill in 2014 to establish a dam safety program. At the time, current Georgia Safe Dams program manager Tom Woosley was president of the ASDSO and pushed for the bill to get passed, but it foundered amid opposition and cost concerns from farming and forestry lobbyists.“You can sum a lot of it up as sort of an education issue, but there was a lot of concern that the program would negatively impact catfish farmers and people involved with forestry so there was a pretty good lobby against that,” Woosley said. “The fear of the cost, and there is cost to the dam owner to make sure the dam is being maintained, I don’t think anybody would argue with that, but the investment for maintaining the dam is a small amount compared to if something happens what the repair cost would be or if there were multiple people losing their life.”Before Jones was born, his family and the rest of Wetumpka witnessed the 1975 collapse of the Walter Bouldin Dam. Despite the massive 90-meter breach, nobody was injured and no property was damaged besides a powerhouse that was flooded.In the case of Powers and her neighborhood, the water blocked traffic and some trees were uprooted but likewise the flood caused no severe damage.Some Alabama dam safety advocates wonder if the lack of a catastrophic dam collapse is the reason there isn’t a program designed to prevent them.In 1977, Georgia’s Kelley Barnes Dam failed, killing 39 people. The next year, Georgia implemented a dam safety program.“People have to see a need for it,” Woosley said. “The Oroville Dam situation is a great example of why you need a program. For Georgia, it took the loss of 39 lives to make people aware of that. It would be helpful if it wouldn’t take something like that in Alabama before they decide to have a program.”Photos: Crisis at Oroville Dam and spillwayView CommentsView CommentsAbout Us Staff Directory Careers Accessibility Support Site Map Legals Our Ethical Principles Terms of Service Privacy Policy Your California Privacy Rights / Privacy PolicyDo Not Sell My Info / Cookie PolicyContact Us Support Local Businesses Advertise Your Business Advertising Terms and Conditions Buy and Sell Licensing & Reprints Help Center Subscriber Guide My Account Give Feedback Promote Your EventSubscribe Today Newsletters Mobile Apps Facebook Twitter E-Edition Storytellers Archives RSS FeedsJobs Cars Homes Classifieds Education Reviewed USA TODAY Sports+ 10Best Events Reach Local© 2022 www.montgomeryadvertiser.com.

Subscribe Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Copy article link Save ENNIS n The Madison River was unusually big and entirely empty of fishermen and floaters on Labor Day after a crucial structure that regulates water flow from Hebgen Dam broke Sunday. The failure at the dam's intake tower on Sunday afternoon sent water gushing from Hebgen Dam at spring runoff levels, forced evacuation of camping sites and closure of the river to recreation, and caused anxiety among Ennis residents. Bits of information mixed with rumors spread by word of mouth Sunday around Ennis, which has no local radio or TV station or Internet site to centralize reliable information. That led some residents to fear that the dam had failed, there had been an earthquake or evacuation was imminent, which turned out not to be true. "All I could envision was water coming down Main Street," said Mary Van Pelt, a sales associate at The Blue Heron gift store in downtown Ennis, who moved the store's books in case of flooding. "They kind of made us feel it was imminent…. It was a little nutty." Madison County Undersheriff Roger Thompson was reassuring Monday afternoon at a press conference held at the Madison Valley Rural Fire station. "There has been no problem whatsoever with the dam," Thompson said. "All the citizens of this county should feel very proud and happy" that the emergency response team members worked well together. He thanked about 50 emergency workers from different agencies and volunteers for doing an excellent job of mobilizing on Sunday, and declared that the emergency team was being demobilized as of Monday afternoon. County Commissioner Jim Hart thanked the emergency workers and volunteers for a "fantastic job," but conceded there had been glitches in informing the public. "This is a big deal in small town USA," Hart said. The river between Quake Lake and Ennis Lake was reopened Monday to fishing and other day uses, but not to overnight camping. Signs were to be posted warning recreationists of unusually high water. However, the river remained closed between Hebgen Lake and Quake Lake. The river may well remain high today. A battle plan for repairing the dam's intake structure was still being debated by civil engineers late Monday, said Carrie Harris, manager of hydro-engineering for PPL Montana LLC, which owns and operates 93-year-old earth-and-concrete Hebgen Dam. Harris offered reassurances about PPL's Hebgen Dam and the Quake Lake rock dam immediately down-river, which was created by a massive landslide in the 1959 earthquake that killed 28 people. The Madison River, normally flowing around 850 cubic feet per second this time of year, jumped to 3,400 cfs on Sunday, which would be a normal spring high-water, fish-flushing flow, Harris said. It's still below the 3,500 cfs maximum which PPL agreed not to exceed in a "gentleman's agreement" in its federal license, to avoid stressing Quake Lake, she said. And it's far below the 5,000 cfs that occurred in the winter of 1997. Thompson said it was a fisherman who first reported trouble at Hebgen Dam on Sunday afternoon, telling the sheriff's office he heard a loud pop and "a strange sucking sound," and saw a lot of water frothing at the headgates of the intake tower. Thompson said he and Steve Covas, PPL supervisor of the Madison Dam at Ennis, drove to the dam and inspected the water intake tower. They found a manhole cover weighing about 175 pounds had popped off and was lying 6 feet away. The intake tower is about 75 feet deep, most of it underwater. It has four gates that allow water to flow into four chambers, through the dam structure to a tunnel and out to the Madison River. Normally, only two of the four gates would be letting in water. Instead, Thompson said, they could see water churning in both chambers that should have been empty. That indicated the timber and concrete intake structure must have a breach somewhere underwater. "The flow was so high, we started evacuating from Hebgen Dam to Quake Lake, and all the way down to Ennis Dam," Thompson said. The evacuation area only involved campers or people who might be affected if the river rose 3 feet. "Ennis was never in any danger," Thompson said. "At this river level, we're not too worried about Quake Lake." However, as people who live along the river were told they might want to prepare for possible evacuation, residents became alarmed. "People started hearing rumors the dam was breaking," Thompson said. So volunteers were sent door to door in Ennis to quash the rumors, and a community meeting was called at 11 p.m., which drew about 100 people. "The biggest impact we had was not panic but anxiety over exactly what was going on," said Justin Gatewood, sales representative at Madison River Fishing Co. "The nightmare scenario being circulated was maybe the whole valley would be flooded out." Corinna Christensen, co-owner of the Ennis Pharmacy & Soda Fountain, said residents on Monday felt "relieved it's not as serious a situation as it could have been." Hillary Block, owner of the West of the Madison clothing shop, said she raised merchandise up off the floor as best she could Sunday. At her home by the river, she gathered up photos and records and took her son to stay that night at a friend's trailer. "I feel somewhat relieved," she said. "But I don't feel we're out of the woods yet. It's not fixed yet." A federal inspector was expected at the dam Monday night, said Mark Lambrecht of Helena, PPL manager of regulatory affairs. Engineers from Washington Group of Missoula were debating whether a plan to install a 17-foot-wide steel bulkhead to plug the water's outflow would work or tear up the bulkhead, according to PPL officials. Ironically, Harris said, Hebgen Dam underwent its annual federal inspection last Thursday and everything seemed fine. If there ever were a catastrophic dam failure, Lambrecht said, Ennis would have eight hours notice before the water could reach the town. Gail Schontzler is at gails@dailychronicle.com or 582-2633.

With impressive speed and brutal efficiency, all but 24 of the homes were ripped from their foundations within minutes. Five of the eleven people killed succumbed in that initial surge.“Of the 23 federally-declared disasters in Idaho history, this still stands as the only one that was man-made. As a result, the federal government paid out 322 million in claims over 11 years following that fateful day 40 years ago,” said Idaho Transportation Departmnent spokesman Reed Hollinshead.Small leaks sprung from minor holes. The holes soon became fissures; the fissures became gaps; the gaps grew into a full-blown breach.But it came not without warning.Two days before the dam broke, water was seeping at the rate of 100 gallons per minute. By the morning of the failure, the rate had increased to 50 cubic feet per second.At 10:43 a.m., workers at the dam notified dispatchers of both the Fremont and Madison county sheriffs’ offices that failure was imminent.At 11:57 a.m., the dam gave way.The first community to feel the water’s destructive power was Wilford, a community three miles wide and six miles long. The next town hit was Sugar City, then Rexburg, and then Hibbard.More than 35,000 people were evacuated from their homes. More than 800 were treated for flood-related injuries. An estimated 3,000 were made homeless — many never found a trace of their family belongings and treasures.When floodwaters hit Blackfoot miles away, 55-gallon barrels floated down Main Street. Before the flood subsided, a major shopping center and 150 homes there were under as much as six feet of water.Beyond Blackfoot, the water had no more settlements to flood, though low-lying farmland was inundated. The water came to rest in the American Falls Reservoir, more than 100 miles away. It took the water two days to reach the reservoir but, for most areas, the drainage continued for another five to six days.More than 260,000 acre feet of water spilled into eastern Idaho during the flood.“Approximately 20 miles of state highways and seven bridges were damaged or destroyed by rampaging floodwaters from the dam’s collapse,” Hollinshead stated.Eighty percent of the area's 700 miles of county roads were destroyed. Huge sections of pavement washed away and were found later in potato fields.In fact, part of U.S. 20 had to be cut in order to drain standing water from those fields.Railroad ties and rails were lifted, washed away, curved and twisted. Airplanes from the Rexburg airport were lifted and smashed. Thousands of drowned cattle were found everywhere. Buildings were destroyed and shoved off their foundations. And as the water settled, mud, inches of mud, was everywhere and in everything.Southeast Idaho District Engineer Ed Bala was in high school in Idaho Falls at the time of the flood but remembers it well.“I recall working with most everybody else in my hometown of Idaho Falls that Saturday filling sandbags on the banks of the Snake River. I also remember city officials trying to dig diversion channels around both ends of the Broadway Bridge,” he said.A channel was dug around the end of the bridge to relieve pressure. A second channel was dug around the west end of the bridge and the structure was saved.“By the time the flood reached us, it had pretty much dissipated, so we didn’t suffer damage. It was a life-altering event for people in Tetonia, Sugar City and parts of Madison County, though,” he added.The first step the Idaho Transportation Department took was to close roads in the area to combat the unpredictability of the water and the path it chose. “There was not a lot to do but wait for water to subside,” said Hollinshead.Keith Green had been ITD’s district engineer in eastern Idaho for about a year on that June day in 1976. He was in Washington at his in-law’s home when news of the flood hit the airwaves. In the initial panic, Green thought the dam that gave way was the Ririe Dam, and his home would have been in the path of the floodwaters.“If it had been the Ririe Dam, we all would have been pretty wet,” Green said.During the first few days following the flood, almost all district highway personnel stationed at Rigby were called upon to help with flood-repair operations. The full cost of repair to state highways was borne by the Federal Highway Administration from its emergency relief program.At the height of repairs, approximately 34 ITD Division of Highways’ personnel, together with seven Federal Highway Administration people, were actively engaged in flood work, Hollinshead explained.Green said a special design section, from ITD Headquarters and other districts, began work also immediately. Within two days, ITD awarded the first contract and repairs began. The second repair contract came just a few days later. The Department ultimately spent an estimated 15 million that summer and the next rebuilding the roads.“I worked on ITD survey crews in my college years (1978-1980),” Bala said. “Even then, the engineers and technicians in the office were still administering contracts to rebuild roads in Madison County.”The dam broke on a weekend, when most people were still home and able to react.Because it was warm, not winter weather, the water did not pack the destructive double whammy of being powerful AND cold. The area's communication system also gave people the chance to evacuate or at least pack some belongings.The damage and the suffering could have been worse if hundreds of volunteers hadn't spent hours filling sandbags and rushing food and water to neighbors.“Also, the more heavily populated communities of Shelley, Firth and Blackfoot had been gearing up for what they knew was coming, allowing residents to begin carrying out their belongings, and making necessary preparations,” Hollinshead said.On most of the repairs, the water washed out bridge approaches but did not damage the structures, so the Department was able to simply rebuild the roads where they tied into the bridges.Silver linings often appear in the aftermath of disaster — good things often spring from those hardships. The Teton Dam disaster 40 years ago is a case in point.The state, its people, agencies, neighbors and churches pulled together to rebuild a better, stronger southeastern Idaho.“The Idaho Transportation Department again stepped into the gap to make repairs during the disasters that struck the state decades later in the '90s (floods, blizzards and mudslides) -- and the recent response to the massive landslide in north-central Idaho this spring, which dropped 200,000 cubic yards of material on the highway near Elk City,” Hollinshead said.Green turns 80 this fall. He retired as chief engineer from ITD in 1994 after 38 years of service. He laments the heartaches and abject difficulties of that summer forty years ago, but remains somewhat wistful as he recalls that time and the collaboration of disparate agencies forced together by the emergency.“It was the most exciting time of my life,” he said.

Ratnagiri dam breach: Flooding causes 44% of dam failures in India Current Issue Download Print Archives SIGN IN SUBSCRIBE Coronavirus News In-depth Blogs Videos Book Store Africa Climate Young Environmentalist Water Ratnagiri dam breach: Flooding causes 44% of dam failures in India Tiware Dam in Maharashtra’s Ratnagiri district breached, flooded seven villages and swept away 20 people on July 2, 2019 NEXT NEWS ❯ By DTE Staff Published: Wednesday 03 July 2019 Photo: Google Earth Tiware dam in Ratnagiri breached late July 2, 2019 night flooding seven villages and swept away 20 people, according to local media reports. Maharashtra is under a devastating spell of rains, even though it’s limited to a few patches and vast areas are under drought-like conditions. The threat of floods and damages to public life and property are becoming an annual affair. The Tuesday incident brings into focus a less talked about cause of major dam breach: floods caused by extreme rain events. According to the Central Water Commission that hosts the Central Dam Safety Organisation, breaching due to flooding led to the largest number of dam failures. Around 44 per cent of total reported dam failure cases are a result of breaching, like Tiware dam. Maharashtra has 35 per cent of the country’s 5,202 dams, which is the highest among all states, according to Dam Safety Organization, Nashik. However, it has comparatively safer records as far as dam-related disasters are concerned. The Maharashtra government has an elaborate procedure to ensure dam safety. It conducts a pre-monsoon inspection before May 15 every year. Dam-ning floods Roles of dams in causing floods due to failures, and by sudden release of water after holding it to extreme level have been under scanner of late. In December 2018, the Dam Safety Bill was presented in Parliament. It is yet to be passed.  The National Water Policy, 2002 envisaged enactment of Dam Safety Legislation to ensure proper inspection, maintenance and surveillance of existing dams. A report by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) report in 2017, of the 17 states and Union territories selected for audit, only Himachal Pradesh and Tamil Nadu had carried out the pre- and post-monsoon inspection of the dams while three states had only done it partially. जल से जुड़ी सभी खबरें हिंदी में पढ़ें। Dam Failure flooding Dam Safety Central Water … Water Dams India Subscribe to Daily Newsletter : SUPPORT US We are a voice to you; you have been a support to us.

In 2015, another dam at the Samarco mine jointly owned by Vale and BHP Billiton burst, killing 19 people in Minas Gerais state and causing Brazil's worst environmental disaster.In both cases, a dam holding back a tailing pond burst, spilling torrents of sludge into the surrounding area. The reservoirs contain byproducts from mining operations known as tailings.The collapse at Vale's Corrego do Feijao mine near the city of Brumadinho on Friday, also in Minas Gerais, was not as large as the 2015 Samarco disaster, but it has proven far more deadly.Residents are seen in an area next to a dam owned by Brazilian miner Vale SA that burst, in Brumadinho, Brazil January 25, 2019.Washington Alves | ReutersBy Monday, Minas Gerais fire department officials had confirmed at least 60 people dead, according to Reuters. About 300 people are still missing, and fire officials say they do not expect to find many survivors.At the time of the accident, the reservoir contained nearly 12 million cubic meters of tailings, compared with about 50 million cubic meters during the Samarco disaster. The dam was built in 1976 and purchased by Vale in 2001. It was slated to be decommissioned and was last certified as stable in September.According to Vale, the dam's safety rating was "in accordance with the world's best practices" and exceeded standards in Brazil.Financial impact likely "significant"The disaster has created a cloud of uncertainty around Vale's business.The stock price for the ADR traded in the U.S. was down more than 2, or 17 percent, on Monday, striking a new 52-week low at 11.24 per share. On Friday, the price plunged about 8 percent.Several investment banks downgraded shares of Vale, but struck a cautious note until investigations are complete."The financial impact of Friday's dam failure is impossible to quantify at present, but it is likely to be significant. We would also expect some production disruptions and more stringent safety inspections in the Brazilian iron ore industry," investment bank Jefferies said in a research note on Sunday.Vale disclosed that judges have frozen about 2.9 billion in assets. Brazil's environmental protection bureau IBAMA and Minas Gerais have fined the company 66 million and 26 million, respectively.Aerial view of rail bridge taken down by a mudslide after the collapse of a dam at an iron-ore mine belonging to Brazil's giant mining company Vale near the town of Brumadinho, state of Minas Gerias, southeastern Brazil, on January 27, 2019.Mauro Pimentel | AFP | Getty ImagesThe company is suspending its dividend payments to shareholders and setting up a pair of independent committees to create a plan to support victims and recovery efforts and to investigate the cause of the accident."There are reasons to think that the impact on Vale could be substantial given this is the second failure in three years and the significant loss of life as a result of this event," said BMO Capital Markets. "However, with the dam independently certified as safe as recently as September 26, 2018, the impact on Vale is difficult to quantify."BMO downgraded the stock to market perform and cut its price target to 13 per share. Jefferies and HSBC knocked the stock down to hold and lowered their price targets from 18 per share to 14 and 14.50, respectively. On Monday, Macquarie Research downgraded Vale shares to neutral.TVWATCH LIVEWATCH IN THE APPUP NEXT | ETListenTVWATCH LIVEWATCH IN THE APPUP NEXT | ETListenSubscribe to CNBC PROLicensing & ReprintsCNBC CouncilsSupply Chain ValuesCNBC on PeacockAdvertise With UsJoin the CNBC PanelDigital ProductsNews ReleasesClosed CaptioningCorrectionsAbout CNBCInternshipsSite MapPodcastsAd ChoicesCareersHelpContactNews TipsGot a confidential news tip?

Search Continues for 238 MissingFebruary 01, 2019At a GlanceA mining dam collapsed in southeastern Brazil, sending a torrent of debris downstream.At least 110 people were killed in the collapse.Authorities are still searching for 238 missing people.The search for 238 people still missing after the Brazilian mining dam disaster continued Thursday as the death toll reached 110.Even though no one has been found alive since Saturday, the Minas Gerais Fire Department said it's not ready to stop searching for victims, according to the Associated Press.Brazilian authorities also have arrested five people Tuesday in connection with the dam failure, two who worked for the Vale mining company and three from a German company that inspected the dam, AP said.The collapse occurred Friday, January 25, at the Corrego de Feijao mine near Brumadinho — about 215 miles northwest of Rio de Janeiro — in the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais, Vale SA, the mining company that operates the dam said.Satellite images show an area northeast of Brumadinho, Brazil, before and after a dam collapsed and covered the area in mud.(DigitalGlobe, a Maxar company/AP)Vale said the area around the dam was equipped with eight sirens, but “the speed in which the event happened made sounding an alarm impossible” when the collapse occurred, the company told the AP.The torrent of mud filled with iron ore waste from the mines was spreading down the Paraopeba River on Sunday. Environmentalists fear iron oxide in the waste could settle on the river bed and be churned up every time it rains and contaminate the river again, AP reported. Environmentalists say the impact of the dam collapse will be felt up to 160 miles from the mining site.On Wednesday, three state and federal agencies asked residents refrain from using water directly from the Paraopeba or 100-meters (109 yards) around it. Authorities said the water presents a risk to humans and animals.When the dam broke, rescuers used helicopters to search for survivors in a huge area buried in mud."Most likely, from now on we are mostly going to be recovering bodies," said Romeu Zema, the governor of the state of Minas Gerais. He noted Saturday afternoon that those responsible "would be punished."“I saw all the mud coming down the hill, snapping the trees as it descended. It was a tremendous noise,” Simone Pedrosa, who saw the collapse from a neighborhood about five miles from the spot of the breach, told the AP.A search and rescue crew of about 130 men and women from Israel Defense Forces arrived Sunday to assist with search for survivors, according to Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus. The team left Thursday to return to Israel.Vila Ferteco, a community downstream from the collapse appeared to be the hardest hit, but evacuations were also ordered for parts of Brumadinho. The flow of reddish brown waste also hit an administrative office for the mining company.Advertisement"I've never seen anything like it," Josiele Rosa Silva Tomas, president of Brumadinho resident's association, told AP. "It was horrible ... the amount of mud that took over."Lt. Pedro Aihara, a spokesman for state firefighters, said Saturday they found a bus they believed could be filled with bodies but noted that accessing the bus buried in yards of mud was proving difficult."We need a special machine to access the structure and recover victims," Aihara said. "The number of dead is going to go up."Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro said in a speech posted to Twitter that the government was taking all "possible steps to minimize the suffering of families and victims." Bolsonaro said he planned to tour the area by helicopter on Saturday. Reuters reported that the dam held 1 million cubic meters of mining waste byproduct, much less than the 50 million cubic meters that rushed out of a deadly mining dam collapse in Minas Gerais in 2015. That collapse, at a dam also operated by Vale SA, killed 19 people and also polluted waterways with toxic waste, the Wall Street Journal reports.AP says a report from the United Nations found that waste from the 2015 disaster "contained high levels of toxic heavy metals." The 2015 collapse left 250,000 people without drinking water and killed thousands of fish.Video from social media showed widespread destruction and people trapped in a mountain of mud-choked debris. Rescue operations by land and air were ongoing. One television station showed a helicopter hovering inches off the ground as it pulled people covered in mud out of the waste.In another video cars, train cars and pieces of structures are seen tossed about the river of debris.The cause of the collapse is unknown at this time, but weather didn't appear to be a factor. The area of the collapse is below average for rainfall over the last 30 days, receiving just over an inch of rain since Jan. 1, according to senior weather.com meteorologist Jon Erdman. 1/126Arrow LeftArrow RightRescue workers in a helicopter search a flooded area after a dam collapsed in Brumadinho, Brazil, Sunday, Jan. 27, 2019.

Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox. Sign up here.Residents near a dam in southwest Virginia were ordered to evacuate early Thursday after a slow-moving storm system brought flash flooding across the region as more "significant" flooding is in the forecast.The National Weather Service (NWS) office in Blacksburg said that as of 6 a.m. Thursday, 4.61 inches of rain had fallen in Roanoke over 48 hours."It doesn't take a tropical-named storm to cause a lot of damage and flooding, and that's exactly what we're seeing here across the Mid-Atlantic for another day or so into tomorrow, into Friday," Fox News senior meteorologist Janice Dean said Thursday on "Fox & Friends."WHAT IS A CUTOFF LOW? WHY THESE STALLED SYSTEMS CAN CREATE HAZARDOUS SITUATIONSBetween 1.5 and 3 inches of rain, with some localized 4- to 5-inch amounts, fell across the region Monday afternoon into Tuesday night. Up to 5 inches, with locally heavy amounts, is forecast through Friday. Flood warnings, watches, and advisories are posted from the Ohio River Valley to the Mid-Atlantic after a stalled storm system brought heavy rain over the region this week. (Fox News)"Areas of flooding and localized flash flooding will continue or worsen today as an additional one to four inches of rain fall," the NWS office tweeted. "This will result in more water covered roads, so please Turn Around Don't Drown!" Additional rainfall through Saturday across the region. (Fox News)The stalled out system bringing the heavy rain to the Mid-Atlantic is caused by a "cutoff low," a low-pressure system that remains stationary for several days after getting cut off from the jet stream. A cutoff low is tapping into moisture across the Southeast from Tropical Storm Arthur. (Fox News)This stalled area of low pressure also is tapping into tropical moisture, which was already in place across the region due to Tropical Storm Arthur near the coast earlier this week. Without the steering of the jet stream, what is known as a "cutoff low" can remain stationary for days or even meander in any direction. (Fox News)From the Appalachians into the Carolinas, flood watches and warnings remain in effect as additional rain and runoff keep the threat of flooding through the region on Thursday. More heavy rain is forecast to impact the Mid-Atlantic through the end of the week. (Fox News)The city of Roanoke said that residents living near the Spring Valley Dam were ordered to evacuate early Monday. As of Thursday morning, emergency crews have responded to at least three swift-water rescues in the Roanoke, Va. due to flooding. (Roanoke Fire-EMS)"Due to heavy rains, the Spring Valley Dam located in the City of Roanoke near Lake Dr. is in danger of failing, which could cause flooding in the immediate area of the dam," the city tweeted.Officials said that 13 homes in total were affected by the evacuation, as personnel from Roanoke Fire-EMS were going door-to-door to evacuate residents and ask them to move to higher ground.SWOLLEN MICHIGAN RIVER CRESTS AS WHITMER, OFFICIALS WARN FLOOD DANGER ISN'T OVER YETAs of Thursday morning, emergency crews have responded to at least three swift-water rescues in the city. Swift-water rescued have been reported in Roanoke, Va. due to flooding. (Roanoke Fire-EMS)Roanoke Fire-EMS crews said in a series of tweets that crews have responded to cars getting into floodwaters, including some drivers who went around barricades."Please be reminded that barricades are in place for a reason," the agency stated. "They are there for yours and our protection."No injuries were reported as of Thursday morning from the floods in the Roanoke area. The danger for additional flooding continued Thursday, as forecasters from the NWS' Weather Prediction Center (WPC) forecasted more heavy rainfall to the Mid-Atlantic.CLICK HERE FOR MORE WEATHER COVERAGE FROM FOX NEWSForecasters warn that rainfall rates on Thursday will become "excessive," especially within bands of any thunderstorms that develop."The storm's seemingly endless supply of moisture, its slow movement, and the region's overly saturated soil are a recipe for significant flooding on Thursday," the WPC said.CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APPBesides the risk of flash floods, forecasters are also warning about the potential for landslides and debris flows in steeper terrain.The flooding in Virginia comes as Michigan faces what the state's governor called a "500-year" flood that led to the failure of a dam and evacuation of some 10,000 people on Tuesday night.

Times writer Louis Sahagun discusses the effects of a rare mega-storm with L.A. Times Today anchor Lisa McRee. The L.A. Times Today airs on Spectrum News 1, Monday-Friday at 7 p.m. and 10 p.m. By Louis SahagúnStaff Writer Feb. 18, 2019 7:55 AM PT FacebookTwitterShow more sharing optionsShareClose extra sharing options Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Email Copy Link URLCopied!Print Scientists call it California’s “other big one,” and they say it could cause three times as much damage as a major earthquake ripping along the San Andreas Fault.Although it might sound absurd to those who still recall five years of withering drought and mandatory water restrictions, researchers and engineers warn that California may be due for rain of biblical proportions — or what experts call an ARkStorm. For the record: 11:45 a.m. Feb. 18, 2019An earlier version of this story said that when scientists speak of a 900-year storm, it means that such a storm has a 1 in 900 — or .001% — chance of occurring in any given year. The percentage is .1%. (Los Angeles Times) This rare mega-storm — which some say is rendered all the more inevitable due to climate change — would last for weeks and send more than 1.5 million people fleeing as floodwaters inundated cities and formed lakes in the Central Valley and Mojave Desert, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Officials estimate the structural and economic damage from an ARkStorm (for Atmospheric River 1,000) would amount to more than 725 billion statewide.In heavily populated areas of the Los Angeles Basin, epic runoff from the San Gabriel Mountains could rapidly overwhelm a flood control dam on the San Gabriel river and unleash floodwaters from Pico Rivera to Long Beach, says a recent analysis by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.Advertisement An aerial view of the Whittier Narrows Dam in the area between Montebello and Pico Rivera.(Brian van der Brug / Los Angeles Times) In a series of recent public hearings, corps officials told residents that the 60-year-old Whittier Narrows Dam no longer met the agency’s tolerable-risk guidelines and could fail in the event of a very large, very rare storm, such as the one that devastated California more than 150 years ago.Specifically, federal engineers found that the Whittier Narrows structure could fail if water were to flow over its crest or if seepage eroded the sandy soil underneath. In addition, unusually heavy rains could trigger a premature opening of the dam’s massive spillway on the San Gabriel River, releasing more than 20 times what the downstream channel could safely contain within its levees.The corps is seeking up to 600 million in federal funding to upgrade the 3-mile-long dam, and say the project has been classified as the agency’s highest priority nationally, due to the risk of “very significant loss of life and economic impacts.”The funding will require congressional approval, according to Doug Chitwood, lead engineer on the project.Standing atop the 56-foot-tall dam recently, Chitwood surveyed the sprawl of working-class homes, schools and commercial centers about 13 miles south of Los Angeles and said, “All you see could be underwater.” Engineer Douglas Chitwood explains the workings of the Whittier Narrows Dam, which engineers predict would not stand up to a mega-storm.(Irfan Khan / Los Angeles Times) The dam — which stretches from Montebello to Pico Rivera and crosses both the San Gabriel and Rio Hondo rivers — is one of a number of flood control facilities overseen by the corps. Throughout much of the year, it contains little water.A government study, however, used computer models to estimate the effects of 900-year, 7,500-year and 18,000-year storm events. (Los Angeles Times) In each case, catastrophic flooding could extend from Pico Rivera to Long Beach, inundating cities including Artesia, Bell Gardens, Bellflower, Carson, Cerritos, Commerce, Compton, Cypress, Downey, Hawaiian Gardens, La Palma, Lakewood, Long Beach, Lynwood, Montebello, Norwalk, Paramount, Rossmoor, Santa Fe Springs, Seal Beach and Whittier. Officials say as many as 1 million people could be affected.Among the communities hardest hit in a dam failure would be Pico Rivera, a city of about 63,000 people immediately below the dam. In a worst-case scenario, it could be hit with water 20 feet deep, and evacuation routes would be turned into rivers. Downey could see 15 feet of water; Santa Fe Springs, 10 feet.In recent years, officials with the U.S. Department of Interior and the U.S. Geological Survey have sought to raise awareness of the threat of mega-storms and promote emergency preparedness. Part of the challenge, however, has been characterizing the scale of such storms. When scientists speak of a 900-year storm, that does not mean the storm will occur every 900 years, or that such a storm cannot happen two years in a row. It means that such a storm has a 1 in 900 — or .1% — chance of occurring in any given year.The estimates used by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers are intended to protect the region from a storm similar to the one that hit California during the rainy season of 1861-1862. That’s when a series of intense storms hammered the state for 45 days and dropped 36 inches of rain on Los Angeles. So much water fell that it was impossible to cross the Central Valley without a boat, and the state capital was moved temporarily from Sacramento to San Francisco. The false sense of security included in the phrase ‘900-year flood’ combined with the promises of 20th century water infrastructure have put us in a bind. — David Reid, water historian Some researchers, however, say climate change has cast doubt on 20th-century assumptions. They argue that, in a warming world, regions such as California will experience more whiplashing shifts between extremely dry and extremely wet periods — similar to how California’s long drought was quickly followed by the wettest rainy season on record in 2016-2017. These intense cycles will seriously challenge California’s ability to control flooding as well as store and transport water.Daniel Swain, a UCLA climate scientist, said hydrological and forecast data used by the corps must be updated.“The Army Corps’ estimates of the impacts of an extremely serious weather event … are categorically underestimated,” he said. “That’s because we only have about a century of records to refer to in California. So, they are extrapolating in the dark.”As an example, Swain said until recently it was thought a flood the magnitude of the 1861-1862 event was likely to occur every 1,000 to 10,000 years. New research has changed that view considerably, Swain said.“A newer study suggests the chances of seeing another flood of that magnitude over the next 40 years are about 50-50,” he said.Whittier Narrows, Swain added, is therefore just one of “many pieces of water infrastructure that may not be up to the challenge of the brave new climate of the 21st century.” Men ride horseback in the shadow of Whittier Narrows Dam, which Army Corp of Engineers officials say no longer meets their tolerable-risk guidelines.(Irfan Khan / Los Angeles Times) Such was the conclusion of a study conducted by UC Irvine researchers and published recently in the scientific journal Geophysical Research Letters. After examining 13 California reservoirs — most of them over 50 years old — the authors argued that the risk of dam failure was likely to increase in a warming climate. The study cited the 2017 crisis at Oroville Dam, when extreme water flows caused the dam spillway to disintegrate and triggered the evacuation of more than 180,000 people.In the case of Whittier Narrows Dam, Travis Longcore, a spatial scientist at USC, suggested people had grown complacent about the effectiveness of the area’s flood control system. “People tend to forget about the power of Southern California’s river systems,” he said.The San Gabriel River ranks among the steepest rivers in the United States, plunging 9,900 feet from boulder-strewn forks in the mountains down to Irwindale. It then meanders in a gravelly channel before arriving at lush Whittier Narrows — a natural gap in the hills that form the southern boundary of the San Gabriel Valley. From there, its flows are tamed in a concrete-covered channel for most of its final journey to the Pacific Ocean.Now, based on the corps’ findings, L.A. County and municipal officials are working with the federal government to develop emergency plans that can be implemented if necessary before the repair project at the dam is completed in 2026.Pico Rivera has undertaken an improved preparedness program, but only recently.Robert Alaniz, a spokesman for Pico Rivera, said the city was using a 300,000 grant from the California Department of Water Resources to revise its existing evacuation plans, which use major thoroughfares crossing the San Gabriel River to the east and Rio Hondo to the west.Separately, Los Angeles County Supervisor Hilda Solis said she discussed the importance of the Whittier Narrows Dam project with members of Congress during a visit to Washington, D.C., in January.In the meantime, David Reid, a water historian and expert on the Whittier Narrows area, suggested “the false sense of security included in the phrase ‘900-year flood’ combined with the promises of 20th century water infrastructure have put us in a bind.”“That’s because a mega-flood is impossible to predict,” he said. “And if the water infrastructure fails, we’re in big trouble.” California Newsletter The stories shaping California Get up to speed with our Essential California newsletter, sent six days a week.

For the second time in two days, he rushed to pack up his family’s belongings.“It’s heart wrenching — I never imagined a flood like this here, in the middle of the state,” said Williams, 34, an elementary school teacher, who sought shelter Wednesday at a high school east of Columbia, after a release from nearby Beaver Creek Dam. “The sheriff just warned me that if the house isn’t fully flooded yet, it soon will be.”Early Wednesday, officials had urged residents near Beaver Creek Dam to immediately seek shelter and move to higher ground.NEWSLETTER: Get the day’s top headlines from Times Editor Davan Maharaj >>A few hours later, Richland County Sheriff Leon Lott said the situation had been stabilized and residents were allowed to return home. But the flood emergency throughout many parts of the state is not over. AdvertisementWith 14 dam failures statewide and 62 more in danger of failing after historic rains pushed capacity beyond limits, much attention has turned to dam safety.Most of the water damage in the Midlands has taken place along the Gills Creek watershed, a 70-mile-long network of streams, ponds and lakes that weaves through the cities of Columbia, Forest Acres and Arcadia Lakes, as well as the U.S. Army’s Ft. Jackson.Beginning in the early 1900s, many small earthen dams were built mainly by landowners along the network to create recreational lakes. Through the decades, neighborhoods have been developed around the scenic lakes, creating storm water runoff problems, according to the Gills Creek Watershed Assn.Throughout much of the forested lands of South Carolina, there are more than 2,400 state-regulated dams, most of which are earthen dams on private property. Of those, 180 are deemed high-hazard potential, said Mark Ogden, project manager with the Assn. of State Dam Safety Officials, a nonprofit organization.When unprecedented rain struck over the weekend — with Hurricane Joaquin-fueled storms dropping as much as 20 inches of water in some areas — many of the dams were strained beyond capacity.Some experts said Wednesday that more rigorous dam inspection and oversight would have eased the flood danger. Going forward, residents need to be better prepared to evacuate in severe weather, officials need to move quicker to decide whether controlled water releases are needed to prevent breaches and dams need to be more rigorously monitored, said James H. Knapp, a professor of Earth and Ocean Sciences at the University of South Carolina.“The failure of dams has been the major part of the issues on this side of town,” said Knapp, who lives in an area adjacent to Gills Creek, where many upscale homes were submerged. “This has taken most people completely by surprise - there just wasn’t a full appreciation of the vulnerability of these dams before this rain.”Knapp said he did not understand why people living downstream of the dams had not been warned of potential breaches in advance of the heavy rainfall.South Carolina is behind other states across the country when it comes to dam safety, Ogden said. In 2014, the state reported performing only 63% of its scheduled inspections for the 180 high hazard dams.“There are certainly areas that South Carolina could improve or take a look at what they could do,” Ogden said. “The state is scheduled to inspect dams at least once every two years. You would expect 100% compliance for high hazard potential dams, but they have fallen far short of that. These are good people doing the best job they can, but they could use additional resources.” At a news conference, however, South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley pushed back against criticism that the state had not done enough to prepare dams before the storms.“One dam failure is too many, but in a situation like this we are extremely grateful for where we are today,” Haley said, praising emergency responders for working throughout the night to mitigate the damage. “This is a thousand year flood and we have thousands of dams in our state … 62 we are watching and 13 have failed. When we have floods of this magnitude, it’s really amazing that we have not had more.”Noting that the danger was still not over, with potential evacuations in seven more counties as the rain trickled down to lower parts of the state, Haley added: “There’s plenty of time to analyze this after.”ALSO:Here’s how bad the South Carolina floods areHeavy rain and flooding stun South Carolina; at least 12 people killedVolunteers turn out in force to supply South Carolina with drinking water and food World & Nation Newsletter Must-read stories from the L.A.

The dam later failed amid heavy rainfall in May 2020.

The suit is asking for 1.25 million in damages.“They could have done something, they should have done something, and they chose to do nothing,” Cathy Allen, 63, said an interview with Bridge Michigan. After floodwaters filled the Allens’ basement and rose four feet deep on the ground floor, the pair were forced to move into a hotel. Cathy’s mother, who had lived in the home with them, moved into an assisted-living facility.All told, the dam failures and subsequent flooding caused an estimated 200 million in damages to more than 2,500 homes in Midland, Gladwin and Saginaw counties.Public documents show federal regulators knew for decades that the Edenville Dam’s spillway couldn’t pass a severe flood. But while they issued increasingly stern directives to Boyce and prior owners to bring the dam in compliance, they hesitated to step in when Boyce claimed it couldn’t afford fixes.The Allens are represented by Michael Pitt of Pitt McGehee Palmer & Rivers, the Royal Oak firm behind a massive lawsuit against the EPA tied to the Flint water crisis.The lawsuit comes after the Allens filed a tort claim with FERC last year, an action that amounts to a direct request for damages from the agency.FERC Executive Director Anton Porter had denied the claim, according to documents Pitt provided Bridge. Porter argued that Boyce, not the agency, is liable for damages caused by the disaster.In an interview with Bridge, Pitt said his firm is preparing to file similar claims for nearly 400 additional clients.The lawsuit joins a host of others tied to the disaster, but Pitt said it is the first to target FERC. Other suits blame state regulators and dam owner Boyce Hydro, LLC for their role in the disaster.While the bevy of complaints filter through the legal system, an independent team is still investigating what caused the Edenville Dam to fail. Pitt chalked it up to a regulatory “merry-go-round” in which Boyce took advantage of state and federal officials’ hesitation to enforce safety regulations.As a result, he said, “people’s lives are ruined.”“Their dream houses are destroyed, their financial security is up in the air, some don’t know where they're going to go and how they're going to carry out the rest of their lives.”After decades of warnings that the dam fell short of federal safety standards, FERC regulators finally revoked the dam’s license in September 2018.That punted regulatory duties to state officials who said they didn’t know whether Edenville met Michigan’s weaker flood control standards, because FERC withheld the documents they needed to make a determination.The dam failed while state officials awaited a report that later deemed the dam deficient even by Michigan’s weaker standard.The Allens have taken out a second mortgage to cover the cost of repairing their home. Cathy’s mother will remain in assisted living, an agonizing choice the Allens made to avoid further disrupting her life.“I feel like I’ve lost my mother,” Cathy said. “The whole point of us combining households was that she would live out the rest of her days with us.”Their neighborhood, Cathy said, “is a ghost town.” Two nearby homes have been razed. Many others sit vacant. A boat the Allens bought to spend their golden years on the lake sits in dry storage.“This is not what we wanted for our retirement,” she said.The Edenville failure sparked renewed attention to the weak dam safety laws, a chronic lack of funding to fix or remove dams, staffing shortages within the state dam safety office, and regulatory hesitancy that allow hazards to fester at Michigan’s dams.Two separate review teams have proposed a host of potential solutions. A state task force report released this week included 86 recommendations, from changing state law to strengthen dam safety standards, to freeing up money to fix problem dams.Legislative leaders told Bridge they are reviewing the report.

It gave way on July 24th, 2010 around 1 PM.Cause of the dam breakA storm system, which ironically dropped the largest recorded hailstone in South Dakota on July 23rd, 2010, also led to heavy rain in eastern Iowa. By Brandon Libby By Brandon Libby By Brandon Libby Here is a look at the heavy, training storms from the morning of the July 22nd, 2010 to the morning of the 24th. Notice the continuous heavy rainfall in two separate rounds over eastern Iowa. By Brandon Libby In a 48 hour period from July 22-24, 8-12 inches of rain fell along the highway 20 corridor from Waterloo to Dubuque and areas southeast of Dubuque. By Brandon Libby This led to a quick rise in river levels and record flooding along the Maquoketa river and Lake Delhi/Hartwick Lake. By Brandon Libby This remains the record crest at Manchester highway 20. By Brandon Libby Here is a look at the Maquoketa river from highway 20 near Manchester to the dam (the rough drawing is by me). The flow goes from highway 20 toward the marked pin. By Brandon Libby AftermathAll of that water was too much stress for the earthen berm on the south side of the dam and it gave way, spilling a maximum of 69,000 cubic feet per second of water downstream, causing extensive destruction and costing millions of dollars. There was luckily no loss of life.The Association of State Dam Safety Officials put out a case study on the dam break complete with pictures and videos. You can read that here.

Those communities, which include Hesperia, Barstow, Apple Valley and Victorville, could flood if the Mojave River Dam fails, a statement from the agency said. More than 315,000 residents in those four communities in San Bernardino County, about 70 miles northeast of Los Angeles, are in the path should floodwaters overtake the dam, according to US Census data. The Mojave River Dam is an ungated flood control structure built in 1971 that is located at the northern side of the San Bernardino Mountains. Southwest of the dam, on the other side of the mountains, residents are fleeing wildfires in the region. The dam is located on the “desert” side of the mountains, so the current wildfires don’t add any risk to the flood threat, CNN meteorologist Haley Brink said. In fiscal year 2018, an assessment showed that the dam “could fail should water flow over the top of it,” a statement from USACOE said. “The change was the result of recent risk assessment findings that during an extreme flood event, water could exceed the design capacity of the dam and overtop it,” the statement said. “This could potentially result in dam failure.” Flood waters could even reach Baker, which is more than 140 miles downstream of the dam, the statement said. But it’s unlikely a storm of that magnitude would occur, Col. Aaron Barta, commander of the Corps’ Los Angeles District said. “The dam has never experienced spillway flow or a flood event that has loaded the dam significantly,” Barta said. “This is a storm that is unlikely to occur, but it is nonetheless a real possibility and one we must be prepared for.” No rain is expected in California for the next seven days, Brink said, and this particular region doesn’t get a lot of rain anyway. The rainy season, which runs from December through February, normally only brings less than 2 inches of precipitation during those three months. The Army Corps says the agency is working with local governments to help improve flood-risk awareness and emergency preparedness so that anyone in the communities threatened by the potential breach have the tools they need to survive.

Kicking off an eight-day hearing in Manchester, northern England, BHP on Wednesday called for the record group action to be struck out or suspended, alleging it duplicated Brazilian proceedings and victims were already receiving redress.Advertisement "These applications are ... brought because the attempt to export and duplicate the work being done in Brazil, including the litigation, to England, is pointless and wasteful," BHP said in legal documents. "It has no proper purpose or utility and will, if allowed to continue, inflict an astonishing burden on the court ... and these parties – without any tangible benefit to the claimants."Advertisement The hearing will establish whether the case can be tried in England, although the judge is expected to reserve judgment until around September. If successful, further trials are expected to determine liability and quantify damages. The collapse of the Fundao tailings dam, which stored mining waste and is owned by the Samarco joint venture between BHP and Brazilian iron-ore mining giant Vale, killed 19 and poured roughly 40-million cubic metres of mining waste into communities, the Rio Doce river and Atlantic Ocean, 650 km away. Claimants allege BHP, the world's largest miner by market value, ignored safety warnings as the dam's capacity was repeatedly increased by raising its height - and disregarded cracks that were early signs of rupture. Many claimants are seeking compensation for physical and psychological injury, property damage, moving costs, loss of earnings, loss of water supply and lost fishing income. BHP said the Renova Foundation, a redress scheme set up in 2016 by its Brazilian division, Samarco and Vale, has spent more than 1.3-billion pounds on projects, such as monthly financial aid to about 130 indigenous Krenak families, rebuilding three villages and establishing alternative water supply systems. It also alleged almost 100,000 of the claimants have already received payments from Renova and only 58 of the individuals, businesses, municipalities, churches, utility companies and indigenous people bringing the claim in England are not part of rival class actions in Brazil. Claimants allege it is wrong to suggest victims are entitled to full redress in Brazil because Renova lacks independence and its compensation scheme is slow, bureaucratic, inadequate and has not properly involved victims in decision-making. They allege BHP is responsible for the dam's collapse, liable for its "catastrophic consequences" under Brazilian law but that victims have no prospect of proper compensation in Brazil within any reasonable timeframe. Samarco, Vale and BHP Brasil face a raft of lawsuits in Brazil over the disaster, including a 155-billion reais (29 billion) class action filed by Brazil's federal prosecutors which, it alleges, overlaps "almost entirely" with the English case. The Brazilian class action has been suspended, although the parties plan to negotiate a settlement by 2022 at the latest.

Share Via Email Published: 28th October 2021 03:14 PM  | Last Updated: 28th October 2021 03:20 PM |  A+A A- Mullaperiyar Dam (Photo | PTI) By Express News Service KOCHI: The 126-year-old Mullaperiyar dam, which is a composite gravity dam (combination of concrete and embankment), is in a deteriorating condition due to age and it should be decommissioned to enable the construction of a new dam, Kerala submitted before the Supreme Court in a written note on Thursday. “The consequences of any failure of the dam could be extremely catastrophic and beyond human imagination. The apprehensions of the Kerala government regarding the life and safety of more than 30 lakh people in 5 districts residing downstream of the dam have to be given due importance and consideration”, Kerala submitted in the note. The state has opposed the view of the Supervisory Committee constituted by the Supreme Court that the dam would hold 142 feet of water level. The Supervisory Committee and Tamil Nadu maintain that there is no danger or threat to the dam. The Committee recommended before the Supreme Court on Wednesday that there is no need to change the water level in the dam. Kerala meanwhile added that the hearting (material used as fill) of the dam which accounts for more than 60 percent of the volume of the dam was constructed with lime surkhi concrete. Quite understandably, seismic forces were not considered in its design. In spite of the strengthening measures taken twice, the dam is in a deteriorating condition. There would be an exponential increase in water pressure and uplift pressure acting on the dam when the water level is raised from 136 feet to 142 feet. ALSO READ: Kerala launches evacuation drive as TN set to release water from Mullaperiyar at 7 am on Friday The catchment area of Mullaperiyar reservoir is 624 sq km. The gross storage capacity is only 12.758 TMC ft at 142 feet. Mullaperiyar, therefore, is exceptionally vulnerable because it has a large catchment area and limited storage capacity. Consequently, the water level in the Mullaperiyar dam increases rapidly compared to Idukki which has a catchment area of 650 sq km and a storage capacity of 70.5 TMC ft. Kerala sought to keep the water level in Mullaperiyar at 139 feet as Idukki reservoir is nearing full reservoir level and any sudden large release from the upstream dam can worsen the situation, forcing to make large releases from Idukki causing flood in downstream areas. Kerala pointed out that Tamil Nadu was not utilizing the full outflow capacity of the Mullaperiyar dam. At 137 feet, the full outflow possible is 2,735 cusecs but Tamil Nadu was drawing only 2,200 cusecs.  Which was increased to 2,300 cusecs as the water level reached 137.8 feet. Kerala pointed out that Tamil Nadu can create additional storage facilities at appropriate places in Tamil Nadu and enhance the capacity of the Vaigai dam to store water drawn from Mullaperiyar. The capacity of the existing tunnel can be enhanced or an additional tunnel can be constructed for drawing more water, which will help to keep the reservoir level at a safer level without reducing water viability as suggested by an empowered committee constituted by Supreme Court in February 18, 2010. Kerala does not demand a reduction of water used by Tamil Nadu. In fact, Kerala is requesting to use more water by adopting appropriate measures, Kerala’s standing counsel G Prakash said in the note. Meanwhile, Tamil Nadu has agreed to open the shutters and release water from the dam from 7 am on Friday. Though located in Kerala, the dam is operated and maintained by Tamil Nadu.

Niccoli Sandelin, spokesman for the agency, said officials from the California Division of Safety of Dams cleared the dam for continued use after responding to inspect the cracks.Twain Harte Lake Association will continue draining water from the lake and monitoring the dam, Sandelin said.The cracks in the granite slab, known to lake goers as “The Rock,” were discovered by first responders investigating reports of a loud “explosion” noise in the area about 10:30 a.m. Thursday.Sandelin said investigators did not find any explosive devices or evidence of explosions in the area of the dam and determined that the sound people heard was likely caused by cracking in the granite slab that anchors the dam’s southern side.Dore Bietz, the county Office of Emergency Services coordinator, said that managers with the Twain Harte Lake Association were confident that releasing the water would alleviate any concerns of a larger dam failure.The lake has a maximum capacity of 142 acre feet, or enough water to cover 142 acres to a depth of one foot.Other agencies involved with responding to the incident included the Twain Harte Community Services District, Twain Harte Fire Department, Tuolumne Utilities District, Cal Fire, California OES, the state Division of Safety of Dams, and Pacific Gas and Electric Co.It marked the third time since 2014 that cracking in the granite slab has caused concerns about a potential dam failure, though it was the first to occur outside of summer and during a storm that brought heavy rainfall and cold temperatures to the area.The first time cracking in the slab was discovered was the morning of Aug. 3, 2014, and was followed by three more subsequent events over the next month.Hikers and people near the lake at the time of the 2014 incident reported hearing loud booms and seeing a cloud of dust above the slab. Small popping noises in the areas of the cracks persisted throughout the day as officials investigated.It was determined that the cracking in 2014 was a rock stress release event, or exfoliation, which is a term geologists use to describe the natural process of pieces of granite breaking away from a larger dome.“Natural rock stress release events are caused by years of weathering of an unprotected rock surface and fluctuations in temperatures,” the Twain Harte Lake Association’s website says. “The resulting rock fractures, known as exfoliation joints, form onion-like patterns where it appears that layers of the rock are peeling away — just like an onion.”The 2014 caused damage to the left dam abutment that resulted in several cracks and a small leak.All of the water was immediately drained from the lake after the 2014 event, with the ensuing repairs to the granite slab and dam costing nearly 900,000. The project, described as the largest project ever undertaken by the association since the dam was built in 1928, was funded by a combination of the association’s reserve funds and a special assessment paid by members.In addition, the lake that serves as a significant economic driver for the Twain Harte economy was closed for the remainder of the summer that year and didn’t reopen until late June 2015.Another exfoliation event occurred on July 22, 2016, and resulted in the lake being closed for the second time during summer, though it reopened on Aug. 6, 2016, after the area was cordoned off and safety protocols were put in place.The association’s website says the dam is now monitored twice yearly by the state Division of Safety of Dams, and regular movements of the granite slab are monitored by the U.S. Geological Survey, as such natural stress release events are expected to continue into the future.Lauren Gerber, lake director for the association, could not be reached for comment on Thursday.Contact Alex MacLean at amaclean@uniondemocrat.com or (209) 588-4541.

The St. Francis Dam, which was owned by the city of Los Angeles, collapsed without warning to residents around midnight on March 12, 1928, resulting in the death of 400 to 600 people. The range is wide because a number of undocumented people who worked in the area were not accounted for. It is considered the worst civil engineering disaster of the 20th century by many. There were physical factors that led to its destruction such as insufficient stability of the base. The dam’s height was also raised by 10 feet, twice, without increasing slab thickness. Human error played a role as well. After the release of the forensic report in January, several of the contributing human factors sound eerily similar when comparing causes of failure of the 770-foot tall earthen Oroville Dam and the 205-foot tall concrete arched gravity dam that once stood in the San Francisquito Canyon, 47 miles from Los Angeles. A series of forensic investigations were conducted when the St. Francis Dam failed, concluding that human factors leading to the break included: warning signs of distress within the structure dismissed by inspectors, an overconfidence in William Mulholland, the self-taught engineer who designed the structure and oversaw construction, and also a lack of external oversight of the design and construction. Sound familiar? “In both cases, the problem was not lack of sufficient knowledge collectively within the industry, but rather insufficient awareness and application of that knowledge,” said Jon Garton, president of the Association of State Dam Safety Officials. “This highlights that there is a continued need today to learn from this failure.” After the St. Francis Dam failure, the state legislature removed its exemption for municipalities and required that all non-federal dams be reviewed by the state. The state Board of Registration for civil engineers was also established in 1929. “The St. Francis Dam failure was a pivotal event in U.S. history, in that it forced policymakers to consider their role in ensuring public safety through adequate oversight,” Garton said. In February, a bill to beef up dam safety laws introduced by Assemblyman James Gallagher of Yuba City (one of the cities evacuated during the Oroville Dam crisis) was signed into law by Gov. Jerry Brown. The bill requires annual inspections for most of the state’s dams, reservoirs and appurtenant structures, consultation with independent experts to update dam safety practices every 10 years and periodic reviews of original design and construction records.

It’s why restoring healthy, free-flowing rivers must be a top priority for Congress and the Biden administration. It’s also why we must chart a smart course for hydropower: a source of energy that may be low-emission but often comes with a high price for river health. Today, our efforts to ensure a future of healthy rivers and climate resilience took a major step forward. Representative Annie Kuster (NH-02) introduced legislation that advances the environmental, safety, and economic benefits of healthy rivers and charts a course for hydropower in our nation’s future. The bill, which provides 24.8 billion in spending over 5 years, is designed to accelerate the rehabilitation, retrofit, or removal of the nation’s more than 90,000 dams. Rep. Kuster was joined by Representatives Don Young (AK-AL), Kim Schrier M.D. (WA-08), Julia Brownley (CA-26), Jared Huffman (CA-02), Debbie Dingell (MI-12), Emanuel Cleaver (MO-05), Nanette Diaz Barragán (CA-44), and Bonnie Watson Coleman (NJ-12) in introducing this legislation today. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) will introduce companion legislation in the Senate later this month. This bill is urgent and timely, as Congress and the Biden administration consider national infrastructure legislation. Dams are a major component of our nation’s infrastructure – and many are outdated and unsafe. The American Society of Civil Engineers gave dams a “D” grade on its report card on America’s infrastructure. The failure of Michigan’s Edenville Dam last year, and the spillway breach at California’s Oroville Dam in 2017, raised the alarm about the safety of dams in the U.S. An element of the legislation is critical investment to protect the public from the ticking time bombs of unsafe dams. Edenville Dam failure in Michigan, 2020 | Courtesy of Ryan KaletoAmerican Rivers played a key role in crafting the legislation, with vital partnership from organizations including the Association of State Dam Safety Officials, American Whitewater, Trout Unlimited, The Nature Conservancy, Hydropower Reform Coalition, Low-Impact Hydropower Institute, National Hydropower Association, and others. If enacted, the bill – which is not focused on any particular U.S. dam, river or region – would restore more than 10,000 miles of rivers by enhancing their climate resilience through the rehabilitation or removal of hundreds of the nation’s most hazardous dams. The legislation would also secure the nation’s existing hydropower dams by improving their performance, resilience, and safety. Additionally, it would provide a significant investment in existing federal dams to enhance environmental performance and improve dam safety. Collectively, these efforts will support or create approximately 500,000 jobs. Key elements of the legislation include: Increase federal financial assistance to improve dam safety – 9.75 billion total over 5 years. Leverage the federal tax code to incentivize investments in dam safety, environmental improvements, grid flexibility and availability, and dam removal – 4.71 billion for a 30% Tax Credit. Create a public source of climate resilience and conservation funding for removal of dams that have reached the end of their useful life – 7.5 billion over 5 years. (Because federal hydropower dam removals require individual negotiations and usually Congressional authorization, they are excluded from this bill’s dam removal funding, but all other dams are eligible.) Invest in existing federal dams and relevant research programs to accelerate decarbonization, increase renewable power generation, enhance environmental performance, improve dam safety, leverage innovative technologies, and evaluate disposition – 12 billion over 5 years (combination of 11 billion for dam-owning federal agencies and 1 billion for research). American Rivers and our partners crafted the legislation as a complete package, and it is essential that these pieces remain whole and connected as the bill moves through Congress. Since 1912, more than 1,700 dams have been removed nationwide, restoring thousands of miles of rivers. The river restoration movement in the U.S. is stronger than ever, yet there is simply not enough funding to advance all of the projects that are needed for public safety and river restoration. With this legislation, we’re poised to supercharge dam removal – taking river restoration to the next level, with a multitude of benefits for communities nationwide. We’re also acknowledging there is a role for hydropower in our energy future, as long as we balance smart hydro with our need for healthy, free-flowing rivers.  It’s also important to note that American Rivers is unwavering in our support and advocacy for a critical river restoration effort that is not included in this legislation – the effort to remove the four dams on the lower Snake River in the Pacific Northwest, to save endangered salmon and orca. American Rivers views the Twenty-First Century Dams Act, and the effort to restore the Snake River – which we named America’s Most Endangered River® of 2021 — as top priorities and both must move forward.  We urge you to contact your elected officials and urge them to support both of these vital river restoration efforts.  TAGS: Climate Change & Rivers, Dam Removal, Energy Development, HydropowerLeave a Reply Cancel replyYour email address will not be published.

Photo courtesy of Jason Philips Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Copy article link Save Water continues to pour out of lake Dunlap, draining the lake after a spill gate failed early Tuesday morning.Officials say the lake, located in the northern portion of Guadalupe County on the Guadalupe River, will have completely drained by day’s end.“The lake levels have dropped approximately six feet,” Guadalupe-Blanco River Authority (GBRA) spokesperson Patty Gonzales said just after noon on Tuesday. “We do expect the lake to dewater later today, maybe this evening.”Water began to surge over the Lake Dunlap dam after the spill gate failed around 8 a.m. Tuesday morning, dumping water downstream at about 11,000 cubic-feet-per-second (CFS), causing river and lake levels downstream to rise.No evacuations were called, however, residents and recreationalists were advised to take precautions as the water surged down the river.“We have some initial flooding with the water surge that will even out as the natural typography mitigates that impact of that pulse,” Gonzales said. “We are asking people downstream to take precautions, tying down any recreational items and for recreationalist to be mindful of the dangerous conditions. There could be swift currents, the water flows could be approximately 2000 CFS.”Assistant Emergency Management Coordinator Bryce Houlton said GBRA was using the floodgates downstream to help control the rapid flow of water that was released to avoid any more damage.“The ones that are closer to the dam are the ones that are going to be most affected the quickest,” Houlton said. “We’re looking at, hopefully, minor stuff. We’re monitoring it and trying to keep everybody as updated as possible. The National Weather Service is looking at it as well.”As crews assessed the situation, Gonzales said the failure appears to be similar to the one that drained Lake Wood three years ago.Since then, GBRA has worked with engineers to design new gates for the river system, however, it could be costly.“The design is not yet completed, but the cost could be tens of millions of dollars for each of the six dams,” said. “So, this does create a funding issue.”It is still unclear when the flow of water will slow, Gonzales said.

Three environmental groups filed a citizens’ complaint today requesting a formal investigation into the Hebgen Dam malfunction that dewatered the Madison River for nearly 48 hours late last year. The groups filed the complaint with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which administers the hydropower license NorthWestern Energy uses to operate the Dam. Read the complaintDownload The malfunction stemmed from the failure of part of the 108-year-old dam’s outflow gate that dropped it into a mostly closed position on Nov. 30, rapidly reducing stream flows from about 650 cubic feet per second to less than 200 cfs and generating concerns about aquatic impacts. Biologists say the sudden drop killed an unknown number of trout and sculpin that were stranded in shallow channels and pools, and that brown trout eggs on the Upper Madison may have been compromised when they were exposed to freezing temperatures.

Credit: Joe Moore “This formal complaint is the means for holding NorthWestern Energy accountable for its dam’s failure, a thorough third-party investigation of impacts, and targeted action to make the river and downstream communities whole again,” Upper Missouri Waterkeeper Executive Director Guy Alsentzer said in the release. The complaint notes that Hebgen Dam also malfunctioned in 2008, when flows jumped from 850 cfs to 3,400 cfs following a failure of the dam’s intake structure. related What is NorthWestern Energy’s liability for river and wildfire damages? Could NorthWestern Energy be subject to penalties or lawsuits for dewatering the Madison River and sparking the West Wind Fire in Denton? Legal experts weigh in. by Amanda Eggert 12.13.202112.13.2021 “Two significant flow failures in fifteen years at NorthWestern’s Hebgen Dam sound the alarm call for much needed additional monitoring and redundancy to protect the river ecology and downstream economies that are directly dependent on stable outflows,” Alsentzer said. In addition to the request for an investigation into ecological impacts, the groups are calling for a review of the safety of the dam, which underwent a 40 million restoration in 2018. They’re also asking FERC to require NorthWestern to create and administer a fund to pay for ecological restoration and mitigate economic hardships experienced by local communities, which are heavily dependent on revenue from river-related recreation. “Two significant flow failures in fifteen years at NorthWestern’s Hebgen Dam sound the alarm call for much needed additional monitoring and redundancy to protect the river ecology and downstream economies that are directly dependent on stable outflows.”Upper Missouri Waterkeeper Executive Director Guy Alsentzer The complaint also asks FERC to determine and declare that NorthWestern violated the flow requirements of its license and either oversee an “alternative dispute resolution” process or appoint a judge to negotiate a settlement between the groups and NorthWestern, the South Dakota-based utility company that supplies power to about two-thirds of Montanans. In an email to Montana Free Press, NorthWestern Energy spokesperson Jo Dee Black said the company is conducting an investigation into the malfunction and is “taking purposeful steps to ensure a thorough analysis of the gate component … to understand why this relatively new part failed and to establish corrective actions.” “Since taking ownership in 2014 of 11 dams in Montana, NorthWestern Energy invested hundreds of millions of dollars into the system. Those investments have increased the generating capacity, improved fish passage through the dam system, modernized the infrastructure and provided more recreational opportunities,” she said. A FERC spokesperson said “the filing is under review at this time.” latest stories Montana Supreme Court says Legislature can’t mandate campus carry The Montana Supreme Court issued a unanimous decision Wednesday that Republican lawmakers infringed on the constitutional authority of university officials in passing a law to allow open and concealed carry on campuses. by Alex Sakariassen 06.29.202206.29.2022 For anti-abortion activists in Montana, next steps are unclear After the fall of Roe v.

County that deserves the support of people across California.The Santa Clarita Valley Historical Society is pushing for the site of the St. Francis Dam to be declared a national memorial. The designation would commemorate both the dam and the more than 400 lives that were lost when it collapsed, the worst man-made disaster in California history.The St. Francis Dam was squeezed into San Francisquito Canyon, about 20 miles north of what is now the city of Santa Clarita. Construction began in early 1925 and was completed in May 1926. Built to hold back some 12 billion gallons of water, the structure was more than 200 hundred feet tall and more than 1,200 feet wide.About two years after it was finished, on March 12, 1928, just before midnight, the dam failed. Water had saturated a portion of the foundation underlying the dam, causing “uplift,” which expanded and destabilized its main concrete structure. California has much to learn from the terrible legacy of the St. Francis Dam, particularly at a moment when disasters are once again rocking the state. AdvertisementWhen the dam gave way, it let loose a 100-foot wall of water that raged for hours through the Santa Clara River Valley, blasting through Saugus, Piru, Bardsdale, Fillmore, Santa Paula, Ventura and other communities. The torrent morphed quickly into a flood not just of water but of concrete, asphalt, railroad rails and ties, farms, cars and homes. This gargantuan flow of debris was an equal-opportunity killer.The first victims were city of Los Angeles employees. Lilian Curtis, who was several months pregnant, narrowly escaped after climbing a nearby hill while carrying her 3-year-old son. Her husband, Lyman, who worked for the Bureau of Power and Light, and two young daughters were all carried off.A 12-year-old boy named Louis Rivera experienced something similar near Castaic Junction. Awakened by the rumble of the approaching water, he managed to grab his younger brother and sister and get them to higher ground. He watched helplessly as his mother and older brother got swept away.There are dozens more stories like these. And there are no stories at all for the many victims who remain unidentified more than 90 years later.The St. Francis Dam calamity has largely been forgotten, even though it is part of a larger saga that Los Angeles cannot help but remember.The dam was built as a vital extension of the Los Angeles Aqueduct, the lifeline that continues to bring water more than 200 miles from the Owens Valley.The project was the brainchild of William Mulholland, who at the 1913 opening of his “Big Ditch” said famously of the water that came cascading through its sluice gates: “There it is, take it.”After the dam burst — an engineering failure for which Mulholland was largely responsible — he uttered a similarly terse statement during a coroner’s inquest: “The only ones I envy about this thing are the ones who are dead.”In history and popular culture (most notably in the film “Chinatown”), the main victims of L.A.’s thirst for unbridled growth are the residents of the Owens Valley, the people whose water and land the city acquired by hook and by crook.But the Santa Clara River Basin made sacrifices every bit as worthy of commemorative recognition.The St. Francis Dam calamity is an event of national importance as well. The accident imperiled the Boulder Canyon Project Act — the legislation that authorized the building of the Hoover Dam.Enter the Fray: First takes on the news of the minute from L.A. Times Opinion »To secure passage of the bill in the wake of the tragedy, California Gov. C.C. Young and other Hoover Dam boosters waged an effective campaign that the country needed more, not fewer, dams like the St. Francis. They stressed that its failure was an aberration, the result of specific engineering errors made by Mulholland. Progress in California and the American West, they argued, meant learning from — but also forgetting about — the collapse of the St. Francis Dam.Today, a different piece of legislation, the Saint Francis Dam Disaster National Memorial Act, could ensure that the episode is better remembered. The bill was passed by the House of Representatives last year. Should it pass in the Senate, where it was recently advanced by the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, it will return to the House for a second vote. Then it will need to be signed by President Trump.Living in California means living close to the beauty and power of nature. It also means understanding that we will pay a price when our supposed control of nature fails.California has much to learn from the terrible legacy of the St. Francis Dam, particularly at a moment when disasters are once again rocking the state. Congress and the president should move quickly to make the bill law.Erik Altenbernd is an assistant professor of history at College of the Canyons in Santa Clarita.

City of Santa Cruz officials do not fear the same type of damage for its drinking water storage as seen at Oroville Dam. (City of Santa Cruz Water Department — Contributed) By Jessica A. York | Santa Cruz SentinelPUBLISHED: February 21, 2017 at 7:17 a.m. | UPDATED: March 22, 2017 at 4:57 p.m.BEN LOMOND – Some 10 miles north of the city of Santa Cruz, Loch Lomond Reservoir’s maximum 2.8 billion gallons of water is held in check by the 56-year-old Newell Creek Dam. When news broke of the evacuation of more than 200,000 residents north of Sacramento near Oroville Dam last week due to spillway damages, Santa Cruz Deputy Water Director Heidi Luckenbach said she thought area residents might automatically begin to worry about the safety of their own dam. “I don’t know how many people really realize that they have a dam upstream of them,” Luckenbach said. “To the extent that this makes people think about that, because they’re seeing it in the news, it would be great to be able to share that we have a dam, but that we have all these other things in place that do ensure its safety.” Newell Creek Dam’s concrete siding has been built to a height for withstand a force five times that seen in the area’s devastating 1982 flood. (City of Santa Cruz Water Department — Contributed) As with its much larger cousin Oroville Dam, the city of Santa Cruz’s reserve drinking water supply is contained within an earthen dam that offers flood protection through a concrete-lined spillway. The spillway is about 13 feet below the top of the dam, as a measure of controlled release for flood prevention. Both Oroville Dam’s main and emergency spillways were damaged by high water flows during recent storm runoff buildup. Santa Cruz resident Stanley Sokolow was among those who questioned local safety conditions in this season of high rainfall. The city of Santa Cruz is on course to double its average annual rainfall this season, and the Loch Lomond Reservoir watershed has received roughly double the city’s precipitation. “Here in Santa Cruz County, we have had extensive damage to hillside roads due to the unusual amount of rainfall,” Sokolow wrote in an email to the Sentinel. “Could Loch Lomond dam be next?” Newell Creek Dam uses two secondary outlet drains coming out the “toe” of the dam, unlike Oroville Dam’s unlined emergency spillway. The slope around Oroville’s emergency spillway, which had not been used previously in the dam’s 50-year lifetime, began eroding when called into action last week. Spillover Plan Were Newell Creek Dam’s main spillway to suffer damage, as with Oroville’s, Santa Cruz would use its Newell Creek Pipeline, leading to the Graham Hill Water Treatment Plant along Pipeline Road, and/or a larger 36-inch emergency release pipeline to reduce the reservoir’s water level as needed, Luckenbach said. Water flow to the pipelines is controlled through a series of five gates, all of which were replaced within the past five years, she said. In January and February, the Newell Creek Pipeline experienced three leaks, the first of which forcing the city to draw from emergency backup drinking water supplies for four days and a request for customers to cull their usage. The emergency pipeline, which only has been used for routine testing thus far, has a capacity from five to seven times Newell Creek Pipeline’s, Luchenback said. Reading this on your iPhone or iPad?

So we have a lot of opportunity to go out and do inspections, both of the spillway and the surrounding. I think with Oroville, on the one side, there was noticeable subsidence,” Luckenbach said. “We have areas on both side we can do inspections on those as well, to make sure nothing is happening.” The city is in the midst of updating its emergency action plan, work Luckenbach expects to concluded before the end of the year. For now, the department looks to a plan first developed by Santa Cruz County in the 1980s, she said. Recently, the county completed its updated Local Hazard Mitigation Plan 2015-2020, with a chapter devoted to dam failure. “The losses to life and property associated with complete dam failure would be high,” the county hazard plan states. “Given the monitoring protocol at the Newell Creek, the probability of dam failure is very low.” The regulatory state Division of Safety of Dams conducts annual inspections at Loch Lomond. Additionally, the city conducts regular local monitoring of the dam, the area surrounding the reservoir, the spillway and drains known as weirs that collect any naturally escaping water that seeps through the dam, Luckenbach said. In 2009, the city conducted testing to ensure the dam is up to the latest seismic safety standards, she said. In the mid-1980s, the dam’s main spillway walls were raised to a height about five times the force of the devastating 1982 flood, according to Sentinel reports. Loch Lomond Reservoir holds a quarter of a percent of Lake Oroville’s capacity and stands 182 feet high to Oroville’s 770 feet, according to Army Corps of Engineers’ National Inventory of Dams database. Of California’s 1,585 dams, nearly 75 percent are earthen in construction. More than a third of the state’s dams were built from 1950 to 1970, federal statistics show. DISASTROUS HISTORY Historically, there have been no reported failures of the Newell Creek Dam, even after 1989’s Loma Prieta earthquake. The only significant known danger the dam has posed to the local community came in late 1960, near completion of the 1.6 million structure. On Oct. 25 of that year, four construction workers were killed, buried beneath an earth slide when a 100-foot cliff collapsed at the dam while workers drilled a hole for grouting, according to Sentinel archives. A plaque commemorating Floyd Gordon, 43, of Redding, Alton Thomas, 31, of Watsonville, Everitt McIntosh, 60, of Santa Cruz and Gerald Kenly, 30, of Santa Cruz, was installed at the dam’s commemoration ceremony in August 1961.

That is when beginning Sept. 11, 1986 the Muskegon River area experienced 14 inches of rain in a 48-hour period.The historic series of rain storms nearly caused the total collapse of at least two of Consumers three hydroelectric dams on the Muskegon River. The Hardy and Croton dams nearly were wiped out by the flood waters in 1986.Average citizens likely didn't realize how close West Michigan came to such a catastrophe but the post-flood reports and planning documents clearly showed the amount of life and property that would have been lost. A Newaygo County 2010 emergency plan for river flooding and dam failure estimates 4,293 people are at risk and 232 million in property is in the flood zone -- just in Newaygo County.Chronicle file photoA night photo of Maple Island Road at the Muskegon River on the Newaygo-Muskegon county line showing the road washed out by the Flood of 1986.If the dams fail, the path of slowly destructive waters would not only hit Newaygo and down-river residents but Muskegon Lake properties, including downtown Muskegon, also would suffer tremendous damage.Citizens and public officials still concerned about Muskegon River flooding are gathering Thursday evening for a community meeting on river flooding issues. The Muskegon River had its first significant flood last spring since the 1986 incident.Citizens will hear from a panel of officials from the U.S. Weather Bureau, Newaygo County emergency services and Consumers Energy on flood evacuation plans, Hardy and Croton dam operations and ways property owners can mitigate flood damage and protect themselves. The 7 p.m. meeting is at the Newaygo High School cafeteria, 200 East Street and the public will be able ask questions and raise concerns, according to Newaygo County Emergency Services Director Abby Watkins. Chronicle file photoThe bridge of the northbound lane of the Muskegon Causeway was nearly under water from the flooding on the Muskegon River in September 1986. If the Hardy and Croton dams would have failed, the Causeway bridges would have been washed away, post-flood studies showed.“It was extremely critical,” Consumers hydro supervisor Charlie Smith told The Chronicle in April 1987 as officials studied the near-failure of Hardy and Croton. “We can only guess at how close to failing we were. We were near out of control at peaks. We were teetering on the edge.”And if the Consumers hydro dams had “fallen off the edge,” the destruction would have been incredible, according to post-flood assessments. If the Hardy Dam would have failed, consider:• Croton Dam would have failed 75 minutes later as a surge of 47 feet of water would have hit the second dam as the Hardy Pond emptied.• The Newaygo M-37 Bridge would have washed out as a 52-foot surge of water would have hit the city eight and half hours later, threatening the city’s water supply.• At Old Woman’s Bend west of Newaygo, a 46-foot surge would have hit 10.25 hours later.• At the Muskegon County line and Maple Island Road 37.5 miles downstream from Hardy, a 19-foot surge of water would have taken out the county bridge 14 hours later.• The Muskegon Causeway between the city and North Muskegon would have been washed out 34 hours later with a 19-foot surge of water.• Finally at the Muskegon Channel at Lake Michigan, the water surge would have been 22 feet some 35 hours later, estimates show.Chronicle file photoThe boat livery on the Muskegon River at the Muskegon Causeway was surrounded by water during the Flood of 1986.At the end of the flood event from the dam failures on the river, Muskegon would have been cut off from northern Muskegon County. Bridges over the Muskegon River would have been lost at M-37, Maple Island Road, U.S. 31 and the Muskegon Causeway, leaving the nearest river crossing at U.S. 131 just north of Standwood – more than 50 miles upriver.The potential destruction way down river along Muskegon Lake is jaw-dropping. Dam failures in Newaygo County would flood the entire Harbour Towne development on the west end of the lake, creating a “channel” out to Lake Michigan that would put the entire Ovals at Pere Marquette Park under water, according to hydrological estimates.The Holiday Inn Muskegon Harbor would be flooded as the Muskegon Lake “shoreline” would be somewhere between the hotel and Hackley Park up Third Street. North Muskegon would become a virtual island as the flooding would include Bear Lake and Bear Creek, while the bridge over Bear Lake Channel also would be underwater.The B.C. Cobb coal-powered plant at the east end of Muskegon Lake would be in jeopardy of shutting down with the flood waters of the Muskegon River raging on both of its sides, emergency response studies show.“The only good thing is that in Muskegon you are downriver and you would have enough time to react,” Michigan State Police Sgt. Gordon VanGelder said in 1987. “You also have the Muskegon River flats and that provides a large spill basin.”But when emergency response personnel discuss flooding and dam failure on the Muskegon River, it is just not a hypothetical discussion. In 1986, it nearly happened.Email: dalexan1@mlive.comFacebook: Dave AlexanderNote to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission.DisclaimerRegistration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement, Privacy Policy and Cookie Statement, and Your California Privacy Rights (User Agreement updated 1/1/21.

Mining disasters also highlight the hollow promises companies make—that they can somehow engineer a “safe” mine. Last week, a tailings dam collapsed at an iron-ore mine in southeastern Brazil, killing nearly 100 people and leaving hundreds missing.  Rescue workers at Vale S.A.’s Corrego do Feijao mine expressed “little hope” of finding survivors. This is Brazil’s—and Vale’s—second major mining disaster in recent years. In 2015, a tailings dam failed at an iron-ore mine owned by Samarco Mineração S.A. That company is a joint venture between Australian BHP Billiton and Brazilian Vale S.A., two of the world’s largest mining companies. It caused a toxic mudslide and swept away the entire town of Bento Rodrigues. Called Brazil’s “biggest environmental disaster” at that time, and an “environmental catastrophe,” the Samarco dam failure killed 19 people and left a dead zone of polluted water, crippling the water supply of hundreds of thousands of residents. 2015 Samarco Mining Disaster Bento Rodrigues / Flickr Those mining tragedies follow the Mount Polley mining disaster in August of 2014. A dam at Imperial Metals’ gold and copper mine in British Columbia gave way, spilling billions of gallons of mining waste in what was called the worst environmental mining disaster in Canadian history. Three days later, 1200 miles south at the Buena Vista mine in Sonora, Mexico, 10 million gallons of mining acid spilled into the Bacanuchi River, shutting down drinking water supplies, closing schools, and affecting an estimated 800,000 people. In each of these cases, dams holding back tailing ponds collapsed—gushing toxic mining sludge and other waste into the surrounding areas. Mining companies promised it wouldn’t happen—that a modern mine with advanced technology could be engineered to withstand the inherent dangers of mining in perpetuity. But modern mines can and do fail. This one failed after only 43 years. The Samarco mine failed after only 42 years. The Mount Polley mine in Canada failed after only 17 years. And the Buena Vista mine in Mexico failed while under construction. According to Vale, the Corrego do Feijao dam’s safety rating was “in accordance with the world’s best practices” and exceeded safety standards in Brazil. The dam—built in 1976 and bought by Vale in 2001—was inspected and certified as safe in both June and September 2018. It was in the process of being decommissioned. In an interview last Sunday, Vale CEO Fabio Schvartsman stressed the company’s compliance: “We are 100 per cent within all the standards, and that didn’t do it,” he said. “I apologize for what happened. If you asked me two weeks ago if this could have happened, I would have said it couldn’t,” said Brian Kynoch, the President of Imperial Metals after the Mount Polley disaster in 2014. Just one year before the Mount Polley breach, Knight-Piesold—the designer of the failed tailings dam—praised its own engineering design for the Pebble Mine: “Modern dam design technologies are based on proven scientific/engineering principles, and there is no basis for asserting that they will not stand the test of time.” The designer of the failed dam—Knight-Piesold—is currently designing the dams for Alaska’s Pebble Mine. Tom Collier, the CEO of the Pebble Limited Partnership, claims his company’s engineers are “convinced that there will never be a failure at Pebble.” Following last week’s disaster in Brazil, three Vale employees and two contractors have been arrested. Vale says it is fully cooperating with authorities and will decommission dams similar to the one that collapsed. It also plans to donate 100,000 reais (37,350) to each family that lost a loved one. This is a woefully inadequate response to a catastrophe. Residents have reacted with shock and anger, according to ABC: “‘Vale is destroying Minas Gerais,’ said Robinson Passos, 52, who lost a cousin and friends to Vale’s latest mining disaster. ‘There’s anger, sadness, everything,’ he said, holding back tears as he surveyed the destruction.” At the time of the accident, the tailings dam contained nearly 12 million cubic meters of tailings. That’s about 100 times smaller than even the smallest tailings containment proposed for the Pebble Mine. Think of what a Pebble Mine disaster would do to Bristol Bay—its indigenous communities who rely on subsistence fishing, its 1.5 billion annual commercial fishery that supports 14,000 jobs, and the people, businesses, and wildlife that rely on the prolific salmon runs. According to a three-year, twice-peer reviewed scientific study by the EPA, a tailings dam failure at Pebble would be “catastrophic.” Mines can and do fail.  There’s no denying it.  Too often, they fail to live up to the mining industry’s assurances of infallibility.  They fail the test of time.  And when they do, they fail the surrounding communities whose residents are the inevitable victims of catastrophic containment failure. We cannot afford a tailings dam failure at the Pebble Mine. Some places on Earth—like Bristol Bay—are too special, too invaluable, too irreplaceable to entrust to the hands of an inherently dangerous mining industry. Bristol Bay is the wrong place for the Pebble Mine. About the Authors Taryn Kiekow Heimer Deputy Director, Marine Mammal Protection Project, Nature Program Want to join the fight? We're hiring.

State finds source of rural Michigan dam failureNews Sports Autos Entertainment USA TODAY Obituaries E-Edition Legals State finds source of rural Michigan dam failureAssociated PressView Comments The state says it has found the source of a dam failure in a rural area of Michigan's northern Lower Peninsula and plans to repair the structure.The Michigan Department of Natural Resource announced last month that O'Neal Lake Dam in Emmet County's Bliss Township had failed, possibly due to heavy rains. The dam located along Sucker Creek creates a body of water known as O'Neal Lake.WPBN-TV reports engineers assessed the dam after DNR crews drained O'Neal Lake and they believe water leaked beneath a retaining wall. DNR Wildlife Supervisor Brian Mastenbrook says repairs on the dam will start as soon as possible.Public land is downstream, including Wilderness State Park.

( Gary Coronado / Houston Chronicle )Gary Coronado/Staff Before anything else, Johnstown needed coffins and undertakers. There were simply too many dead for the Pennsylvania city to handle. More than 2,000 had been killed, and thousands more injured and homeless, after a catastrophic dam collapse sent a wall of water careening toward the Gilded Age mill town. The deluge picked up barbed wire, petroleum products and everything else in its path, transforming into an avalanche of sludge. Local poet Isaac G. Reed described the event as, "A week of corpses by the mile." At the time, the Johnstown Flood was the deadliest disaster in U.S history - a gruesome event eclipsed 11 years later by the 1900 Galveston hurricane. A 21st century Johnstown is in the making just 19 miles west of downtown, at the Addicks and Barker dams. Congress must act immediately to shore up the earthen berms that stand between Houston and our own week of corpses. One month has passed since Hurricane Harvey turned our lives upside-down. Nearly 100,000 homes took on water, more than 15,000 were totally submerged and the death toll has hit 70. Yet as we rebuild and dry out, part of Harvey still looms ominously on Houston's west end. The twin reservoirs hold back billions of gallons of Harvey floodwaters, the Texas Tribune reported this week, which will be slowly released into Buffalo Bayou over the next several months. The dams were not designed for this kind of long-term discharge, nor are they guaranteed to safely detain such a massive hulk of liquid. A breach would send forth a half-mile-wide wall of water powerful enough to knock homes off their foundations, Precinct 3 County Commissioner Steve Radack told the editorial board. Imagine an inland tsunami sweeping east along the Energy Corridor toward the central business district, killing upward of 7,000 people. "It's next to impossible to get people to believe the unbelievable," Radack said. If modern prose lacks the language necessary to explain the kind of hellscape a dam failure could unleash upon our city, then perhaps Mayor Sylvester Turner or County Judge Ed Emmett should consider, like Johnstown, soliciting a poet to goad Congress into action. Because that's the body responsible for funding and overseeing the Army Corps of Engineers, which built and maintains the dams. A bipartisan delegation of Houston representatives, including Republicans Ted Poe, Brian Babin, John Culberson, Pete Olson, and Democrats Al Green and Gene Green, have already responded to Harvey by proposing The Texas Flood Accountability Act of 2017, which will compel the Corps to submit a report assessing the conditions and needs of Houston-area dams and reservoirs. This is the sort of bill that should have been written back in 2009, when the Corps first designated Addicks and Barker with the worst possible safety rating and stated they were at "extremely high risk of catastrophic failure." More for youFederal claims judge takes charge of 46 lawsuits filed over Barker, Addicks flooding SHARE YOUR OPINION Here's how to submit letters and op-eds to the Chronicle It is too late for studies and delays - Houston needs action. Any Harvey recovery bill must include the funding necessary to bolster our two existing reservoirs and construct a third on Cypress Creek. Experts have pegged the bill at 500 million. That project is priority No. 1. Following close behind are 300 million to update bayou infrastructure and a whopping 15 billion for coastal storm surge protection. The cost of a new reservoir may seem hefty, but the price of a worst-case scenario on Houston's west side would be incalculable. After all, we're already paying the penalty for not investing on Houston's east side. The EPA announced Thursday that Harvey damaged the San Jacinto waste pits, washing carcinogenic dioxin and other deadly chemicals into the river. A dive team collected samples at 2,300 times the level necessary to trigger a cleanup. Environmentalists and activists have long warned that the Superfund site was vulnerable to a hurricane. If only Washington had listened. "For years we've told the EPA it's not a matter of if this area is struck by a hurricane but when," Jackie Young, executive director of Texas Health and Environment Alliance, was quoted as saying in the Los Angeles Times.

PHOTO NEBRASKA GOVERNORS OFFICE/ZUMA PRESS/NEWSCOM April 23, 2020 Jeff Yoders KEYWORDS collapse / Dam / dams / Engineering / Environment / failure / ICE / Nebraska / Safety / spencer Order Reprints No Comments When the Platte and Missouri river systems could not drain the rain and ice from the "bomb cyclone" weather event in northeast Nebraska in March 2019, the Spencer Dam on the Niobrara River was swept away and a resident that lived just below it, 71-year-old Kenny Angel, was killed in the ensuing flood.A new report on the failure by the Association of State Dam Safety Officials says dam owners and state authorities must do a better job of preparing for such ice runs on rivers in northern climates, while also finding that authorities need to collect and provide more information about the history of dams such as Spencer. The report says ice chunks, some weighing tons, clogged the gates, caused overtopping of its earthen berm and, eventually, overwhelming what remained of the run of river dam. "A major rainstorm occurred on March 13th, 2019 causing the melting of snow on the ground," says Mark Baker, principal at Dam Crest Consulting and the ASDSO investigation panel's leader. "The ground was frozen and runoff quickly swelled the Niobrara River. Ice in the river floated to the surface in large blocks, and they were carried downstream by the flood. These thousands of blocks were the size of large pickup trucks, and weighed between two and 20 tons. As obstructions in the river occurred, these ice blocks or ice rubble as we call them in the report, piled up forming ice jams, which backed up flood water."The Stuart-Naper Bridge, about 25 miles upstream from Spencer Dam, was destroyed by the ice and water flow, then the ice run damaged the Nebraska Highway 11 bridge 12 miles upstream, according to the report. The report lays out the most likely scenario based on the facts the team gathered, but no one is sure of exactly how and when the dam failed or when Angel, whose house was near a campground he managed just downstream from the dam, was swept away.Based on the information, the team says at about 4:30 a.m. on March 14, the ice run and flood entered the reservoir above the Spencer Dam. The ice rubble clogged the spillway gates, and water rose behind the dam. Ice was pushed up onto and over the crest of the dam's earthen embankment. The downstream slope eroded, and at about 5:15 a.m. two breaches formed in the dyke, and the flood and ice run continued downstream. While ASDSO maintains a database of more than 380 dam failures, Spencer Dam's history was largely absent from available data since its construction was completed in 1927. ASDSO's research discovered that the dam suffered a failure due to ice in 1935, again in 1960 and the dam's gates and powerhouse were again damaged by ice in 1966. Nebraska has close to 3,000 dams in its inventory and information beyond state inspection results is largely unknown."State dam safety programs need to be vigilant for signs of excessive workload. State governments need to adequately fund and support their state dam safety programs," Baker said.Nebraska's Dam Safety Program and the Spencer Dam owner, the Nebraska Public Power District, both agreed to the investigation by ASDSO shortly after the Spencer Dam's failure. Neither the state nor the dam owner had any input into the selection of the panel members even though the investigation was funded jointly by NPPD and ASDSO. The investigation found that the dam was well-maintained by NPPD, despite being in the process of being sold to the Nebraska Parks and Game Commission at the time of its failure. The transaction was never completed. "We found it was well maintained, but the missing piece of the puzzle that contributed to the failure was that the maintenance was being done for typical dam activities like controlling seepage, and taking care of plants that grow on the dam, bushes and trees," Baker said. "But no one was asking the question, 'well, what about ice runs? How is does the dam perform in the spring when the ice comes down the river?'"The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has created an ice manual and updates it annually, Baker said, but there isn't a lot of other guidance on how to design or modify dams to pass ice runs. Baker also noted that modifications made to the Spencer Dam in the '40s made the dam's spillway gates more narrow and exacerbated the threat of ice runs rather than mitigating it.The report also noted that NPPD personnel at the dam knocked on Angel's door and advised him to flee hours before the failure. The last two remaining NPPD employees only fled themselves when water was observed in the powerhouse hours before the dam collapsed. The report said NPPD had no communication plan for such an event and didn't have Angel's phone number, necessitating the late-night visit."That's what's identified in our report as a need [to better prepare it for ice runs]. To modify the Spencer Dam, they would have had to incur the cost, at great cost, of putting a very long, ungated structure or a spillway made of very substantial concrete that could take a massive ice run like this... This was a tragedy that this dam failed, and someone lost their life, and we want to make sure it doesn't happen again."The full report is available to the public. In addition to Baker, whose expertise is in dam safety programs and human factors, the panel consisted of Rob Ettema, a professional engineering professor at Colorado State University with expertise in ice; Martin Teal, vice president of WEST Consultants with expertise in flood hydraulics and hydrology; and John Trojanowski, president of Trojanowski Dam Engineering who brought expertise in hydraulic structures to the panel.

More Midland-area residents sue over dam breach, floodingNews Sports Autos Business Michigan Life + Home Entertainment Opinion Obituaries MICHIGANMore Midland-area residents sue over dam breach, flooding James David DicksonThe Detroit NewsView Comments Four Midland-area residents have filed a class-action lawsuit in state court against the state over its oversight  of the Edenville Dam, arguing that its actions "caused ... serious property damages and economic harm."Among claims against the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy​​​​ are that the department engaged in "affirmative acts of mismanagement and concealment in the operation of the dam, resulting in the dam's failure and the resulting damage to plaintiffs' property."The lawsuit, which seeks class-action status, was filed Friday, is at least the third suit filed related to the flood.More:First lawsuits seeking class-action over Edenville Dam failure filed in federal courtOne earlier lawsuit focuses on the dam’s owners and managers, and another includes the dam owners, its manager and the state of Michigan.This one targets just the state.The lawsuit argues that the plaintiffs' properties were destroyed and the state knew the Edenville Dam posed serious risk and endangered property. In addition, it alleges: "Defendant abused its powers in stating publicly that the dam was structurally sound when, in fact, it was unsound.Defendant concealed information and made false statements in public to hide the dangers caused by the failures in the Edenville Dam."After the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission revoked the dam's license to generate power in September 2018 due to fears it could not survive a major flood event, oversight passed to the state."Just nine days after FERC revoked the dam’s license based on years of failing to fix “structural instability, Michigan inspectors, based on a cursory inspection, ruled the dam was in “fair” condition and allowed it to continue operating," reads the suit, which was filed in the Michigan Court of Claims."The Michigan’s inspector’s report, dated October 8, 2018, was merely three paragraphs long," the lawsuit said, and in the 19 months of state oversight, "EGLE did not demand any repairs to the dam."Last week, after heavy rains, the Tittabawassee River crested at 35 feet.  The water overpowered two dams, Edenville and Sanford, and flooded towns.More:Tittabawassee crests at 35 feet: 'Never had an event like this'Plaintiffs David and Andy Krieger of Edenville claim their basement was flooded and that they lost "several" boats and two sheds along with "many chairs and tables." Jim and Margaret Sperling, the second set of plaintiffs, live on the same street as the Kriegers and faced similar issues. Jim Sperling is an Edenville Township trustee serving his third term, the suit said."Plaintiffs bring this action on behalf of themselves and others constituting a class of persons who suffered property damage and loss on and after May 19, 2020, because of the failure of the Edenville Dam, the flooding of water over the Sanford Dam, and the resulting damage and destruction of plaintiffs’ property in the ensuing floods," said the suit, which was filed in the Michigan Court of Claims.The lawsuit quotes Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who describes the dam as a "known problem," and EGLE spokesman Nick Assendelft, who noted the state's "strong concerns" regarding the dam's spillway capacity, but allegedly said a fix never moved beyond "continued conversations" about repairs in its allegations of "affirmative acts of mismanagement."The suit notes the state's limited resources for oversight: three staffers responsible for 1,000 dams."In the months preceding the flood, EGLE, despite knowing the Edenville Dam was not capable of withstanding flooding in the event of a historic flood, took several official actions designed to force the dam’s operator to increase water levels in Wixom Lake," the lawsuit claims.The lawsuit seeks to certify affected homeowners as a class entitled to pursue damages and injunctive relief. It argues that the damage is tantamount to the government taking private property.The lawsuit asks the court to declare the state's conduct unconstitutional, for an order to fix the harm, for the appointment of a monitor "who will assist in the development of remedial plans," as well as compensatory damages, punitive damages and lawyer fees.EGLE declined comment, citing the pending litigation.The plaintiffs are represented by Royal Oak-based Pitt McGehee Palmer Bonanni and Rivers.jdickson@detroitnews.comTwitter: @downi75View Comments Staff Directory Site Map Legals Terms of Service Privacy Policy Your California Privacy Rights / Privacy PolicyDo Not Sell My Info / Cookie PolicyContact Us Advertise Your Business Buy and Sell Licensing & Reprints Help Center Subscriber Guide My Account Give FeedbackSubscribe Today Newsletters Mobile Apps Facebook Twitter E-Edition Archives RSS FeedsJobs Cars Homes Classifieds Renvy.com Michigan.com© 2022 www.detroitnews.com.

The Edenville Dam failed on May 19. That caused the Sanford Dam to become overwhelmed and resulted in massive flooding in the area.The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) issued dam owner Boyce Hydro a license in 2007, despite the dam already not being in compliance with federal regulations.“We just really expected more out of the reliability for the dams,” said Dan Allen, in an interview with MLive. “We’ve been severely damaged with this. Both emotionally and physically and economically,”Boyce Hydro was hit with multiple citations over the years for not making needed repairs on the dams. Despite multiple plans to repair parts of the dam, when the FERC revoked Boyce Hydro’s license to sell electricity in 2018, the repairs still had not been made.Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy (EGLE) assumed regulatory authority for the 96-year-old dam in late 2018.The claim alleges that because the FERC issued the Edenville Dam a license without first ensuring that it could afford to make the needed repairs, it is responsible for its failure:“The collapse of the Edenville Dam on May 19, 2020 was the direct result of FERC’s failure to comply with the legal mandate to grant a license to a financially sound and competent operator who would operate a High Hazard Dam safely. If FERC had followed its mandate, the disaster would not have occurred because Boyce would not have been granted a license,” the lawsuit filing reads.The Allens claim in the suit they have suffered 1 million in property damage and 250,000 in personal injuries.The property damage to their 3,267 square foot, 3-bedroom, 2-bathroom home includes flooding in the finished basement, three to four feet of flooding on the first floor and both garages, and mud left throughout the basement, crawl spaces, first floor and garages from when the water receded, according to the filing. They lost furniture, appliances, electronics, windows, and a piano, among other items.The Allens bought the home in 2017. They said they built an addition to the home in order to provide handicap accessibility to Cathy Allen’s parents, though her father has since died. The second renovation of the home is now underway.The claim also says the Allens have experienced “significant hardships and stress” which has resulted in “emotional distress, mental anguish, various stress induced bodily symptoms, sleeplessness, anxiety and worry about their own welfare and financial stability in retirement.”Cathy Allen’s mother will have to live in assisted living until they are able to afford repairs to her side of the home, Cathy Allen said.“We need help,” Cathy Allen said. “We need financial help from the people who we feel are responsible.”Michael Pitt of the Pitt Law Firm is representing the Allens as well as hundreds of other people impacted by the Midland-area flooding. He said what happened to the Allens is exactly the type of claim the FTCA was designed to address.“When a negligent agency causes injury to persons and property, Congress has said the government can and should be held accountable,” he said in a release.The flood triggered by high rains and the failure of the Edenville Dam largely wiped out the village of Sanford, and flooded parts of downtown Midland and beyond.Midland County officials have estimated that the total damage from the flooding is upwards of 209 million. More than 2,500 homes and businesses were damaged. About 150 were completely destroyed. Few properties had flooding insurance and many weren’t located in a flood plain.The Pitt Law Firm has also filed claims against dam owner Boyce Hydro in Saginaw Circuit Court for not complying with regulatory orders to make repairs to the Edenville dam, as well as claims against EGLE in the Michigan Court of Claims.The FERC has 6 months to either grant or deny the claim. If it denies the claim or does nothing, the Allens can sue in federal district court.MORE FROM MLIVE:Gov. Whitmer came into office with bold policy plans.

Michigan pegs Midland flooding damage to be 175 millionNews Sports Autos Entertainment USA TODAY Obituaries E-Edition Legals MICHIGANMichigan puts 175M price tag on flooding damage in Midland County Keith MathenyDetroit Free PressView Comments As Midland County continues to assess more than 175 million in damage from last month’s flooding, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer plans to ask the federal government for more help.Whitmer announced Monday that she will seek from the federal government a major disaster declaration for areas of Midland County, as the staggering amount of damage from dam failures along the Tittabawassee River begins to become clear.More than 2,500 homes, businesses and nonprofits were damaged or destroyed by the floods, with estimated losses of 175 million, said Mark Bone, chairman of the Midland County Board of Commissioners. Some 150 homes were destroyed, with another 790 suffering major damage that may yet be declared total losses, he said.Probably only 8% of those affected had flood insurance, Bone said.“Most people that got flooded by this, they weren’t in a flood zone,” he said. “So they’ve lost their homes. We are taking calls every day about how we make this right with them. We are trying to figure that out.”Another 34 million in damage was sustained on public property and to nonprofit organizations, Bone said.The flooding came May 19 and 20 after the failures of the Edenville and Sanford dams along the Tittabawassee River following days of heavy rains. Whitmer called it “an event unlike anything we’ve ever seen in 500 years.”A major disaster declaration from the federal government will open up resources such as crisis counseling for those in the affected area who need it; funding for debris removal and road repairs, and low-interest loans for homeowners, renters, business owners, farmers and nonprofits, Whitmer said at Meridian Elementary School in flood-ravaged Sanford.“We know there are people that have lost everything — homes they have lived in and built up over the course of decades,” she said. “People have spent their whole lives building up small businesses in this community, who are afraid they won’t be able to overcome the damage.”Whitmer also defended having the state Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy lead an investigation into the failure of the two dams. Some have questioned the role EGLE, the state Attorney General’s Office and the Michigan Department of Natural Resources may have played in the failure of the dams. The agencies sued dam operator Boyce Hydro LLC this spring for winter water drawdowns behind the Edenville Dam on Lake Wixom the past two years, citing their impact on freshwater mussels and other aquatic life.EGLE also approved Boyce’s request in April to raise Wixom Lake’s water level almost 8 feet, to its typical summer level. That lake-level increase was completed in early May, before the torrential rains and dam failure. The state approval came despite record-high water levels statewide and several springs in a row of heavy rains, and EGLE officials earlier expressing concern over the Edenville Dam’s inadequate spillway capacity to handle heavy rains and flooding.“It’s going to take a certain level of expertise to really get to the bottom of all of the different factors that contributed to the failure of these dams,” Whitmer said. “We also know there aren’t a lot of agencies that have that kind of expertise. And so working with EGLE, with some independent investigators as a part of that, I think is the best way to move forward. So that’s what we’re doing.”Whitmer added that there will be “ample opportunity for us all to scrutinize their findings,” and that EGLE also will be asked to assess and report on dam safety overall in Michigan and the state’s regulation of it.Former lakefront residents on Wixom and Sanford lakes, impoundments created by the dams that failed last month, now live next to vast mud fields and the re-emerging Tittabawassee River. Rebuilding the dams and lakes might take several years, particularly as a tangled mass of litigation has just gotten underway. Bone said Wednesday the rebuilding of the Edenville and Sanford dams is projected to cost “200 million or more.”When asked whether she supported rebuilding the dams, Whitmer said, “I’m inclined to say yes,” but that she needed more information.“There are all sorts of ramifications from the failure of those dams that we are still getting our arms around,” she said. “That’s why I’m reticent to say precisely what the next steps need to be, and what the end goal is. But the end goal is, of course, to restore this community as well as we can to the greatness it was prior to this event.”The letter to the Trump administration requesting a major disaster declaration will be submitted by next week, Whitmer said.“This is something that is a very intensive process, where all of the information has to be collected in support of that request,” she said. “We want it to be granted, and so we’ve got to get it right. And we’re moving quickly. An incredible amount of work goes into this.”The full range of flood damage is still being assessed. Whitmer noted that in addition to washed-away and damaged bridges and roads, a number of drinking water wells throughout the region have been fouled. Providing clean drinking water for residents who need it “will have to be a part of our FEMA (Federal Emergency Management Agency) assistance that we are hoping to get into Michigan,” she said.U.S. Rep. John Moolenaar, a Republican from Midland, praised the community’s work, already started, to recover.“There’s been an effort of volunteers, people who are doing so much to keep the optimism, resilience and strength of this community looking forward, and helping neighbor help neighbor,” he said.Added Bone, “This community is a strong community. They’re ready to rebuild.”Contact Keith Matheny: 313-222-5021 or kmatheny@freepress.com.

(WJMN) – The Michigan Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has announced the draw down of the water level on an impoundment on the Net River will likely continue into 2023 following a partial dam failure in April of this year. The draw down of the 400-acre impoundment will allow the DNR to make repairs to the damaged area. DNR reports partial failure of dam on Net River in Baraga County The dam is located on the south outlet of the Net River flooding in an area managed by the DNR. Corrosion of a water control structure in the middle of the dam caused a sinkhole to develop in April earlier this year. The DNR says the upstream and downstream embankments continued to retain water behind the impoundment as they are designed to do. The dam was previously inspected in August of 2020 and was rated “fair”. The DNR says the partial failure of the dam poses no danger for humans downstream, fish, or wildlife. The DNR called the dam “low-risk” and says amount of water flowing through the structure is considered normal. “We are working through the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy process to minimize ecological impacts to the aquatic system, fisheries, wild rice resources and other values, while ensuring public safety,” said Bill Scullon, DNR wildlife field operations manager. “The water hasn’t come down much yet, but the public can expect the water to be drawn down this summer and will likely be down into 2023.” Enjoy Michigan’s great outdoors during Three Free Weekend The draw down will affect the boating access site in the area. The access site will likely either be unusable or limited to carry down only until the water level has dropped to historical riverbank width. The DNR says other nearby boating and fishing opportunities on the Net River corridor include Wide Waters and Snake Rapids. Copyright 2022 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved.

Thousands of people were evacuated to neighbouring Chapel-en-le-Frith yesterday as fears mounted that the dam could fail. Canal & River Trust, which is responsible for the reservoir, led the mission to save the clay core embankment dam after a section of its concrete apron wall collapsed following heavy rain. Speaking to New Civil Engineer from the scene yesterday afternoon Canal & River Trust principal reservoir engineer David Brown warned that there was a “very real chance” that the dam could fail. Brown explained that hours of heavy rain overnight had led to water overtopping the dam and triggered the collapse of a section of the about 1.29M.m³ reservoir's concrete spillway. “The problem is the enormous amount of rain we have had in the last 24 hours or so,” Brown said. “We have had so much water going over the top that it has taken part of the concrete wall away with it.” He added: “While there is a very real chance that the dam could fail, unless we are very unlucky I think we should be able to save it. “We are currently working with the emergency services to try and bring the water level down.” Whaley Bridge was evacuated after the Environment Agency warned anyone along the Goyt Valley that there was an "immediate risk to life" as a result of water coming from the Toddbrook reservoir. Work to reduce the level of the dam by 2m to 3m included opening up reserve areas of the reservoir as well as diverting nearby rivers away from the reservoir. Meanwhile, British Dam Society chair Alan Warren told New Civil Engineer that this was the worst incident the UK has experienced in relation to dam failures in the last decade. "The dam has been there a very long time, and I am unsure how many times it has had to deal with such a vast amount of water," Warren said. Historic problems The Toddbrook dam construction comprises mainly boulder clay with sands and gravels. There is doubt about the existence of a puddle clay core even though it is shown on the original construction drawings. The dam is founded on fluvio-glacial sand and gravels, glacial till overlying a faulted sequence of mudstones, sandstones and shales of the Millstone Grit Series and Lower Coal Measures Complaints about leakage into mine workings have been documented since 1880. In 1930 leakage was observed at the toe of the downstream slope. Investigations into the subsequent discovery of a depression on the upstream slope in 1931 led to works to reinstate the area. In November 1975, at a time when the reservoir was low, a depression appeared in the same position on the upstream face as the 1931 depression. In Autumn 1977, monitoring revealed 120mm of subsidence against data from 1975. Workers emptied the reservoir to allow inspections into the full extent of the depression and revealed an around 4m wide crater at the upstream toe, partly infilled with silt and into which a tree appeared to have been sucked. Extensive investigation included boreholes, sampling and piezometers. Exploratory shafts were sunk on the upstream and downstream faces between 1978 and 1980. In 1981, investigations revealed a 1.2m diameter masonry culvert beneath the dam, possibly for stream diversion during construction. Tracer tests showed this to have formed a leakage path through the dam. In 1981, a compacted clay blanket was placed over the suspect area of the upstream toe and the bed of the reservoir. To solve the leakage problem, a single row grout curtain 60m long within the clay core was formed using the tube-à-manchette system. The reservoir was refilled in December 1983. "There has been a great deluge of water and that has overflown into the auxiliary spillway which is where the problem is. "It is unclear how many times that spillway has been used in the past or when it was last used." He added: "At the moment it is unclear what caused the concrete to collapse, once we are confident the dam is secure there will be an investigation to determine if there was a void beneath the concrete panel or what caused the partial collapse." The incident is the first major threat to a dam's stability in the UK since the Ulley dam suffered severe scour amid the floods of 2007. The impact of those floods were felt widely and led to a major review by Sir Michael Pitt that made sweeping recommendations around water management. Reservoirs over 25,000m³ in England and Wales are today subject to stringent checks and reservoir panel engineers are some of the most skilled and revered civil engineers in the industry. Such reservoirs undergo inspections at least every 10 years by skilled panel experts who set out safety measures to be undertaken within set time limits and subsequently certify that those works have been satisfactorily carried out.

I see from the EA’s “Guide To Drawdown Capacity For Reservoir Safety And Emergency Planning” that the installed emergency drawoff capacity should allow the level to be reduced by around 300mm to 600mm per day. I have read that Toddbrook’s drawoff facilities were refurbished after a complete emptying of the reservoir a few years ago. Are these facilities in use?

Tragedy followed.The images show how the Curtis Road bridge just south of the Edenville Dam was virtually scraped away, as was the M-30 bridge that ran north-south between the Edenville Dam and the Tobacco River to the west.In the aftermath of the flood, both Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and a U.S. House committee have ordered investigations into the dam failures.(Note: Drag black line to see before and after photos. Mobile phone users can get fuller images by turning phones horizontal)Edenville Dam, Wixom LakeFor decades, federal regulators told the owners of the Edenville Dam (to the right in photo) that it needed to expand spillway capacity at the dam to meet a potential threat from heavy rains.The photo shows how the existing spillway, lower right, performed as expected during the rains, creating a pathway for high water to safely flow downstream. The problem was there wasn’t enough capacity. For years, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission found the dam did not have enough spillway to accommodate a major flood and FERC demanded two additional spillways to the west to act as safety valves to protect the region from flooding.But the owners of the dams, most recently Boyce Hydro Power LLC, never added the spillways, prompting FERC in 2018 to revoke its license to generate and sell electricity from the dam. Oversight then reverted to Michigan, but state regulators had not decided on a new design before the dams gave way May 19.To the right (north) of the dam is Wixom Lake, formed by the damming of the Tittabawassee River. To the left (west) is the Tobacco River. Edenville is just south of the dam and about 17 miles northeast of Midland.Sanford DamDownstream of the Edenville Dam, the Sanford Dam took the shock of the upstream failure and it too failed, sending water into the town of Sanford where many homes were destroyed and damaged.The water flowed right down West Saginaw Road, the town’s business district and the surrounding neighborhood.The town is at the base of Sanford Lake, which runs north to the Edenville Dam. It is 9 miles northwest of Midland.Curtis RoadJust south of the Edenville Dam, Curtis Road takes traffic west toward Clare and east. The western approach to the bridge was wiped out.The Tittabawassee River overflowed its banks, sweeping around the bridge and eliminating some of the roadway.

that occurred in the town of Bento Rodrigues, Brazil, when a dam unleashed a wall of muddy wastewater on the area.(Image via NASA)A deadly dam failure that sent wastewater from an iron ore mine downstream into a Brazilian town earlier this month was visible from space, as NASA has revealed in a pair of photos.The before-and-after images have been animated at the top of this page to show just how much of the sludge filled the town of Bento Rodrigues, killing at least nine people, according to Reuters. Nineteen remain missing two weeks after the disaster, and 500 others were displaced, the report added.The volume of tainted water turned loose over more than 300 miles of rivers is about 60 million cubic meters, the equivalent of 25,000 Olympic swimming pools, the Reuters report also said.(MORE: NASA Gives Pluto a Psychedelic Makeover)AdvertisementThe two images in the animated photo at the top of this page were captured by the Operational Land Imager (OLI) aboard Landsat 8. The image that shows the land before the dam break was taken on Oct. 11; the image that shows the flooding was taken on Nov. 12.Environmental FalloutThis dam failure had, and will continue to have, far-reaching impacts on the environment, as well as the residents who live near the waterways filled with this contaminated sludge. Two weeks after the collapse, some 250,000 people still don't have access to clean drinking water, Think Progress reported.Mining giants BHP and Vale have been held responsible for the failed dam, and the BBC reported the pair of corporations has been fined 260 million for the mining accident, which is believed to be the worst in the country's history. That fine will be used to help those affected by the environmental disaster and also to clean up the area flooded by the sludge, the BBC also said.MORE ON WEATHER.COM: Colorado Mine Waste Leak1/22Arrow LeftArrow RightPeople kayak in the Animas River near Durango, Colo., Thursday, Aug. 6, 2015, in water colored from a mine waste spill.

Several roads in the town were washed away and over 600 people were with out power. This is where water from the Hadlock Pond flood waters raced toward State Rt. 149, Farm To Market Rd., and washed out an overpass on Rt. 149, closing the road. The process has begun to try to declare the area a disaster area, to make it eligible for Federal funds. (sp. corr) Photos for daily news coverage with a Jordan story.LUANNE M.

The Appellate Division of state Supreme Court ruled unanimously to overturn an earlier lower court ruling that the town could not be held liable for the dam failure because the work had been done by design and construction firms that the town had hired. More than 120 homeowners sued after the town-owned earthen dam, then barely two months old, gave way completely on July 2, 2005, draining the 220-acre man-made lake in mere hours, and leaving downstream homes with serious damage and lakefront homeowners on a sea of mud. In June 2010, a jury divided financial blame for the collapse, with the town being assessed at 23 percent. The construction firm, Glen Falls-based Kubricky Construction Corp., was assigned 45 percent of damages. The firm appealed a lower court ruling that had lifted responsibility from the town. "The potential harm to those living and working near the dam in the event of its failure is of great public concern, and in our view, responsibility is fairly placed with the town," according to the appellate court decision. As part of last year's verdict, the firm that designed the dam, HTE Northeast, of Bedford, N.H., was found responsible for 27 percent of the damage.

(WWBT) - Fluvanna County officials are monitoring McIver Lake Dam after it was notified that there was an imminent failure.Officials said the privately-owned dam and lake are not easily accessible by vehicle. Around 2 p.m. on March 21, the county was notified “of an imminent dam failure in the southern region of the county.” As of Monday evening, Gov. Glenn Youngkin invoked a section of Virginia’s code that allowed the county to take all the necessary actions to alleviate the imminent failure of the dam. “Pumping apparatus has been on-site since midnight last night, pumping at approximately 1,000 gallons per minute. Additional pumping equipment is headed to the site to aid in remediation efforts,” a release said. Property owners in the area have been told about the situation. As of Tuesday morning, the dam is still holding. Copyright 2022 WWBT. All rights reserved.Send it to 12 here.Want NBC12’s top stories in your inbox each morning?

The weight of the tree and the resulting water pressure may have led to the spill gate’s failure.The lake is 12 miles west of Gonzales, or about an hour’s drive east of downtown San Antonio.People who live in the area, like Christina Price, say they are now concerned about the lake’s future.“This is home, you know, my son learned how to fish on this lake, my other son learned how to swim, this isn’t just a lake, this is our home,” Price told KSAT.It’s been six weeks since the spill gate failure and the lake’s appearance has taken a drastic new look.Price said just a couple of months ago, she and her family were swimming in areas of the lake that are now completely dry.AdLocals in the area say it is also impacting the ecosystems, wildlife and possible endangered species along the 14-mile stretch of river.Frank “Five” Williams Davis V, 7, who’s grown up on the waters of Lake Gonzales says it’s his favorite spot and something needs to be done and fast.“Catfish, gar, bass, anything in this slew that’s a fish, that has to have water to breathe is going to die,” said Williams Davis.GBRA engineers did not return a request for comment when we asked about what they are doing to fix the spill gate.Their website says options for repairs have not been available and there have also been challenges with funding and state activities at the dam have been stopped for safety reasons.“There are solutions out there, it’s just GBRA not wanting to sit there and sit down with us so that we can all come to a conclusion on what we can do to move forward and go past this,” said Price.AdPeople in Gonzales say they will continue to fight to restore the lake and the wildlife in the area.“The bass are trying to stay alive while they can, you can see them jumping in the background,” said Williams-DavisLocals are expected to host a series of meetings in the upcoming weeks to discuss solutions.The Lake Gonzales spill gate failure is just the latest in a string of problems for the lakes east of San Antonio.In 2019, a dam failed at Lake Dunlap and a few years earlier, the same thing happened at Lake Wood.Dam failure is a serious concern across Texas as funding issues have left a quarter of the more than 7,000 dams regulated by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) without adequate maintenence, the Texas Observer reported just a month before the failure of Lake Dunlap’s dam.AdA sobering line from the magazine’s investigation: “Of the approximately 300 dam failures in Texas since 1910, half have occurred in the last nine years.”RELATED: Aerial footage shows what’s at stake for 4 GBRA lakes as deal postpones drainingCopyright 2021 by KSAT - All rights reserved.About the Authors:Jonathan CottoJonathan Cotto is a reporter for KSAT’s Good Morning San Antonio.

(WKRN) — A Flash Flood Warning has been cancelled in Putnam County, according to the Emergency Management Agency after a dam failed Friday afternoon. Putnam County EMA said there are no additional impacts expected for the county, but Industrial Drive remained closed to through traffic while crews worked in the area. Flash flooding became possible Friday evening in areas below Perdue Farms in southeast Putnam County and northeast White County after an earthing dam failed. Putnam County Emergency Management Director Tyler Smith said about 20 feet of water drained out of a 17-acre lake located around Perdue Farms and that water was running toward US 70 in Monterey. Putnam County dispatch reported the failure around 5:47 p.m. The Flash Flood Warning was lifted as of 9:00 p.m. (Source: Bing Maps) County Executive Denny Wayne Robinson said the majority of the water should disperse before getting into White County. “Northern White County should be alert for rapid rise in the water level but luckily we should not have to expect a destructive wall of water coming through,” Robinson posted on Facebook Friday evening. “Please be alert if you are or know someone that is on the Calfkiller.” Copyright 2022 Nexstar Media Inc.

Lewisville Dam: The dam called trouble The Dallas Morning News Sandbags and tarps have been deployed in an attempt to prevent further erosion of a 160-foot-long slide on the Lewisville Dam. To engineers, the slide’s proximity to another major one that happened in 1995 suggests instability that could threaten the dam’s foundation. NORTH TEXAS The Dam Called Trouble The Army Corps of Engineers will need millions of dollars to repair the Lewisville Lake Dam, one of the nation’s most dangerous. A breach could put 431,000 people in harm’s way. By George Getschow | Special Contributor Photos and video by Nathan Hunsinger | Staff Photographer Published December 12, 2015 The problem — one of many — first appeared as last May’s record rainstorms quickly filled the region’s reservoirs. An instrument at the Lewisville Lake Dam showed pressure building under the downstream side. Jason Vazquez, dam safety program manager for the Army Corps of Engineers at the time, collared another engineer, and in pelting rain they raced to the affected area, officially known to the Corps as “Seepage Area No. 1.” Even during the seven-year drought, the area had looked like a swamp, covered with chest-high cattails and weeds. Corps technicians sometimes encountered water moccasins and alligators as they measured seepage. This time, Vazquez and his partner, wearing rain slickers and rubber boots, spotted something far more disturbing: water and sand bubbling up from a tiny hole in the ground. Advertisement Such a “sand boil” indicates that increasing seepage has created a passage under the base of the dam. If not stopped, it could lead to a rupture of the dam. Vazquez remembers standing in the middle of the swamp, soaking wet, wondering whether the dam he nicknamed “Trouble” was about to become a regional disaster. The 35-year-old engineer called his bosses at the district’s Emergency Operations Center in Fort Worth. An alligator snapping turtle rests in the marshland of “Seepage Area Number 1,” on the downstream side of Lewisville Dam. During last May’s rains, a “sand boil” appeared in the area, indicating increasing seepage that, if not stopped, could lead to a rupture of the dam. From bad to worse Even before last spring’s rains, the Lewisville Dam was listed by the Corps as the eighth-most-hazardous in the country. Recent rains have made it worse, the Corps says. The dam is so unstable now that the Fort Worth District is considering asking Corps headquarters to upgrade its risk classification to the highest: “critically near failure” — that is, “almost certain to fail under normal operations … within a few years without intervention,” according to a Corps document. The Corps finished building the dam in 1955 and is responsible for its safety and upkeep. Only 34 miles upstream from Dallas, the Lewisville Dam holds back 2 million acre-feet, or 2.5 billion tons, of water when the lake is full. If the dam failed, the magnitude of all that water unleashed from Lake Lewisville down the Trinity River would dwarf the worst dam disaster in American history. That would be the Johnstown, Pa., flood of May 31, 1889, which occurred after several days of pounding rain breached the South Fork Dam. The flood killed 2,209 people and devastated the city. The Lewisville Dam holds back 125 times as much water as the South Fork Dam. Only 34 miles upstream from Dallas, the 6.2-mile-long Lewisville Dam holds back 2.5 billion tons of water when the lake is full. That’s 125 times as much as the dam that failed in Johnstown, Pa., in 1889, killing 2,209 people in the nation’s worst flood. ‘Very high risk’ to cities The public hasn’t been told the full story about the Lewisville Dam. Internal documents make clear that the Corps has known about its “high risk of failure under an extreme event” for many years. In 2008, a group of Corps engineers and analysts from outside the Fort Worth district performed an in-depth assessment of the dam and discovered some hair-raising defects: seepage under the foundation was creating pressure and uplift conditions at one end of the dam. Related Coverage Editorial: Army Corps needs to square with region on Lewisville Dam dangers There were signs of embankment instability during “extreme loading conditions” — Corps-speak for a rapidly rising reservoir. The emergency spillway suffered from erosion and structural distress. The team of Corps analysts concluded that “the likelihood of failure from one of these occurrences ... is too high to assure public safety” and that the dam posed a “very high risk” to the population centers downstream from the dam. That is, Lewisville, Coppell, Carrollton, Farmers Branch, Irving, Las Colinas, Dallas and points south. The analysts’ findings were corroborated by another study the following year at the Trinity Regional Project Office of the Corps adjacent to the Lewisville Dam. This new team of engineers and analysts identified “significant potential failure modes … with respect to the project condition and the potential downstream consequences,” according to a Corps document. But what the Corps tells itself about the Lewisville Dam is different from what it tells the public. “We want to get the message out that there’s a potential for something bad to happen, but we don’t want to unduly panic the public,” says an official involved in the communications. “So we sugarcoat the message a bit.” For example, starting in 2010, the Corps began holding public meetings with residents and officials from the communities downstream to discuss the Corps’ plans “to improve safety” at the Lewisville Dam. In public meetings and press releases, Corps officials stressed that the dam was not in imminent danger of failing and was operating as designed. At a public meeting at the Medical Center of Lewisville in 2013, Corps officials acknowledged the uncontrolled seepage, the potential instability of the emergency spillway and embankment and other “areas of concern.” But they assured the public that the Corps had implemented a number of temporary risk-reduction measures to address the problems while pressing ahead with further studies to determine the best methods to fix it. “Dam failure is not likely, not at all,” Anita Branch, a project engineer for the Corps’ Fort Worth District, reassured the gathering in Lewisville. ‘Indicators of distress’ Tell that to Jason Vazquez. During the height of the record rain storm last May, as floodwaters began filling the Lewisville reservoir, Vazquez and his field operations team spent days and nights, flashlights in hand, walking up and down the dam, looking for what the Corps calls “indicators of distress.” Four other dams in the district were also placed on a 24-hour watch for about six weeks in May and June. The higher the water rose in the reservoir, the greater the pressures on the Lewisville Dam. Vazquez and his operations team knew that the structural integrity of the dam was already compromised. Under the intense loading on the dam, the unspoken question among the team of inspectors walking back and forth along the rain-soaked contours was, Would it hold? Vazquez thought it would, but he and his operations team had to be prepared in case it didn’t. A storage system is used to measure seepage flowing under the Lewisville Dam. Excessive seepage can eventually form a pipe, or cavity, to the reservoir, often leading to complete failure of the dam. So when an instrument reading showed pressure rising at Seepage Area No. 1 — the same area where Corps specialists had worried for years that excessive seepage could cause a rupture or blowout — Vazquez and another engineer dashed to the boggy area. That’s when they spotted the sand boil. Clearing away tall cattails and weeds with a weed-whacker to get a better view, Vazquez was shocked. It looked like a small whirlpool spinning and spouting from underground. Now he had a major emergency on his hands. Once a sand boil starts, it’s hard to stop. A sand boil indicates that excessive seepage is starting to erode soil material from the downstream slope or foundation of the dam through to the upstream side to form a pipe, or cavity, to the reservoir. The condition, called piping, often leads to a complete failure of an earthen dam. After he called his bosses at headquarters, Vazquez directed his field operations team to place a one-layer ring of sandbags around the sand boil, allowing the pool of water inside to rise about six inches. The method is supposed to equalize the pressure and prevent the water and soil particles from expanding. By now the entire Corps was on high alert. Corps officials notified the Texas Division of Emergency Management, a branch of the Texas Department of Public Safety in Austin, as well as emergency officials downstream. Emergency coordinators prepared to begin evacuations in their communities. “We had our Swift Water Rescue Team ready and had staff on hand to deal with everything,” says Jason Carriere, Irving’s emergency management coordinator. “The sand boil was just one of many emergencies we had to deal with during that period of heavy rains and flooding.” The Corps also informed the water departments in Dallas and Denton that depend on Lewisville Lake for drinking water that if the boil progressed, it would have to conduct an emergency draw-down of the lake to relieve the pressure. Evacuations called off The sandbagging worked. The boil, which had surfaced May 17, subsided in a matter of days. And the evacuations were called off. Vazquez credits the Corps’ exhaustive training programs — which emphasize that a rapid response to a sand boil can prevent piping from progressing into a breach — for his operation team’s success in dealing with the potential catastrophe. But the troubles at the Lewisville Dam were far from over. On June 23 some of the same members of the operations team who dealt with the boil spotted another disturbing sight: a giant hole on the upstream face of the embankment, 160 feet long and 23 feet wide. It looked as if someone had detonated a bomb. Giant boulders covering the embankment, called rip-rap, had come tumbling down, along with a section of the asphalt road along the crest of the dam. The Corps calls it, simply, a “slide.” But there are two very different types of slides. One, a shallow slide, is typically a few feet deep to as much as 40 feet deep. The other is a deep-seated slide, typically 50 feet to 100 feet deep and sometimes extending down into the foundation of the dam. The massive slide at the Lewisville Dam, which is not yet repaired, is adjacent to an earlier major slide that happened in 1995, suggesting to engineers instability within the embankment. And as wave after wave of pounding rainstorms sweeps across North Texas, some engineers say the new slide could develop into a deep-seated slide, threatening even the dam’s foundation. Advertisement Adrian Espinoza, a 52-year-old construction worker, had heard about “the giant hole in the side of the dam” from fellow fishermen who had finagled a way to get their bass boats launched on the lake even with the boat ramps closed by high water. Their stories about the slide sounded like fish tales to Espinoza. But when the boat ramps reopened about two months later, he decided to see for himself. The stories, it turns out, weren’t myth. “It’s a monstrous hole that’s awfully close to the reservoir,” says Espinoza, who maneuvered his 18-foot bass boat to shore to get a closer look. “Somebody’s covered it with plastic tarps, sandbags and wooden crates. But if we get another round of heavy rain and the reservoir fills up, the dam could go.” The Corps maintains that the slide doesn’t pose an immediate risk of catastrophic failure. Right now, the hole doesn’t extend into the foundation. Moreover, the Corps says it has devised a way to repair the slide even if rainstorms fill the reservoir again. The solution: a cofferdam, a watertight enclosure pumped dry to enable heavy-duty construction work below the reservoir’s waterline. The cofferdam “will prevent any further damage to the dam,” says Sarwenaj Ashraf, who was recently appointed the district’s dam safety program manager, succeeding Vazquez. The Corps has awarded a 6.4 million contract to repair the slide. The work will begin in early January, and the repairs are expected to be completed in the spring. Preventing a slide Yet preventing another massive slide at the Lewisville Dam may not be as easy as fixing the last one. For one thing, engineers say that the 13.2 million cubic yards of fine-grained soil and clay used to build the 6.2 mile-long embankment shrinks during droughts and swells during rains, reducing the slope’s shear strength. In layman’s terms, that means the embankment is brittle when it’s dry and spongy when it’s wet. Corps engineers also say the embankment is more unstable since the May flood because cracks have spread along the 20-foot-wide crest of the dam. In fact, the Corps believes that “desiccation cracking” at the crest of the dam caused the earthen slope to collapse and slide. The Corps says heavy rains in mid-May and early June filled the 1- to 3-inch-wide cracks, saturating the soil underneath and vastly increasing its weight. Gravity took over from there. “That mass [of saturated soil] sitting on top got heavier than the material next to it, and that’s when that mass slid,” says Ashraf. Dramatic shrinking and swelling of the embankment during the rapid drought-to-deluge cycle may also account for another deformity that the Corps spotted on the upstream face of the dam after the May rains: a large, bowl-like depression in the slope across from Seepage Area No. 1. The depression would be hard to spot without the bright orange cones the Corps put out along the top of the dam to mark its location and to see if it progresses into an active slide. Corps engineers say the same soil properties that make the Lewisville Dam’s embankment susceptible to slides provide a level of resiliency against catastrophic erosion through the foundation, a situation that threatens other dams around the country. Workers deploy sandbags and tarps to temporarily prevent further erosion along a 160-foot-long slide in the Lewisville Dam. Corps engineers say the embankment is more unstable since the May flood because cracks have spread along the 20-foot-wide crest of the dam. Taken together, the increased seepage, the boil, the piping, the progression of cracking, the slide, the depression and other signs of serious distress since the last flood have convinced Corps safety officials that it’s time to consider asking national headquarters in Washington, D.C., to reclassify the Lewisville Dam. It is currently ranked as Dam Safety Action Class 2, with “very high” risk and “failure initiation foreseen.” But the Corps is weighing whether to raise this to Class 1, the category for dams that are “extremely high” risk and “critically near failure” and require immediate action to avoid catastrophe. 431,000 in harm’s way For the last four years, while Vazquez served as the district’s dam safety program manager, avoiding catastrophe at the Lewisville Dam has been at the forefront of his mind. He studied the inundation maps and consequence data for all the district’s dams. If they failed, where would the water go? How many people would be flooded out? How many killed? When he looked at the data for a breach at the Lewisville Dam, he couldn’t believe his eyes. It showed 431,000 people in harm’s way. The Corps has prepared maps of the inundation area and casualty estimates but won’t release them to the public on orders from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. The Corps also will not release a list of its top 10 high-hazard dams in the country because it might “open the public to security risks from those that could use the information to do harm,” according to a spokesman. Standing atop the crest of the Lewisville Dam last February, his eyes fixed on the Dallas skyline, Vazquez grew silent as he thought about the catastrophic consequences of a breach. “I think about it a lot,” he says. With a full reservoir behind it, a 65-foot-tall flood wave traveling 34 mph would quickly inundate a wide swath of Lewisville, Coppell, Carrollton, Farmers Branch, Irving, Las Colinas and other communities bordering the Trinity River. The wave would sweep everything in its path — the Lewisville dump, water treatment plants, LBJ Freeway, the Bush Turnpike, Interstate 35E, the State Highway 121 Tollway, Love Field, the Hospital District, office complexes, senior citizen centers, shelters, schools, playgrounds and 53,000 other structures. Like a tsunami, the wave would submerge downtown Dallas in roughly 50 feet of water, the Corps estimates, causing more than 21 billion in property damage, before continuing south down the Trinity River toward the Gulf of Mexico. “It would be a much bigger magnitude to the Dallas area than Hurricane Katrina was to New Orleans,” says Vazquez. “It’s a nightmare scenario.” Dhruv Pandya, assistant director in charge of the city of Dallas’ flood control system, peers at a photograph of the lake’s inundation area that he keeps atop his desk as a reminder of what would happen if the dam breached. “That keeps me on my toes all the time,” he says, pointing to the apocalyptic image. If the dam were to break, a 65-foot-tall flood wave would sweep through the brush to the homes and buildings beyond, swamping LBJ Freeway, the Bush Turnpike, Interstate 35E, Love Field, the Hospital District, senior centers and schools. Downtown Dallas would be submerged in 50 feet of water, the Corps of Engineers estimates. A few years ago, Pandya says, Dallas set up a contingency Emergency Operations Center outside of downtown Dallas because its current center would be underwater if the dam breached. The Corps has not been idle, either. Over the last several years, it has implemented what it calls “interim risk reduction measures” to stave off a dam failure at Lewisville while at the same time preparing for the worst. For example, the Corps has drilled about 10 new relief wells in Seepage Area No. 1 to relieve pressure and prevent further piping under the dam. The new wells supplement dozens of wells and seepage collection systems already on site. The federal agency has also stepped up emergency training exercises with officials downstream and urged them to set up an early warning system to alert residents if the dam begins to fail. It’s also built up its stockpiles of sandbags, pumps and other emergency materials to prevent a small-scale breach from mushrooming into a catastrophic one. The Corps has also changed its water control plan to allow for a much higher volume of water to be discharged from the reservoir to reduce the pressure on the dam during heavy rains and rising pools. But as residents downstream from the dam learned last May and June, releasing more water from the dam to prevent a breach can greatly exacerbate flooding. As the Lewisville reservoir rose above the top of what the Corps calls its “conservation pool” — 522 feet above sea level — during the spring rains, the Corps began releasing millions of gallons of water, flooding roads, parks, apartment buildings and businesses. After another deluge two weeks ago, the reservoir rose more than eight feet above the conservation pool, putting it just two feet below the emergency spillway. Advertisement Whenever the dam is endangered by heavy loads, the Corps says, protecting it assumes a higher priority than the consequences of downstream flooding. The Corps points out that the Lewisville Dam has prevented 31.2 billion in flood damage since it went into service in 1955. “It’s a balancing act between maintaining the integrity of the structure while also minimizing flood damages downstream,” says Vazquez, who spent weeks on his BlackBerry coordinating with the state’s Emergency Operations Center on emergency releases at Lewisville and the district’s other lakes. Vazquez recently accepted a job as senior engineer for dams and locks for Arcadis NV, a global design, engineering and management consulting company based in Amsterdam. A permanent fix The Corps says it’s working as fast as it can to come up with a permanent fix for its badly distressed dam. It plans to make its decision in the next six months. The Corps is weighing a wide range of options, including constructing a “cut-off wall” from the crest of the dam deep into its foundation to stop the flow of seepage. Workers throw sandbags and lay tarps to prevent further erosion of the slide on the dam. Corps of Engineers officials say a more permanent fix would cost between 50 million and 500 million. Another option is building a gigantic earthen berm over Seepage Area No. 1 to tamp down uplift pressures near the “toe” of the dam, where the downstream face meets the ground surface. In fact, the Corps has already been removing utility poles in the area in case it decides a berm is the best option. As for embankment instability, the Corps is examining flattening and strengthening the slopes with reinforcing material. “We're looking at different designs, different methods,” says Ashraf, “to come up with what fits the problem best.” Rehabilitating the aging dam, which is now well past its design life, won’t come cheap. Corps officials estimate repair costs between 50 million and 500 million, depending on which method or methods are chosen. Dallas and Denton, Lewisville Lake’s principal water users, are obliged under existing water supply contracts to share some of the costs of operations, maintenance and repair of the dam. Denton’s share is considerably less than Dallas’. As the Corps ponders what to do about fixing the dam, fishermen like Espinoza are nervously watching the weather forecasts to see if El Nino stirs up another onslaught of rainstorms across North Texas, wreaking havoc on the Lewisville dam once again. “Let’s just hope we don’t have another deluge like the last one,” Espinoza says.

Design flaw caused Mount Polley dam failure: report | CTV News Home FOLLOW ON Advertisement VANCOUVER Design flaw caused Mount Polley dam failure: report The Canadian Press Published Friday, January 30, 2015 10:18AM PST Last Updated Friday, January 30, 2015 7:23PM PST Share: Reddit Share Text: VICTORIA -- The construction of a mine tailings pond on top of a sloped glacial lake weakened the foundation and was akin to loading a gun and then pulling the trigger, a report on the disaster says. A government-ordered report released Friday said the spill that gushed 24 million cubic metres of mine silt and water into nearby lakes and rivers in B.C.'s Interior was caused by an inadequately designed dam that triggered the disaster. The tailings dam at the Mount Polley mine burst without warning at 1 a.m. last August 4, hours after workers had been at the foot of the structure. Norbert Morgenstern, chairman of the panel that investigated the spill, said evidence indicates there was a glacial lake deposit under the foundation of the dam. "The design did not take into account the complexity of the sub-glacial and pre-glacial geological environment associated with the perimeter embankment foundation," he told reporters gathered for the release of the report. Morgenstern, who's a geotechnical engineer who has worked on 140 dam projects worldwide, said not taking that glacial lake into account and building on a weak layer was like loading a gun. "But if constructing unknowingly on this upper (glacial) deposit constituted loading the gun, building with a steep slope ... pulled the trigger." Morgenstern said the two factors together constituted the root cause of the failure. He is among a panel of three geotechnical experts appointed by the province a few weeks after the disaster to investigate the cause of the collapse and the role of government regulation and oversight. B.C. Mines Minister Bill Bennett said Friday that his government would act on the report's recommendations. He told reporters that some changes would be made immediately, including that mines with the same dams have the foundations of their tailings ponds checked and that those mines establish independent tailings dam review boards. "This obviously was an unprecedented, disastrous event that we must do everything we can to make sure it never happens again." Bennett said. The report also indicted that the failure was set off by construction of the downstream rockfill zone at the steep slope. There was no indication that the dam was about to give way and no evidence that the failure was due to human intervention or so-called overtopping of the embankments, the report said. Last month, B.C.'s chief inspector of mines allowed the owner of the mine, Imperial Metal Corp. (TSX:III), to start repairs on the tailings pond. The main concern for reconstruction was to ensure that increased water flow from melting snow this spring won't cause further environmental or human-health impacts, the chief inspector said. A report released in November said the cleanup from the dam's breach will take many years to complete. The gold and copper mine near Williams Lake, B.C., about 600 kilometres northeast of Vancouver, remains closed. Bennett couldn't say if or when the mine would reopen, but added that he realized many people in the Cariboo region want the mine to operating again. "We are going to take the time that is necessary to review the application we have from the company and certainly the use of the existing tailings-storage facility is not something that is planned for any time soon." The minister said the government will wait for the results of two more reports before it will even consider the use of the existing tailings pond..

Dam near Sabetha in danger of failingNews Sports Entertainment Lifestyle Opinion Best of the Best USA TODAY Obituaries E-Edition Subscribe Dam near Sabetha in danger of failingBrianna Childers bchilders@cjonline.comView CommentsView CommentsThe Nemaha County Sheriff's Office announced Thursday a dam located 1 mile south of Sabetha was in danger of failing, but Nemaha County emergency manager Russel Lierz said failure wasn't certain."It's releasing water but not a complete failure at this time," Lierz said late Thursday afternoon. "We don't know when exactly it will fail and how much will be released between now and the failure. We feel there is a possibility of it failing but we are not an imminent threat."Lierz said the dam has been releasing water since Tuesday morning, and the water level is currently about 35 feet."There's a large hole on the back side of the dam, so at this time we don't have a crystal ball to look in," Lierz said. "We just can't predict exactly what it's going to do."The large hole won't be repaired until more water drains, Lierz said.The alert was posted on the sheriff's office Facebook page and said the possible dam failure would cause flash flooding downstream on the Delaware River.Earlier in the day, the National Weather Service issued a flash flood warning for the areas of east-central Nemaha County, northeast Jackson County and southwest Brown County that indicated dam failure could affect areas including US-36 highway and the Kickapoo Indian Reservation.But in a news release Thursday evening, the Kansas Department of Agriculture said maps indicate that if the watershed dam south of Sabetha were to fail, agricultural lands would be flooded, as well as County Roads 220 and 250. The maps do not show that water would extend over US-36 highway or other areas with significant residential or commercial development, KDA said.The KDA said its Division of Water Resources and the Kansas Water Office had been monitoring the situation at the dam since early Tuesday and that no significant change had occurred since then."KDA-DWR and KWO are in communication with the Kansas Division of Emergency Management and would work with them to notify residents if any significant risk were to exist to residents downstream," the news release said.View CommentsView CommentsCareers Staff Directory Accessibility Site Map Legals Our Ethical Principles Terms of Service Privacy Policy Your California Privacy Rights / Privacy PolicyDo Not Sell My Info / Cookie PolicyContact Us Support Local Business Advertise Your Business Advertising Terms and Conditions Buy and Sell Licensing & Reprints Help Center Subscriber Guide My Account Give FeedbackSubscribe Today Newsletters Facebook Twitter E-Edition ArchivesJobs Cars Homes Classifieds Reviewed.com 10Best Reach Local© 2022 www.cjonline.com.

All told, the task force identified funding needs totaling more than 420 million over 20 years. Recommendations also include ways to hold private dam owners financially responsible for keeping their dams safe.Continuing to underinvest in dam safety, the report stated, “is a violation of the public trust, a path that leads to tragic losses of property and life and is ultimately more expensive to Michiganders.”Among the task force’s dozens of recommendations: Change state law to require surveillance and monitoring plans for all high and significant hazard dams.Create a revolving loan fund to provide money for dam improvements, maintenance and removal, along with a grant program for scoping or design of projects to fix or remove dams.Create an emergency fund so state officials can fix hazards at dams if the dam owner can’t or won’t pay for repairs. Find more money to “substantially enhance dam removal.” Require dam owners to prove they can pay to safely operate and maintain or remove their dam, and require them to have insurance that could cover the cost of a catastrophic failure.Increase inspection frequency for high and significant-hazard dams.Change state law to meet the federal standard for design floods, and increase the state’s authority to step in and address dam safety issues.A host of other changes to Michigan law to improve dam oversight and give state regulators access to information about federally-regulated dams that they currently lack. You can read the full report here. State leaders, the task force concluded, “must take meaningful action to advance all of the recommendations — the potential human and economic costs of business as usual are too great to ignore.”In a statement Thursday, Liesl Clark, director of the state department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy, said the agency is “moving forward with changes we can make.” That includes hiring three dam safety engineers. But many of the task force’s recommendations require legislative action. Task force member Bryan Burroughs, executive director of Michigan Trout Unlimited, a conservation group, said he expects the recommendations to serve as a template for future legislation. Action, he said, is “imperative.”“This problem has been evolving and getting worse for a long time,” Burroughs said. “If we can’t decide to get on top of this problem and start working on it now, shame on everybody later when a couple years from now another dam goes and somebody loses their life.”'In a statement, Senate Environmental Quality Committee Chairperson Rick Outman said he’s “eager” to review the recommendations “so we can work together to make sure something like this never happens again.”Whitmer convened the task force last year, after the Edenville and Sanford dams collapsed May 19 amid heavy rainfall following years of warnings from federal and state regulators that Edenville’s spillway could not withstand a large flood.The failures devastated the Midland area, flooding downstream communities and forcing 11,000 people to evacuate, while causing 200 million in damages to more than 2,500 structures.Michigan regulators had taken control of the Edenville dam in September 2018, after the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission revoked the permit dam operator, Boyce Hydro, LLC, to generate power. That decision followed decades of increasingly stern warnings to Boyce that it needed to bring the dam into compliance with federal flood safety standards. Because Michigan’s dam safety standards are half as strong as the federal standard for high-hazard dams like Edenville, that created new problems. State regulators weren’t sure whether Edenville met the state’s threshold. The dam failed while they were awaiting a report that later concluded Edenville fell short of Michigan’s standards. State task force members indicated other dams pose pressing safety concerns of their own. Michigan’s more than 2,600 dams represent “an aging inventory that requires comprehensive and immediate attention,” they wrote.The report’s general thrust is similar to that of an October report by an independent review team with the Association of State Dam Safety Officials. That group concluded that Michigan’s dam safety program is underfunded, understaffed, and suffers from a “culture of minimal enforcement.” Related Articles: Report: Going off script, decisive action saved lives during 2020 dam disaster May 6, 2022 | Mike Wilkinson, Kelly House in Quality of Life Who’s at fault for Midland dam failures?

The slow-moving system made landfall on Monday in the Florida Panhandle. NOAA via AP Updated at 11 a.m. ET Alberto is pushing deeper inland after making landfall in the Florida Panhandle on Memorial Day, causing flash flooding, mudslides, downed trees and power outages through parts of the South, East and central U.S. and prompting officials to warn of a possible dam failure in North Carolina. The dam at Lake Tahoma in Marion, N.C., east of Asheville, was given the all-clear on Wednesday morning, after worries of an imminent collapse triggered a mandatory evacuation until an engineer could perform a safety inspection. The emergency has been canceled and the evacuation order was rescinded, McDowell County Emergency Management said in an update. Even with that reprieve, flooding and mudslides shut down highways in the mountains of North Carolina, west of Charlotte. The N.C. Department of Transportation said Wednesday that even heavy trucks had been swept away by water. Just to illustrate how serious the flooding is in western NC: Water swept an NCDOT tandem dump truck off the road overnight in McDowell County. Two people were rescued. Stay off the roads and avoid flooded areas. If you see standing water, turn around. https://t.co/pLCADeCNJN pic.twitter.com/EnDSZmuoVM— NCDOT (@NCDOT) May 30, 2018 The Charlotte Observer writes: "Shortly before 10:30 p.m. Tuesday, a mudslide closed both directions of Interstate 40 in McDowell County, according to McDowell County Emergency Management. No people or cars were trapped, according to a 10:26 p.m. tweet by Jeff Crum, chief meteorologist with Spectrum News North Carolina. 'Details are subject to change as a better understanding of the unfolding situation is clarified by EMA folks in McDowell County,' he added." Flash flood warnings were issued for several other western counties in North Carolina, with the National Weather Service cautioning that resulting landslides and rapidly rising waterways have created a life-threatening situation. Separately, the NWS forecasts that the Catawba River, which runs west of Charlotte, will crest at 18 feet above flood stage by 7 a.m. Wednesday. Various Western North Carolina counties' emergency services were taking half-hourly readings of the river where it flows by residential areas, according to Matt Bush of Blue Ridge Public Radio in Asheville. Although Alberto, the first named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, was downgraded to a subtropical depression soon after it made landfall on Monday, its affects have continued to be felt, even at the fringes of the system. Among other things, it has left 25,000 people in Alabama without power. Our campground site here at River Breeze in marion is completely underwater.

About 150 miles northeast of San Francisco, Lake Oroville is one of California’s largest man-made lakes, and the 770-foot-tall Oroville Dam is the nation’s tallest. By The Associated PressPUBLISHED: April 19, 2017 at 9:55 p.m. | UPDATED: April 19, 2017 at 9:59 p.m.By ELLEN KNICKMEYER and MICHAEL R. BLOOD, The Associated Press OROVILLE, Calif. — Late in the afternoon of Feb. 12, Sheriff Kory Honea was at the emergency operations center for the tallest dam in America when he overheard someone say something that stopped him in his tracks: “This is not good.” Over six straight days, the operators of the Oroville Dam had said there was no immediate danger after water surging down the main spillway gouged a hole the size of a football field in the concrete chute. But now suddenly they realized that the dam’s emergency backup spillway — essentially an unpaved hillside — was falling apart, too, and could unleash a deadly torrent of water. Honea reacted by ordering the immediate evacuation of nearly 200,000 people downstream. In the end, after frantic action by the dam’s keepers, catastrophe was averted. But an Associated Press examination of state and federal documents, emails obtained under public records requests and numerous interviews reveal a sequence of questionable decisions and missteps, some of them made years ago, some of them in the middle of the crisis. Among other things, the dam’s federal and state overseers overestimated the durability of the two spillways. And in public statements during the emergency, they failed to acknowledge — or perhaps recognize — that while they were busy dealing with one crisis, they were creating a possible new one. During the darkest hours of the emergency, the fear was that if the hillside collapsed, “it was not whether people would die, but how many would die,” Honea recalled. State water officials have defended their handling of the crisis at the 770-foot-high (235-meter) dam in the Sierra Nevada foothills 150 miles (241 kilometers) northeast of San Francisco, saying it was managed as effectively as possible under extraordinary circumstances, including one of the wettest winters on record. William Croyle, acting head of the California Department of Water Resources, likened the spillway failures to a car getting a flat tire or running out of oil. “This happened. Stuff happens,” he said last month. The crisis began Feb. 7 with the rupture in the main spillway. Dam managers responded by obtaining an uncommon exemption from the Army Corps of Engineers to bypass a rule that would have required them to release huge amounts of water from the rapidly filling dam. Water releases down the main spillway were scaled back drastically, sometimes to zero. Engineers did this because they wanted to inspect the hole, study how much bigger it might get and think of a way to keep the spillway from crumbling further, state officials said. All the while, the reservoir behind the dam kept rising, reaching the highest level in the structure’s history, because of one of the biggest storms in two decades. Dam managers repeatedly assured the public there was “no imminent threat.” Just 12 hours before water began running down the hillside on Feb. 11, they told Honea in an email that the water releases, though reduced, “will still keep the lake from spilling over the emergency … spillway.” Not long after the water started going down that spillway, it began ripping away the hillside. That triggered the sheriff’s evacuation order, which was quickly endorsed by the dam’s managers, who said the emergency spillway could fail within an hour. “They were futzing around with the main service spillway that had broken. They turned off the flow and were inspecting it and testing it,” said Ron Stork, senior policy adviser with Friends of the River, an environmental group. “And all of the time the reservoir was filling.” “And then it failed,” Stork said of the emergency spillway. “And you know, they almost lost control.” It was the first time in the history of the 50-year-old dam that the emergency spillway was used, but not the first hint it might be inadequate. “There’s always been an understanding that, man, you don’t want to use that emergency spillway, because when you do, it’s going to be a mess,” said Jerry Antonetti, a retired engineer who was a construction inspector for one of the dam’s power plants when the dam was built in the 1960s. Friends of the River and other environmental groups had argued as far back as 2005 that the earthen spillway needed to be reinforced with concrete. The Department of Water Resources and local water agencies said that was unnecessary. In 2014, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission not only affirmed the safety of both spillways but also said there was no point in studying or discussing the possibility that either could fail, state water officials told the AP. Ultimately, the spillways broke apart while handling just a fraction of the water they were designed to carry. As families from the Gold Rush-era towns below the dam fled their homes, Oroville Dam’s managers finally ramped up water releases down the damaged main spillway, bringing the reservoir back down to safer levels. The main spillway kept eroding but handled the flow. Local officials downstream said the dam’s operators failed to keep them fully informed as the emergency unfolded. On Feb. 7, when word started spreading that a big hole had opened in the main spillway, Honea’s dispatchers called state water officials to inquire, and were told that the state was doing only “routine maintenance inspections,” according to the sheriff. In an email a day before the evacuation, Mark Sorensen, the city administrator of the small town of Biggs, about 25 miles from the dam, told the state agency that the state “earned a grade of F on its ability to timely and completely communicate during this incident.” State officials are expanding efforts to inform the public, but say there have been dozens of news briefings, updates and advisories. Department of Water Resources officials said during the crisis that they were primarily worried that the hole in the main spillway would grow larger and take out power-line towers at the dam’s hydroelectric plant. After the evacuation, however, agency spokesman Ed Wilson said the main concern was that the hole could take out the release gates, too. That could lead to devastating flooding downstream. A federally ordered investigation is underway. In the meantime, the spillways will need hundreds of millions of dollars in repairs before the fall rainy season. Rick Poeppelman, chief of the Army Corps’ engineering division for the region, said his agency and the state water managers made the best decisions they could. “It’s kind of the hindsight thing,” he said. “The expectation was that the emergency spillway was going to be able to pass.” On Wednesday, a group of U.S. House Democrats called on the auditing arm of Congress to review dam safety standards. “The Oroville Dam failure did not come without warning,” they said in a letter to the Government Accountability Office. The group that includes six House members from California said a changing climate raises risks for aging dams around the U.S. Meanwhile, the environmental groups Wednesday renewed their request with federal regulators that the earthen, backup spillway be armored with concrete. They also urged more transparency and communication from the government.

Texas draining four lakes as aging infrastructure faces catastrophe | The Texas Tribune Skip to main content Donate Newsletters Events Audio Data Menu Close Donate Newsletters Events Audio Data Key coverage Texas Abortion Law Plan B San Antonio Truck Deaths #TribFest22 These dams needed replacing 15 years ago. Now Texas will drain four lakes instead — causing other problems. Two floodgate failures on 90-year-old Guadalupe River Valley dams — and the plan to lower the remaining four — are highlighting Texas' underfunded, aging flood infrastructure. by Chase Karacostas Sept. 10, 201912 AM Central Copy link Republish The dam at Lake McQueeny, near Seguin, is one of four remaining in the Guadalupe River Valley in Central Texas that are at risk of failure. Credit: Miguel Gutierrez Jr./The Texas Tribune SEGUIN — Texas officials will start draining four lakes next week in Guadalupe County in Central Texas without a plan in place for when the lakes, and the 90-year-old dams that support them, will be rebuilt. Area homeowners, who got barely a month's notice, said they felt blindsided by the plan, and they say it will slash their property values, kill their beloved century-old cypress trees and render the lakes — which have hosted water skiing tournaments for decades — unusable. But Guadalupe-Blanco River Authority officials say they don’t have a choice. The dams, two of which have already had catastrophic failures, are creating a safety hazard that could flood entire neighborhoods if they get any worse, river authority spokeswoman Patty Gonzales said. River authorities were created by the Texas Legislature to manage and conserve water resources around the state. Stay in the loop The next time news breaks, hear about it first. Follow The Texas Tribune on Facebook and Twitter. Facebook Twitter “We cannot guarantee the safety of the public with these aging spill gates” and have to lower them, Gonzales said. The dams are set to be lowered starting Monday. This is a familiar story surrounding water infrastructure all across the state. Flooding in South Texas last year and Hurricane Harvey in 2017 exposed gaps across Texas in the state’s flood protection systems, which experts say are often underfunded and allowed to decay for decades past their lifespans. In the Guadalupe River Valley, 40 miles northeast of San Antonio, six hydroelectric dams built in the late 1920s and early 1930s created Lakes Wood, Dunlap, Placid, McQueeney and Gonzales, as well as Meadow Lake. They were only supposed to last about 75 years — and that was 15 years ago. Because the dams don't produce much hydroelectric power, their main function now is to hold up the four lakes that are lined with hundreds of homes and are used daily for recreation, including water skiing tournaments. Water skiers are a common sight on Lake McQueeney near Seguin. Credit: Miguel Gutierrez Jr./The Texas Tribune Without the dams, the lakes turn into shallow rivers. That's already happening on Lake Dunlap, where one of the dam floodgate failures occurred. Small islands on some of the lakes soon might disappear as the water around them recedes. Beyond the loss of lakefront status, the properties that line the reservoirs are also at risk of long-term damage. The docks on Lake Dunlap, without water to support them, are slowly falling down into the riverbed. Hunter Croan built his home and dock after moving to the area five years ago and is already experiencing foundation problems less than three months after Lake Dunlap's center floodgate failed. Six-foot-long cracks now line his sinking concrete dock. "A friend of mine lost his whole wall. It just went 'woosh' down over there. It was a brand new wall," Croan said. First: A row of boat launches sit over land on Lake Dunlap. The structures used to sit over the lake until recent dam failure caused the lake to recede. Last: Hunter Croan's home on Lake Dunlap near New Braunfels. Croan's boat launch used to sit on the water, but lake levels have receded since the recent failure of a nearby dam. Other homes are likely to experience similar problems if the dams aren't fixed soon, area real estate agents said. Lack of funding for repairs is largely to blame. Because the dams aren't use for flood control, the river authority isn't eligible for state funding to maintain them and has struggled for decades to scrape together the cash to do so. (The Guadalupe River Valley dams don't produce enough electricity to be self-sustaining.) As a result, river authority officials have done just enough maintenance on the dams to ensure they function, but it hasn't been enough to prevent floodgate collapses on Lake Wood in 2016 and Lake Dunlap in May. After the second dam failure, Gonzales said, the river authority scrambled to figure out its options. Damage and flooding from the first two floodgate collapses was minimal, but with four dams left, officials are worried further failures could flood neighborhoods and put people on or near the lakes in danger. Residents say they recognize the need to replace the dams, estimates for which range from 70 million to 180 million, and that the river authority lacks the money to do it. But Tess Coody, who lives near Lake McQueeney and has helped organize community efforts to stop the river authority from draining the lakes, said most people don’t trust that the dams won't simply be abandoned after they are lowered, especially since river authority officials knew for years that the dams had exceeded their expected lifespans. Coody said she also felt the river authority's last-minute decision to lower the floodgates doesn't take into account the widespread impact it will have, including decreased property values that could hurt school districts or damage lake ecosystems.

Credit: Miguel Gutierrez Jr./The Texas Tribune Some estimates show the region potentially losing millions of dollars in property value, sharply cutting into the budgets for the Navarro and Seguin school districts, according to appraisers and real estate agents in the region. But right now, appraisers are trying to avoid the area because of the potential, but not surefire, chance of the lake draining. Many appraisers don't want "to take that kind of a risk on something we have no way to prove," said Doug Hendricks, an appraiser who has worked in the area for decades and owns Hendricks Appraisal Services. He added that any appraisal would have to include acknowledgement of loss of the lakes. The most extreme estimate puts the property value loss at 50%, which he said sounded reasonable based on previous knowledge of the area, but it would be hard to know for sure until sales occur. As for environmental impacts, residents say the 100-year-old cypress trees lining the lakes are at risk of dying without being partially submerged in the lake water, and even daily watering might not be enough. “If someone's having like kidney problems, you can't just throw out a kidney transplant without thinking about what's at issue here,” Coody said. Lowering the dams will cause the Guadalupe River to return to its normal channel, which is 12 feet below the existing waterline in most places. Some houses are also on stilts for flood avoidance, putting the new water level 20-30 feet below their porches. Weak dams are a problem across the state — a problem that was brought to the forefront during Hurricane Harvey, when serious weaknesses were discovered in flood control systems in the Houston area. Researchers say the state and Harris County are making progress on long-overdue repairs two years after the hurricane. The Texas Legislature approved funding to bolster flood infrastructure this spring, and the county is utilizing a 2.5 billion bond passed on the first anniversary of the hurricane to support flood mitigation. The Addicks and Barker reservoirs are two of the biggest concerns still, said longtime environmental attorney Jim Blackburn, who teaches environmental law at Rice University and studied Harris County’s flood infrastructure after Harvey. As the city was drowning in 4 feet of rain, officials worried the reservoir dams might break and wipe away entire neighborhoods. “We're going to have to really rethink flooding and flood control almost from top to bottom,” Blackburn said. “If we can keep a lot of those low-lying areas natural, that would be great because those lands can flood without a lot of damage ... but, well, that's kind of contrary to our general philosophy.” The biggest change the state needs to make is to stop trying to build cities and structures to stay dry all the time, said Bob Gilbert, an engineering professor at the University of Texas at Austin who has also studied flood infrastructure. Rain is going to come regardless of what Texas does, and it's not always going to take a hurricane to cause flooding, as shown with the historic floods in the Rio Grande Valley last year. “We're going to need to build cities and build communities so that they can get wet every once in a while and it's not catastrophic,” Gilbert said. “Let's put a soccer field where there's a floodplain, not a hospital or a neighborhood. New Orleans and Houston are great examples of us ignoring the fact that things are going to get worse.” Coody said the lack of communication from the river authority leaves little reason for homeowners to trust that the dams will someday be rebuilt and the lakes refilled if there isn’t a plan in place before the draining. “Let's sit down and come up with the right funding vehicle to make [the repairs] happen,” Coody said. “Don't just drain the lakes and walk away. If we had been working on this three years ago, we wouldn’t even be in this situation.” Residents want to take control of the dams and form a taxing district to support them, something the river authority said it is open to. But they also say they want a plan in place to do that before the lakes are drained. In the meantime, lawyers representing more than 300 plaintiffs from the region filed two lawsuits aiming to stop the lakes from being drained until a plan is in place. Gilbert, the UT-Austin professor, said river authority officials could have been more proactive in notifying homeowners in the Guadalupe River Valley of the problems with the dams, but at this point they are in an impossible position. The flood conditions the state faces now are nothing like they were when the dams were built, and the risks of keeping the dams in place are likely too great to wait any longer. “If they ever got too much water coming into them and the water went over the top of the dam, they're not designed for that,” Gilbert said. “That flooding consequence could be a wall of water that goes down the valley and causes huge consequences of life loss and property loss.” Disclosure: The University of Texas at Austin and Rice University have been financial supporters of The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan news organization that is funded in part by donations from members, foundations and corporate sponsors.

Owner of Midland dams agrees to give them up to lakefront ownersNews Sports Autos Entertainment USA TODAY Obituaries E-Edition Legals MICHIGANLakefront owners group takes failed Midland dams from controversial owner in settlement Keith MathenyDetroit Free PressView Comments The controversial owner of four dams in Midland and Gladwin counties — including two that failed in May, causing catastrophic flooding — has agreed to give up ownership of the dams to a two-county group of lakefront owners.The Four Lakes Task Force, a property owners' group established by the Midland and Gladwin county boards of commissioners to oversee the dams and the impoundment lakes they created, on Wednesday announced a settlement of condemnation proceedings with dam owner Boyce Hydro LLC.Under terms of the agreement, which must be approved by circuit courts in both counties, the task force will pay 1.576 million to take over ownership of the dams. Some 270,000 of that money will go to Boyce Hydro; 152,000 will go to local suppliers with liens on Boyce properties, and the remaining 1.154 million will be distributed as the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Michigan in Bay City ultimately sees fit. Boyce filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the court in August."The settlement is not about the value of the property, or fairness, but it is the best deal we could get to allow the community to extract itself from the legacy of Boyce's ownership and move forward," the Four Lakes Task Force said in a statement. The Edenville Dam, a 6,600-foot earthen embankment up to 54.5 feet in height, spanning both the Tittabawassee and Tobacco rivers in Midland and Gladwin counties, failed May 19 amid days of record rainfall. The subsequent draining of Wixom Lake, the impoundment created by the dam, overwhelmed the Sanford Dam downriver, which also failed, mostly draining the Sanford Lake impoundment as well. Downriver areas were declared a federal disaster area, with more than 175 million in flood damage.Boyce Hydro had its hydro power-generating permit revoked by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in September 2018, the agency citing the dam owner's repeated failure to address safety concerns at the dam — especially its ability to withstand heavy rains.Boyce attorney Lawrence Kogan did not respond to a message seeking comment Wednesday.The Four Lakes Task Force was created by Gladwin and Midland counties in 2018 to administer and oversee the maintenance and operations of the four Boyce dams and the four lakes they create — Smallwood, Secord, Sanford and Wixom lakes. In January, the task force signed a 9.4-million purchase agreement to acquire the dams and lakes from Boyce Trusts. According to the task force's website, the title for the dams was to be held in escrow and transferred no later than 2024, with Boyce or the task force to "perform the necessary repairs or upgrades on all dams by the end of 2023."May's flooding scuttled that deal.More: Whitmer to revoke Line 5 oil pipeline easement in Straits of MackinacMore:6 months after waters recede, historic flood far from over for mid-Michigan residentsMore:Experts: Triple staffing, increase funding for Michigan dam safety unitThe task force is funded by a 350 special assessment on property owners along the lakes, with an 88 fee for nearby property owners off the lake, that will start beginning on winter 2021 tax bills. The task force wants to take over hydroelectric power generation at the dams, which would defray the costs passed on to property owners.To repair and modernize the dams and restore the drained lakes, the task force is estimating lakefront residents will face annual assessment fees of nearly 1,500 to almost 2,400 — every year for 40 years.The Four Lakes Task Force's takeover of the dam properties is expected to help facilitate the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy's efforts to assess and stabilize the remaining portions of the dams, to prevent further failures and flooding. EGLE officials have expressed criticism of Boyce Hydro's level of cooperation since the dam failures, and EGLE in August took its own emergency action to evaluate the remaining portions of the Edenville Dam.Wixom Lake's draining in the May flood on the Tittabawassee River side of the Edenville Dam led to diversion of the nearby Tobacco River, leading to the collapse of the M-30 causeway bridge and causing to run dry about a mile of the Tobacco downstream of the dam. Because the Tobacco River side of the Edenville Dam is still holding back a significant amount of water, EGLE officials want to shore up the dam over the winter, before spring runoff creates another flood disaster.EGLE hired engineering firm AECOM to design temporary measures to reduce the risk of failure, stabilize the dam and mitigate ongoing impacts such as erosion."The project that will be carried out will result in increased safety for the downstream residents, and a restoration of a portion of the downstream resources that were damaged by the initial dam failure," Teresa Seidel, director of EGLE's Water Resources Division, said in an online meeting with area residents earlier this month.A bankruptcy court hearing on the proposed settlement is slated for Nov. 30. The task force has immediate access to the dams for repairs through EGLE, and expects to take control of the properties in December."Four Lakes has an operations team in place that has been working for several weeks to plan the transition," the task force said in its statement Wednesday.Contact Keith Matheny: 313-222-5021 or kmatheny@freepress.com.View Comments Staff Directory Careers Accessibility Support Site Map Legals Our Ethical Principles Terms of Service Privacy Policy Your California Privacy Rights / Privacy PolicyDo Not Sell My Info / Cookie PolicyContact Us Support Local Businesses Advertise Your Business Advertising Terms and Conditions Buy and Sell Licensing & Reprints Help Center Subscriber Guide My Account Give FeedbackSubscribe Today Newsletters Mobile Apps Facebook Twitter E-Edition Storytellers Archives RSS FeedsJobs Cars Classifieds Education Renvy.com Michigan.com Reviewed 10Best Reach Local USA TODAY Sports+© 2022 www.freep.com.

The federation of municipalities manages the dam, and is currently analyzing data and interviewing staff to determine what happened. So far, all we know is that the dam’s flow gate lowered around 2 pm during some scheduled maintenance, and was manually raised to stop the intense flow of water. Video from the Cleveland Dam malfunction today in North Vancouver @GlobalBC @CTVVancouver @CBCVancouver I was walking my dogs there just before 2pm pic.twitter.com/Edsf6wqmWB — Christine Tam (@christinetam) October 2, 2020 Although it’s still too early to know an exact timeline of events, commissioner Jerry Dobrovolny said his 33 years of experience have taught him that massive infrastructure failures such as this are usually a combination of several factors, including both human and system errors. See also: Crews still searching for victims after Cleveland Dam malfunction One person dead after Cleveland Dam opens on Capilano River The dam’s gate has been raised to its maximum height and locked, Dobrovonly said. He reassured residents during a Friday news conference that the dam is structurally sound. The gate will be left locked through the winter, and probably won’t be lowered again until spring or summer, when the findings of Metro Vancouver’s investigation are known. The dam has no public-facing alarm or siren to alert the public when the gate is opening, Dobrovolny said. He added such a system would need to be fairly comprehensive to alert people all the way down the Capilano River about water level fluctuations. He did not say when results of the investigation would be released, although he did commit to releasing findings as they’re ready instead of waiting to release one large report. Rescue crews are still searching the river for possible victims. Besides the person who was killed, four other people were also swept up in the torrent of water, but they were able to make it back to shore. ﻿ Megan Devlin+ FOLLOWFollow Channels and Categories+ NewsADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTJOIN OUR NEWSLETTERReceive direct access to our top content, contests and perks.Email AddressFull NameFooterAdvertise with usAbout UsContactPolicies & GuidelinesAccessibilityMastheadSend us tipsContest RulesCareersAdvertise with usAbout UsContactPolicies & GuidelinesAccessibilityMastheadSend us tipsContest RulesCareersDH NewsCoronavirusWeatherTravel DealsCanadaPoliticsOpinionsVideosAnimalsMovies & TVDishedNewsOpeningsRestaurantsBrunchEventsCheap EatsSpecialsBoozeCoffee & TeaDessertsClosingsVeggieFood TrucksPatiosListedEventsConcertsSummerPhotosUrbanizedReal EstateDevelopmentTransportationArchitecturePublic ArtOpinionsVentureTechEntrepreneursJobsOpinionsVideosOffsideHockeyBasketballBaseballFootballSoccerOpinionsVideosCuratedOutdoorsHealth & FitnessBeauty & FashionHome DecorPop CultureContestsInside DHMappedNewsGuidesBucket ListTipsVideosDH NewsDishedListedUrbanizedVentureOffsideCuratedMappedDaily Hive is a Canadian-born online news source, established in 2008, that creates compelling, hyperlocal content.

The ongoing construction is to prepare for raising the tailings pond dam's walls by 14 feet. A possible dam breach has Royer, who lives downstream, concerned. RYAN BERRY PHOTOS, Billings Gazette Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Copy article link Save Brett French Construction of a bigger dam to contain waste rock from the East Boulder Mine in south-central Montana has neighboring landowner Leon Royer concerned.Should the dam fail, Royer said, the owners of the mine — South African company Sibanye-Stillwater — have done little to protect or help downstream landowners. Royer seeks evacuation plans for a breach, a back-up dam and bonded compensation if lands are buried under waste from the platinum and palladium mine.Heather McDowell, vice president of legal, environmental and government affairs for Sibanye-Stillwater, wrote in an email that Royer’s concerns are unfounded.“We are very proud of our tailings design and management and the community involvement that has gone into that over the years,” she said. McDowell said the dam will be engineered and monitored to the strictest standards required under U.S. law and permitting, such that it would only fail if there was 47 inches of precipitation in 24 hours or a 7.5 earthquake — both of which are unlikely. (The 1959 Hebgen Lake earthquake was 7.2.)

He points to other examples of human engineering hubris, such as the unsinkable Titanic and the tilting Millennium Tower in San Francisco, as reasons to be skeptical of engineers’ assurances. The dam failures Royer referred to in British Columbia and Brazil featured different designs than the one being built along the East Boulder River, McDowell noted. The downstream design being used by Sibanye-Stillwater “is the most robust, and was originally developed for areas with high seismic activity and high rainfall or water collection,” she added, and once built, the dams are continuously monitored. Evaporators run at the tailings pond at the East Boulder Mine, a way to remove liquid from the mine waste. The evaporators sit atop the current dam. RYAN BERRY, Billings Gazette Going upRoyer’s concerns are in part related to the mine raising the height of the East Boulder tailings dam walls by 14 feet. The project was approved by the Custer Gallatin National Forest last year. As part of the permitting process, public comment was taken into consideration. Locally, the Cottonwood Resource Council was involved in the project as part of the mine’s Good Neighbor Agreement. Created in 2000, the agreement established a process for citizens to raise concerns about the mine’s work in an attempt to protect the land and waters surrounding the East Boulder and associated Stillwater mines under the umbrella of the Northern Plains Resource Council. “We’ve advocated that all of the construction follow best management practices, and we’re confident it will,” said Jerry Iverson, a council member since 1988.Iverson was present when Royer outlined his concerns to the Sweet Grass County Commission on Sept. 1, a meeting that drew an overflow crowd. “He has valid concerns,” Iverson said, adding that any time there is construction like the new tailings storage facility, downstream residents should be interested.The Cottonwood Resource Council has done its best to hire outside experts who have assured the group the dam will be built to the best standards, Iverson noted. If those criteria aren’t reassuring enough, he said concerned citizens need to approach their legislators to pass more restrictive state mining laws. “Because it’s largely a political issue,” he said. The new tailings dam will be built from a combination of mine waste and rock taken from this pit. Portions of the mine are on Custer Gallatin National Forest land. RYAN BERRY, Billings Gazette TailingsThe higher dam walls now under construction will allow the East Boulder Mine to continue operating until about 2029, accepting an additional 1.8 million cubic yards of waste rock. Without the expansion, the current facility has the capacity for only 9 million cubic yards of tailings, which is expected to be filled by 2025. (One cubic yard of soil can cover 100 square feet at a depth of 2 inches. It’s also equal to about 202 gallons.)Once the expanded tailings facility is full, it will be capped with sediment and revegetated. To continue operating beyond 2029, the mine is seeking to create a separate tailings facility in Lewis Gulch. That plan is currently working its way through the state and federal permitting process, which will include an environmental analysis and opportunity for public comment. The Lewis Gulch facility is proposed to hold about 5.8 million cubic yards of tailings so the mine can continue to operate through 2042. The Montana Department of Environmental Quality has received information on the Lewis Gulch proposal but has questions mine officials need to answer before it can move forward with the permitting process, according to the DEQ’s Moira Davin. “We’re still in the early stages,” she said. The blue-green shine of mine tailings can be seen from a vantage point at the East Boulder Mine. The owners of the mine, Sibanye-Stillwater, plan to increase the size of the tailings facility. RYAN BERRY, BILLINGS GAZETTE FailuresFour engineers wrote in a peer reviewed analysis of the Brazil tailings dam failure, “It is often not possible to reduce the risk posed by a tailings dam to zero.”The 2021 article, published by the European Geosciences Union, goes on to note, “The probability of a tailings dam failing is relatively high compared to other pieces of infrastructure that pose similar risks to people and for which the consequences of a failure are also high. In addition, even if there are no people directly at risk, the pollutants released into the environment can have health implications for those living further downstream, as well as impact the environment and people's livelihoods.”According to a breach analysis completed as part of the East Boulder Mine’s previous environmental impact statement, in the unlikely event that the main tailings dam should fail, in a worst-case scenario engineers expect that between 20 and 30 buildings would be flooded, from 10 to 100 people could be killed, all bridges crossing the river would be “overtopped” as the river climbed 6 to 8 feet above its average maximum spring flow. Royer said he first learned about the consequences of a dam breach at a meeting organized by the mine to provide the public with information concerning emergency preparedness. He was astonished to discover there was little planning on the county’s part if such a disaster should occur.He also questioned mine representatives about their level of insurance to make landowners whole if a breach occurred and was told different amounts.No matter the amount of coverage, he said a more certain way to remove his concerns would be for the mine to post a larger bond amount. The current 30 million bond only covers rehabilitation after mining is complete. He is also advocating for a downstream failsafe dam to prevent a wave of waste rock from ever reaching landowners.Iverson called the mine’s attempts to inform the public “awkward and clumsy,” but doesn’t think they are trying to hide anything. Given the laws overseeing mining, he said Sibanye-Stillwater will come up with a plan for catastrophic failure if pressed. Certainly that’s something the public can request as the company goes through its next round of permitting for the Lewis Gulch facility, he noted. Royer walks around his property where he's lived since retiring from a career in banking. RYAN BERRY, Billings Gazette TransplantRoyer moved to his remote property along the East Boulder River, located about 25 miles south of Big Timber, after retiring as president of American Bank of Montana, based in Bozeman.The land he and his wife developed runs along close to a quarter mile of the East Boulder River, about 5 miles downstream from the tailings dam, and shares a boundary with the Custer Gallatin National Forest. Should the dam ever fail, he’s been told he and his wife will have about eight minutes to reach higher ground.Natural disasters such as forest fires and floods were something he and his wife considered before building along the East Boulder, but not the possibility of their home being destroyed by a tailings dam breach.“I started pursuing this because I felt like I wanted to get the full story,” he said.Follow-up meetings with mine executives have failed to soothe his concerns, and he’s worried that if a disaster ever did occur, the mine owners would walk away leaving the locals and state to clean up the mess.“This is just a contemporary version, in my opinion, of what used to happen in Montana as far as mines come in, take all the wealth … and good luck,” Royer said.Since insurance can lapse, he called on the county commission to require the mine to post a bond to make landowners whole if there was a dam breach. County Commissioner Bill Wallace told the Big Timber Pioneer newspaper the commission has “no regulatory power over the mine in this instance,” but went on to add that the county is considering hiring an independent engineer to look into Royer’s concerns. The East Boulder River runs past the yard of Leon Royer’s home. The stream joins the Boulder River, a tributary to the Yellowstone River. RYAN BERRY, Billings Gazette WaterRoyer’s downstream acquaintance, landowner George Matelich, said the possibility of a dam failure was not on his radar prior to Royer speaking up and drawing attention to the issue.“My concern is the Boulder River and Yellowstone River,” Matelich said. “Nobody is going to shed a tear for a guy like me if I lose my ranch.”Calling the rivers a priceless resource, Matelich said it makes sense to take every precaution possible to avoid the risk of a tailings dam failure. With Montana’s past riddled by previous mining pollution problems, he said it’s up to current residents to ensure history doesn’t repeat itself.Royer stressed that he’s not anti-mining and doesn’t want to see the mine closed, but he wants the mining company to take his concerns seriously.“These guys up here making a living, I admire them,” Royer said of the miners. “It’s tough work.”The East Boulder Mine employed 455 people at the end of August, not including contractors, McDowell said. All told, Sibanye-Stillwater employs 1,950 people in Montana, the majority of whom live in surrounding Sweet Grass, Stillwater, Yellowstone, Carbon, Park and Gallatin counties, she added. The business contributes about 3 billion to the state’s economy.Royer said the East Boulder Mine can continue to operate and protect the environment at the same time.“They aren’t mutually exclusive,” he said.

Scott Williams Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Copy article link Save Scott Williams BURLINGTON — State regulators are trying to protect Burlington from a “tsunami” flood disaster if the Echo Lake dam should fail, a city official said during a community meeting on the lake’s future.“They’re worried about loss of life and property from a dam failing,” Peter Riggs, the city’s director of public works, said while addressing questions from the public about the state’s motives for insisting that the city-owned dam be upgraded or removed.Saying that dam failure on the 70-acre lake would have a “tsunami effect,” Riggs told the crowd: “You have catastrophic, uncontrolled release of floodwater. Removing that hazard needs to be our goal.” If the dam is removed, Echo Lake will drain and vanish into the history books. If city officials want to salvage the lake, they must invest about 5 million in new infrastructure and other improvements.About 50 people turned out Tuesday night inside Veterans Terrace for the first of two community meetings on the issue.

Participants in the community meeting voiced mixed feelings on the lake.Yvette Moeller, a member of a Facebook group called “Save Echo Lake and Dam,” said the lake is a popular attraction and Burlington taxpayers would gladly spend 5 million to keep it.“We know what we have,” she said. “And we know what needs to be done.”Another resident, Kim Lunderskov, said the lake has become too much of a flood hazard and should be drained.Lunderskov said the 70-acre site — which includes the White River — could be reclaimed as a natural resource. “It doesn’t have to be baseball fields or basketball fields,” he said. “Just have it be a natural habitat.” Engineers have estimated that it would cost 1.1 million to remove the dam and drain the lake, possibly reaching 1.5 million or 2 million with contingency funds and engineering work.To save the lake, engineers have calculated that the city would have to invest about 5 million — half for rebuilding and fortifying the dam, half for dredging years of pollution and sediment from the lake bottom. Whatever option the city chooses, the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources must approve and issue a permit. Either way, the lake will have to be drained, at least partially and temporarily. DNR officials notified Burlington in 2015 that the aging and deteriorating dam is a “significant hazard.” The city was ordered to address the situation within 10 years — by 2025.Back to original state, possible The manmade lake was created in the 1800s when industrial entrepreneurs built a dam on the White River to harness power for operating a mill. The current dam is believed to be at least 50 years old. An engineer's rendering depicts a restored White River flowing in Burlington, if the city decides to remove the dam at Echo Lake and allow the manmade lake to drain into the river. Submitted If the dam is removed, the lake will drain into the White River and the river will resume flowing through the 70-acre site. Engineers have described several improvements the city could make on the former lakebed, including boardwalks and fishing docks.Riggs told participants in the community meeting that possibilities for new amenities are “limited only by your imaginations.” “The sky’s the limit,” he said. Some participants questioned whether flooding could still occur at the site once the lake is drained. Riggs said flooding is always a risk in parks, but that draining the lake would remove the risk of the dam failing and unleashing a torrent of lake water on the community. Enter Robin Vos: Assembly speaker steps into heated debate about Echo Lake in Burlington In a growing debate surrounding the future of Echo Lake in Burlington, Wisconsin Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, a local Republican, said he may lobby regulators at the state Department of Natural Resources to save the troubled lake. Tom Vos, a former Burlington aldermen who also is the father of Wisconsin Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, said he favors investing in modernizing the dam and keeping Echo Lake.Vos said he believes most people in the city would be willing to pay higher taxes to fund the project.“Are we going to have to pay for it?” he said. “You bet.”Robin Vos said in an interview last week that he wants to preserve the troubled lake, if necessary by lobbying regulators at the state Department of Natural Resources.

Dangerous dams in Upstate?News Sports Life Downtown Business TALK Obituaries E-Edition Legals Dangerous dams in Upstate?Rick BrundrettStaff writerView CommentsView CommentsDam after dam in South Carolina's capital city area failed amid historic rainfall and flooding over the past week, inflicting misery on thousands of residents. However, the man-made barriers holding back water in the Upstate appeared to have held steady.At least for now.The 20 dams that state officials say had failed as of Saturday – 13 in Richland County, parts of which received more than 20 inches of rain; three in Lexington County; two in Aiken County; and one each in Orangeburg and Lee counties – were earthen dams built from 1900 through 1963, according to the National Inventory of Dams (NID), maintained by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.An analysis by The Greenville News of the inventory, which was last updated in 2013, found similar characteristics among 604 listed dams in Greenville, Spartanburg, Pickens, Oconee, Anderson and Laurens counties. The total number of dams in the six-county region represents about 25 percent of the 2,439 listed dams statewide, the vast majority of which are state-regulated.Consider:Of the 604 dams, nearly 95 percent are earthen, which is about the same percentage statewide.The dams in the six-county region were built from 1812 through 2003, with the median (halfway point on the list) age ranging from 1962 to 1971. Several of oldest-listed dams statewide date to 1800.Nearly 80 percent of the dams in the six-county are privately owned, and two-thirds were constructed primarily for recreational purposes. Statewide, those percentages are 85 percent and 77 percent, respectively.Of the total number of dams in the six-county region, 417, or 69 percent, didn't have a listed Emergency Action Plan (EAP), defined as a plan of action to be taken by a dam owner to reduce the potential of loss of life and property damage in an area affected by a dam failure or flooding. Statewide, that percentage was about 71 percent.No most-recent inspection dates were listed for 363, or 60 percent, of the dams in the six-county region, compared to 65 percent for the state. Last-known inspection dates statewide ranged from 1987 to 2012; the median date was in November 2010."I wouldn't want to be living downstream from a hazardous dam," state Sen. Larry Martin, R-Pickens, said when contacted by The Greenville News. "I'm certain that a lot of people who woke up in the middle of the night – Sunday morning – when water was rising in Columbia, they had no clue that they were in that type of harm's way."Although the national inventory database lists about 2,400 dams in South Carolina, "there could be 10 times that number of additional, smaller dams in S.C.," Gerrit Jobsis, senior director of rivers in southern Appalachia and the Carolinas for the Washington, D.C.-based environmental organization American Rivers, told The News."We've done a damned good job of damming our rivers," he said, explaining that some dams harm the environment and increase the potential for flooding.Safety Rankings SecretDams that are at least 25 feet tall and 15 acre-feet in storage, or at least 6 feet tall and 50 acre-feet in storage are included in the NID, according to the Army Corps of Engineers website.The database also includes potentially "high hazard" and "significant hazard" dams, according to the site, though it doesn't specify which ones meet those criteria. Army Corps of Engineers spokesman Pete Pierce in a written response Thursday said that information is "not publicly available from the National Inventory of Dams," referring The News to state dam-safety officials.But the S.C. Department of Health and Environmental Control, which manages the state's dam-safety program, couldn't immediately produce a statewide classification list when contacted by The Greenville News. State dam-safety programs regulate 77 percent of the 87,000 dams nationwide listed in the NID, according to the Kentucky-based, Association of State Dam Safety Officials."Our people are still in the field, and it would be inadvisable to pull them off life-safety missions to pull files," DHEC spokesman Jim Beasley said on Thursday in an email response.The safety hazard classification, which refers to the consequences of a dam's failure, though not to the dam's current condition, is important to know when assessing, for example, whether an Emergency Action Plan is needed, said Mark Ogden, the association's project manager.Besides requesting the statewide classification list, The News also asked DHEC for inspection records of the failed Columbia-area dams but was informed those documents also were not readily available.Under DHEC regulations, a "high hazard," or "Class I," ranking means a dam failure will "likely cause loss of life or serious damage" to homes, industrial and commercial buildings; "important public utilities;" main highways; or railroads.Under a "substantial hazard, or "Class II," classification, a dam failure will "not likely cause loss of life but may damage" property or "cause interruption of use or service of relatively important public utilities."The least-serious classification level – "low hazard" or "Class III" – means, according to the regulations, loss of life is "not expected," and dam failure "may cause minimal property damage to others."Of the 20 failed dams (not including the Columbia Canal breach) that DHEC listed on its website as of Saturday, seven – six of which are located in Richland County – are ranked as Class I; 10, Class II; two, Class III; and one is a federal dam at Fort Jackson.As of 2012, there were 162 potentially high-hazard and 463 potentially significant-hazard dams in South Carolina, according to association's website. A total of 93 potentially high- and significant-hazard dams are located in South Carolina's 4th Congressional District, which includes Greenville and Spartanburg counties, according to information provided by Ogden, though he declined to identify specific dams, referring The News to S.C. officials.Ogden, a registered professional engineer and retired Ohio Department of Natural Resources administrator, said most U.S. dams are earthen structures, noting although they "should be able to withstand a certain amount of flooding," they are "more susceptible to washing out.""If it's over the top (of the dam), it's going to erode; and if it does it that long enough, it's going to fail," he said.No Answers NowAt a press briefing Wednesday, Gov. Nikki Haley deflected reporters' questions about the lack of public information on dam safety in the Palmetto State, saying she needed to stay focused on dealing with the aftermath of the massive rainfall and flooding. As of Friday, officials had attributed 17 deaths to the record weather event, which Haley has described as a "thousand-year flood.""What I'm trying to do is get South Carolina through this event," Haley told reporters. "And so you can ask all these questions after this event, but right now my focus is on the 62 (potentially failing dams) we're watching, on the people being safe; and that's our focus."DHEC Director Catherine Heigel said at the press conference, in response to reporters' questions, that "modernization of our infrastructure – our IT infrastructure in particular – is something that is a No. 1 priority for me, and that will better enable us to give data to you when you ask for it."Sen. Martin told The News he is "confident" DHEC will publicly release more records on dam safety once the immediate crisis subsides.DHEC said it couldn't immediately provide updated staffing and budget information on its dam-safety program. As of 2012, the program had the equivalent of 2.57 full-time employees in its program and a total budget that year of 105,081, according to the safety officials association website. In 2013, South Carolina had a safety budget of 1,000 per regulated, potentially high-hazard dams, compared to a nearly 4,000 national average.Asked if the S.C. Legislature should budget more money for the state's dam-safety program, Martin replied, "I would assume that is something that is going be looked at again in reviewing this entire episode." But he added he doesn't know how much money would be needed if lawmakers push for it, or where additional revenue would be found.South Carolina last year also fell well below national averages for model inspection and Emergency Action Plan and response programs, according to the association's site."From a regulatory point of view, it's just grossly understaffed," said Dave Hargett, co-founder and executive director of The Conestee Foundation, which bought the Lake Conestee Brownfield site and dam south of downtown Greenville in 2000 to develop what is now the approximately 400-acre Lake Conestee Nature Park.The Greenville News in 2013 reported that the Reedy River dam, built in 1892, was repaired to hold back more than 2 million cubic yards of contaminated sediment that washed downstream over the years from Greenville's industrial mills. Hargett said dams should be inspected regularly, particularly given that the average design life of many dams is about 50 years."Dams don't last forever," he said.Reach Brundrett at rbrundrett@greenvillenews.comView CommentsView CommentsStaff Directory Careers Accessibility Support Site Map Legals Our Ethical Principles Terms of Service Privacy Policy Your California Privacy Rights / Privacy PolicyDo Not Sell My Info / Cookie PolicyContact Us Support Local Business Advertise Your Business Advertising Terms and Conditions Buy and Sell Help Center Subscriber Guide My Account Give Feedback Licensing & ReprintsSubscribe Today Newsletters Mobile Apps Facebook Twitter E-Edition Storytellers Archives RSS FeedsJobs Cars Homes Classifieds Education Moonlighting Reviewed 10Best Reach Local USA TODAY Sports+© 2022 www.greenvilleonline.com.

Home to about 15 million people, weeks of intermittent flooding have intensified in Bahia state in the last two days after a pair of dams collapsed, sending residents scrambling. “Unfortunately, we’re living through the worst disaster that has ever occurred in the history of Bahia,” the state’s governor, Rui Costa, said on Monday on Twitter, adding that 72 municipalities in Bahia are in a state of emergency. Teams of rescuers are trying to transport supplies and bring medical care to victims, the governor also said, but damage to bridges and highways has made those efforts more difficult. The two dams that collapsed over the weekend were in the cities of Jussiape and Itambe. Rescue workers have been patrolling in small dinghies around the city of Itabuna, plucking residents from their homes, including some who escaped through second-floor windows. Manfredo Santana, a spokesperson for Bahia’s firefighting corps, told the Reuters news agency on Monday that emergency workers had rescued 200 people in three towns. The heavy currents of the swollen Cachoeira River complicated rescue efforts. “It’s difficult to manoeuver even with jet skis,” he said. “Rescue teams had to retreat in certain moments.” Bahia’s civil defence agency said on Monday afternoon that 20 people had died as a result of the floods in 11 separate municipalities. The state government said a day earlier that more than 16,000 people had been left homeless by the flooding. In televised remarks, Costa attributed the chaotic scenes in part to “errors that have been committed over the course of years”. Newspaper O Globo, citing a state firefighting official, reported that authorities are monitoring an additional 10 dams for any signs they may collapse. Scrutiny of public infrastructure and urban planning comes just a few years after the collapse of a mining dam in neighbouring Minas Gerais state killed some 270 people. A government task force made up of military firefighters and police has been set up in badly-hit areas of Bahia to help respond to the disaster. In the state capital of Salvador, weather officials said December rainfall has been six times greater than the average. The heavy rainfall coincides with La Nina, a weather phenomenon that typically occurs every three to five years and leads to cooler Pacific Ocean temperatures than normal.

Share Resources & Agriculture Third engineer disciplined in Mount Polley tailings dam failure Maximum fine imposed on the senior geotechnical engineer at the B.C. mine By Arthur Williams, Prince George Citizen | March 11, 2022, 3:45pm The failure of a tailings pond dam on Aug. 4, 2014 sent tons of water and slurry into Hazeltine Creek, Polley Lake and Quesnel Lake | File photo The regulatory body for engineers in B.C. has disciplined a third engineer for unprofessional conduct connected to the failure of a tailings pond dam failure at the Mount Polley Mine on Aug. 4, 2014. In a consent order, former engineer Todd Martin agreed to pay a fine of 25,000 and 69,000 in legal costs for his role in the dam failure, a statement issued by Engineers and Geoscientists British Columbia on Friday. “From March 2011 to December 2012, Mr. Martin was the senior geotechnical engineer responsible for the geotechnical engineering work at the Mount Polley Mine TSF,” the statement said. “In the Consent Order, Mr. Martin admitted to some of the allegations that aspects of his engineering work were not consistent with prudent engineering practice, including his failure to recommend drilling from the 2011 embankment crest into soils under the footprint of the TSF perimeter embankment to improve the characterization of embankment foundation soils. Mr. Martin further admitted that he failed to make a record of important field observations in 2011, a matter which constitutes unprofessional conduct.” Martin ceased to be a practising engineer in 2018 and resigned his engineering licence in January 2020, the statement added. If Martin does apply to register as an engineer again, there are additional steps he will be required to follow outlined in the consent order. Under the Engineers and Geoscientists Act at the time of the dam failure, 25,000 was the maximum possible fine. The act has since been repealed and replaced by the Professional Governance Act, which allows for fines of up to 100,000 for individuals and 250,000 for companies. Engineers and Geoscientists BC announced disciplinary action against Martin's colleagues, former engineer Stephen Rice and engineer Laura Fidel, in August 2021. The investigation into the cases took years, and involved reviewing thousands of documents, the statement said. On Aug. 4, 2014, the tailings pond at the Mount Polley copper mine collapsed, sending 20 million cubic metres of water and tailings slurry into Hazeltine Creek, Polley Lake and Quesnel Lake, near the town of Likely, B.C.. The disaster was one of the largest dam failures in the past 50 years, and cost Imperial Metals 67 million in clean-up costs and lost revenue. The disciplinary panels did not make findings as to the cause of the embankment failure, which was separately addressed in reports by the Chief Inspector of Mines and Mount Polley Independent Expert Engineering Investigation. “This marks the final chapter in a long and difficult story for our province and our professions,” Engineers and Geoscientists BC CEO Heidi Yang said in the statement. “Over the past several years, our focus has been on delivering a comprehensive, rigorous, and fair process, and we’re pleased to be able to provide the public with these results. The conclusion of these cases, combined with resources we’ve developed to improve dam safety, will strengthen our professions and our province’s environmental safeguards.” View comments Top Stories 1 New fuel cell manufacturing plant opens in Burnaby By Nelson Bennett 1 Canada is extending its COVID-19 border measures until Sept. 30 By Elana Shepert, Vancouver Is Awesome 1 Employment scams targeting young adults, warns bureau By Valerie Leung, Richmond News 1 Canadian researchers reveal hope-filled discovery for long COVID patients By Pippa Norman 1 B.C. stock promoter used Colombia 'boiler room' in offshore scheme, SEC alleges By Graeme Wood Related News Technology New fuel cell manufacturing plant opens in Burnaby By Nelson Bennett Economy, Law & Politics Canada is extending its COVID-19 border measures until Sept. 30 By Elana Shepert, Vancouver Is Awesome Human Resources & Education Employment scams targeting young adults, warns bureau By Valerie Leung, Richmond News Economy, Law & Politics Canadian researchers reveal hope-filled discovery for long COVID patients By Pippa Norman Economy, Law & Politics B.C. stock promoter used Colombia 'boiler room' in offshore scheme, SEC alleges By Graeme Wood Real Estate Land sales dominate commercial deals in Lower Mainland By Western Investor staff Real Estate B.C. sees record-low mortgages in arrears By Peter Mitham, Western Investor Economy, Law & Politics 6 in 10 Canadians relocated as a result of the pandemic, survey shows By Graeme Wood View more news Main navigation NewsVideoAudioEventsLists温村商讯User menuLogin Sections Asia PacificCommentaryEconomy, Law & PoliticsEntertainment, Media & SportsEnvironmentHospitality, Marketing & TourismHuman Resources & EducationReal EstateResources & AgricultureRetail & ManufacturingTechnologyThe BIV InterviewTransportationPolitical Ads RegistryBIV Magazine Tertiary Menu Living/WorkingSubscribeAdvertiseDigital EditionsMagazinesContact BIVNewsletters Footer tertiary menu SubscribeNewslettersAdvertise Facebook-Dark Created with Sketch.

REUTERS/Ricardo Moraes/File PhotoContacted in Brazil, Vale declined comment.'GOOD DAY FOR JUSTICE'The case was revived after PGMBM in April applied for an oral Court of Appeal hearing - reserved only for exceptional cases - and argued the appeal judge had not properly grappled with arguments about why the case should proceed. read more Martyn Day, the Leigh Day lawyer who has taken on miner Vedanta and oil giant Shell (RDSa.L) in English courts on behalf of villagers over alleged pollution in Zambia and oil spills in the Niger delta respectively, welcomed the ruling."It is highly unusual for the Court of Appeal to use this mechanism (of an oral hearing) for reviewing a decision of a fellow member of the court," he said. "A good day for justice."Claimant lawyers have argued that most of their clients have not brought proceedings in Brazil, that they are entitled to sue BHP in England and that Brazilian litigation is so lengthy that it cannot provide full redress in a realistic timeframe.The lawsuit is the latest battle to establish whether multinationals can be held liable for the conduct of overseas subsidiaries on their home turf.The appeal is expected to be heard next year and any ruling is likely to be further appealed to the Supreme Court in London.Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.comRegisterReporting by Kirstin Ridley; Editing by Kirsten Donovan and Edmund BlairOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.EnergyGazprom will send more gas to Kaliningrad Baltic exclave, says governor, article with imageEnergy · June 29, 2022Russia's state natural gas producer Gazprom will increase gas supplies to the Baltic exclave of Kaliningrad, regional governor Anton Alikhanov said on Wednesday, amid increased tensions with neighbouring Lithuania.EnergyGermany's power industry body urges more land for wind farms, article with image12:24 AM UTCMarketsAustralia's AGL Energy says rebuffed suitor Brookfield has bought small stake, article with image2:22 AM UTCMarketsVietnam plans to cut MFN tariff on gasoline to fight inflation, article with image5:35 AM UTCClimate ChangeState agency wants net zero carbon emissions from Australia's biggest LNG plant this decade, article with image6:17 AM UTC .

Copy Link Download the app The Mosul Dam http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Mosul_Dam_hydro_power_plant.jpg Iraq's largest dam is at the epicenter of fierce fighting between ISIS and the Kurdish Peshmerga. But whoever ends up holding the dam will face a serious challenge just ensuring that the neglected dam does not fail.Kurdish forces currently hold the Mosul Dam, according to the dam's director. However, even if the Kurds maintain their control over the dam, the dam's structural flaws and poor state of maintenance present a serious risk to all of down-river Iraq. The Army Corps of Engineers found in 2007 that the dam had an exceptionally high probability of failure. If the dam were to collapse, it could kill an estimated half-million people from flooding, power outages, loss of farmland, and eventual drought. According to the New Yorker, the capital of Baghdad could see about 15 feet of water.The dam was originally constructed atop a bed of highly soluble gypsum which began to dissolve even before the construction of the dam was finished. The dissolution of the gypsum was actually noticed during construction in the 1980s — during the rule of dictator Saddam Hussein, whom the dam was named after for a time — and preventative measures were put in place.But these measures failed and the dam now needs to be grouted continuously just to prevent the bedrock from dissolving beneath the dam. The grouting process involves injecting materials into the base of a dam to prevent water seepage, requiring considerable skill and technical expertise."It's been under continuous grouting since the 1980s," Richard Coffman, an assistant professor of civil engineering at the University of Arkansas who has conducted research on the Mosul Dam, told Business Insider. "The dam is grouted six times a week to prevent it from failing." Without this grouting, the dam's base will eventually dissolve."It would be a pretty rapid dissolution of the dam given the constant grouting. I can't give an exact time, but the frequency of the grouting makes me believe that the dissolution would occur quickly," Coffman said.According to Coffman, Mosul could be flooded with up to 30 meters of water within three and a half hours of the dam's failure.Baghdad would be subsumed in five meters of water within three days. "Around 50% of the city of Mosul would be inundated with water," Coffman told BI. "The cropland and farmland would also be flooded and washed away." Google Maps Should ISIS take control of the dam, unleashing its water could be part of the jihadist group's overall strategy in the country. In January 2014, ISIS took control of the Fallujah Dam for four months. While in control, ISIS triggered flooding that reached almost to Baghdad and caused a water shortage for hundreds of thousands of Iraqis. And thanks to the dam's poor construction and grouting issues, ISIS could also inadvertently cause flooding without even meaning to."Grouting is typically a learned skill done by experts," Coffman said. "I can't speak to the skill of the insurgents, but I'd imagine that they might have some trouble with this." Permanent solutions to the dam's various engineering issues have been attempted, but have so far been ineffective, according to Coffman.

The Lewisville dam is currently functioning as designed according to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.(Ron Baselice / Staff Photographer)By Jeff Mosier10:42 AM on Oct 18, 2018 CDTEditor's note: This story was first published on April 19, 2018. We are republishing it in light of rising water level in the dam after record rainfalls.Since a spring 2015 scare at the Lewisville Lake dam, repairs have been on a fast track. But that means years when it comes to federal funding.Now, preparations are accelerating for the 150 million Army Corps of Engineers project to secure one of the region's most critical pieces of infrastructure, which the corps once rated as the eighth-riskiest in the nation.The first contract is expected to be awarded next year with construction also starting in 2019.Even without the first large chunk of funding — about 55 million already in President Donald Trump's budget — workers are already drilling deep under the concrete spillway to better understand what's needed to ensure the dam's integrity."Dams are designed and built to reduce flood risks, but they cannot eliminate all risks," said Col. Calvin C. Hudson II, commander of the corps' Fort Worth district. But he emphasized that the dam is safe and effective. Hudson also used the often-repeated phrase that the dam is "functioning as designed."Concerns about the Lewisville Lake dam came to the public's attention following a late 2015  Dallas Morning News story called "The Dam Called Trouble." That recounted the discovery of a sand boil — or whirlpool — that officials briefly worried could have led to dam failure.Quick action stopped the sand boil, and staff has continued monitoring that area closely. A decade ago, corps engineers found seepage under the dam's foundation and some embankment instability.The 63-year-old earthen dam is considered high-risk in part because of the consequences of failure. Federal estimates are that complete failure would threaten 431,000 people and could potentially flood downtown Dallas with 50 feet of water.The upcoming repairs include new anchors for the concrete spillway and additional concrete covering it. A new berm, collection and filtering system will keep tabs on and manage seepage underneath the dam. The repair plans are reviewed by experts inside and outside of the corps.The contract planned for next year will address seepage, which caused the sand boil that concerned corps officials in 2015."We want to make sure that the seepage doesn't get out of control," Sarwenaj Ashraf, dam safety program manager for the corps' Fort Worth district. She said that some seepage is expected though.The next contract, expected in 2021, would be for spillway improvements. Drilling equipment is already boring six holes as deep as 130 feet to test the soil. That work will help the corps decide how many new anchors are needed and how strong they must be to reinforce the spillway.Lewisville Lake dam improvements are expected to be completed by 2026 to 2028, a couple of years later than expected. Corps officials said the need to break the 150 million project into small pieces is expected to delay completion.Project funding will also include money to strengthen parts of the dam against slides.1/8A view of the 6.2-mile long Lewisville Dam with wetlands and the University of North Texas Education Center in the foreground at Lewisville Lake in Lewisville, Texas.

The corps had described that as mostly cosmetic and not a threat to the dam's structural integrity. Those repairs cost about 8.8 million.While these are large projects, Hudson said there are annual and every five-year assessments of the dam. Those and daily checks also lead to small repairs and routine maintenance that Hudson likened to keeping a car running."If we see something," he said, "we fix something."Jeff Mosierjmosier@dallasnews.com @jeffmosier FeaturedToday's ePaperBest in DFW NominationsYour City's News PodcastsTimeless in TexasCurious TexasPublic NoticesNewspaper ArchivesPuzzles and gamesAl Día - Noticias en Español Obituaries4 face charges as death toll rises to 53 in San Antonio trailerMost Americans disapprove of Supreme Court overturning Roe v.

HomeBase MetalsSamarco enters into agreement with prosecutor over tailings dam failure Base MetalsInternationalNews Samarco enters into agreement with prosecutor over tailings dam failure By Tessa Kruger Jan 20, 2017 The Samarco dam failure on 5 November 2015 killed 17 people and polluted more than 800 km of waterways ultimately connected to the Atlantic ocean The framework agreement is for the remediation and compensation of the impact of the dam failure. The federal prosecutors are not a party to the framework agreement. The preliminary agreement outlines the process and timeline for negotiation of a settlement of the US47.5 billion civil claim relating to the dam failure. It provides for the appointment of experts to advise the federal prosecutors in relation to the social and environmental impacts of the dam failure, any revisions to the social and environmental remediation programmes under the framework agreement and for the ongoing assessment and monitoring of the programmes. Samarco, Vale and BHP Billiton Brasil will provide existing studies and research to the expert advisors. The conclusions of the expert advisors will be considered in the negotiations of a final settlement arrangement with the federal prosecutors, which is expected to occur by 30 June 2017 under the timeframe established in the preliminary agreement. Under the preliminary agreement, Samarco, Vale and BHP Billiton Brasil will provide, subject to court approval, total security of about 675 million to support the payments for the programmes. The interim security comprises a charge over Samarco’s assets of approximately 245 million, insurance bonds of about 400 million and liquid assets of about 30 million. The preliminary agreement also requires Samarco, Vale and BHP Billiton Brazil to advance 60 million of the funding obligations under the framework agreement to programmes for the municipalities of Barra Longa, Rio Doce, Santa Cruz do Escalvado and Ponte Nova. The funds are to be advanced within 90 days after signing of the preliminary agreement. During the period that the interim security is in place, it will, subject to court approval, replace the 370 million issued in the civil claim. In addition, the applications by the federal prosecutors for the approximately 2.4 billion in the civil claim and the asset freezing order (approximately 6 billion) in the criminal proceedings against Samarco, Vale, BHP Billiton Brasil and others will be suspended. The parties have agreed that the interim security will remain in place until the earlier of 30 June 2017 and the date that a final settlement arrangement is agreed. If a final settlement arrangement is not agreed by 30 June 2017, the federal prosecutors may request reinstatement of the 370 injunction. Any restart of operations at Samarco is subject to a separate set of negotiations with relevant parties and will occur only if it is safe, economically viable and has the support of the community. Resuming operations would require government approvals, the granting of licenses by state authorities, the restructure of Samarco’s debt, and the completion of commercial arrangements with Vale regarding the use of its infrastructure.

CEO and execs charged with homicide in Samarco dam collapse in Brazil English (Chinese)Deutsch (German)Español (Spanish)Français (French)Bahasa Indonesia (Indonesian)Italiano (Italian)日本語 (Japanese)Brasil (Portuguese)IndiaPhilippinesहिंदी (Hindi) RainforestsOceansAnimalsEnvironmentBusinessSolutionsFor KidsDONATEImpactMore CEO and execs charged with homicide in Samarco dam collapse in Brazil by Jenny Gonzales on 25 February 2016 On November 5, 2015, a Samarco tailings dam burst in Minas Gerais state, causing an avalanche of 2.2 billion cubic feet of mud and mine waste, killing 17 people, while two remain missing.Indictments of “qualified homicide with eventual intent” have been handed down for Samarco CEO Ricardo Vescovi and five other executives for dam safety and security violations, plus an engineer from VogBR due to his responsibility for the report assuring the dam’s safety.Investigators have found that that the Samarco company was aware of decreasing long term drainage from the dam, which resulted in a buildup of water behind it, which finally led to the collapse.

Brazil’s civil police in Minas Gerais have ordered the provisional detention of Samarco CEO Ricardo Vescovi (on leave of absence) and five other mining company executives for dam safety and security violations, plus an engineer from VogBR who was responsible for the report ensuring the stability of the Fundão tailings impoundment that burst on November 5, releasing 2.2 billion cubic feet of mud and mine waste into the Doce River killing at least 17 people. According to police chief Rodrigo Bustamante, it has been proved that the seven employees were responsible for the disaster, since they did nothing to prevent it, although they had the power to make decisions that would have assured the security of the dam. The corporate executives were indicted for qualified homicide with eventual intent, (when there is no intention to kill, but acceptance of the risk of death) in the deaths of 17 people. They were also indicted for causing flooding that threatens man or property; and for pollution of drinking water — the massive spill, Brazil’s largest mining disaster, reached the southern Atlantic Ocean. 17 are known dead in the worst mining disaster in Brazil’s history. Two are still unaccounted for. Photo by Romerito Pontes from São Carlos licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 2.0 Generic license. The indictments are part of an inquiry opened by the police to learn who is responsible for the failure of the Fundão dam. A second inquiry, planned for completion by March 22nd, is investigating Samarco and its parent companies, Vale and BHP Billington, for environmental crimes and possible dam licensing violations. The corporations, being legal entities, can only answer for environmental crimes and not for homicide. The police stated that the main cause of the dam breach was excessive water building up inside the impoundment. Drainage failures had been occurring since the tailings dam was inaugurated in 2008, according to reports issued by companies hired by Samarco. While the tailings storage capacity was expanded last year, the level of water flow had been declining throughout the years. In September, 2015, for instance, the water volume draining from the dam was lower than in April, 2014. “Instead of increasing, the water flow got reduced, and more liquid remained inside the dam,” said Otávio Guerra, a civilian police expert. That reduced flow caused a greater delay in the drying of waste and a buildup of water, which resulted in decreased stability and safety of the containment structure, until finally the dam gave way.

A massive wave of toxic mud swept away the lives of locals living below the mining waste impoundment.

In a statement in response to the homicide charges, Samarco said: “We consider mistaken the indictments and the precautionary measures of detention proposed by the police, and will wait for the court decision to take appropriate action.” The mining company statement went on to say that “since the breakup of the Fundão dam, Samarco and its shareholders (Vale and BHP Billiton) have launched an external investigation with the help of an internationally renowned company, and the participation of professionals from several fields, such as geotechnical engineers, geologists, engineers specialized in soil mechanics and fluids, and seismological experts.” A Samarco press officer informed Mongabay by email that the “internationally renowned company” in question is the U.S. law firm Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP. With offices in many parts of the world, the company also has a branch in São Paulo. Antonio Carlos de Oliveira, prosecutor of the Public Ministry of Minas Gerais, plans to present a formal complaint to the court of justice against the seven indicted on Friday, February 26th. However, he hasn’t said whether he will endorse the request for provisional arrest made by police chief Rodrigo Bustamante. Also on Friday, Samarco and its parent companies are scheduled to sign an extrajudicial settlement with the Federal Attorney General’s office. The document will detail how the mining companies are going to finance environment recovery and compensate those affected by the dam collapse and toxic spill. Officials continue to assess the death, destruction and ongoing environmental harm caused by the dam’s failure.

Stand by for further updates for the dam and additional guidance on recommended actions.”To clarify: Flash Flood WATCH in S. Oneida county was issued to SPECIFICALLY address possible hazards at the Trenton Falls dam due to excessive water. We can't stress enough that this is a WATCH and Watch means MONITOR closely. That's it. #nywx— NWS Binghamton (@NWSBinghamton) November 1, 2019 The watch is in effect until 9 p.m.Trenton town Supervisor Joseph Smith said he didn’t know much more about the potential dam failutre than what he read in the weather service alert.“I’ve been in the town for close to 30 years, and it’s the first time I’ve heard of a watch,” Smith said. “I think they’re being more cautious than anything. I went up and looked at the water a half hour ago, and it’s flowing pretty strong over the Hinckley Dam.”The hydroelectric project consists of two dams downstream from Hinckley Reservoir, Smith said. The reservoir, at the border of Oneida and Herkimer counties, is the source of drinking water for the city of Utica.The area near the reservoir was among the rainiest in the state Thursday night and this morning. More than 5 inches fell in Herkimer County, where one man was swept away by floodwaters.READ MOREHow much rain fell in Upstate NY in monster Halloween storm?

WESTMINSTER — Great River Hydro LLC officials told emergency planners and fire chiefs along the Connecticut River Tuesday they needed to prepare their communities "for the worst" in the event of a collapse of one of their dams.Emergency management planners from towns along the Connecticut were introduced to a set of interactive "inundation maps" that with the click of a mouse, show how much of Bellows Falls, Westminster, Putney, Brattleboro and Vernon - and their New Hampshire neighbors - would be under water in the event of a dam failure.Jud Donaghy, chief dam safety engineer for Great River, said the emergency planning is part of Great River Hydro's license with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Great River purchased the network of hydro dams on both the Connecticut and Deerfield rivers from TransCanada in April 2017.The scenarios outlined by Donaghy were astounding: in the event that the biggest dam in the Great River network, the Moore dam on the Connecticut between Littleton, N.H., and Waterford, Vt., failed, the release of the water behind it would trigger the failure of all the dams downstream in a cascade effect.Only Moore, Comerford and Wilder dams are "high hazard," and carry the potential to knock out the hydro dams downstream from them. Bellows Falls and Vernon do not have that potential, he said.On the Deerfield River, three Great River dams that have the "high hazard" designation are Somerset, Harriman and Sherman, which is located just over the state line in Massachusetts.He said the impact of a Harriman failure would be nothing short of a massive calamity for the tiny town of Readsboro, whose residents would be inundated in a matter of minutes with a wave of water more than 150 feet deep.The interactive maps, which were unveiled during a meeting at the Vermont State Police barracks Tuesday night, will also give planners an idea of how much time emergency crews have to evacuate people before the water arrives.While he admitted he was sketching the stuff of nightmares for emergency planners, he stressed that Great River was spending great time and resources on the dams' maintenance, to make sure nothing like what was outlined would ever happen. There were two different scenarios outlined for each dam, a "sunny day" catastrophe, or a storm scenario.But he said there were conditions beyond their control - a tremendous storm, or an earthquake, which could weaken or destroy a dam. Great River does have a "robust security system" for the dams, according to Matthew Cole of Great River Hydro.He said the Teton dam failure in Idaho in 1976, which killed 11 people and about 30,000 head of cattle, had triggered the planning for dam failure, he said.Support our journalism.

Any planner with the internet will be able to access the special inundation maps, he said."We hope never have to use them," he said, noting Great River Hydro employees do annual drills and emergency planning.Brattleboro Fire Chief Mike Bucossi said the new maps would be invaluable in helping do the emergency planning for Brattleboro. A portion of downtown Brattleboro would be inundated under some dam failure scenarios, he said. He said the flooding would be worse than during Tropical Storm Irene, which hit southern Vermont hard."For preparing people, this will be huge," he said, noting he needed to study the maps more closely.Susan Hammond, chairwoman of the Rockingham Select Board, said the session was very helpful to understand the impacts on the town.Donaghy said that while Irene had a major effect on many of the towns along the Connecticut and Deerfield rivers, dam failure and the sudden release of millions of gallons of water would be far worse.Donaghy said Great River was working to improve communication with not just state emergency planners but local towns.Donaghy and Cole, along with other Great River officials, are holding a series of meetings along the Deerfield and Connecticut rivers.In addition to sessions in White River Junction and Bradford, there will be a session at the Readsboro School in Readsboro on Oct. 9 at 5:30 p.m. There will be a similar session on Oct. 11 in South Deerfield at the Deerfield Town Hall.Contact Susan Smallheer at ssmallheer@reformer.com or 802 254-2311, ext. 154.

The Edenville Dam on the Tittabawassee River in central Michigan collapsed May 19, 2020, releasing a torrent that overtopped the downstream Sanford Dam and flooded the city of Midland. Damages exceeded 200 million. In a 502-page report, a forensic engineering team appointed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission described the Edenville Dam as flawed from the outset. Design and construction shortcomings in the 1920s were followed by years of operating and maintenance deficiencies that finally doomed the structure under pressure from the rain-swollen river. Despite the “natural desire” to point fingers at a single culprit, “the failure cannot reasonably by attributed to any one individual, group, or organization,” the report said. “Instead, it was the overall system for financing, designing, constructing, operating, evaluating and upgrading” the dams, “involving many parties during the nearly 100 years of project history, which fell short in ensuring a safe dam at the Edenville site.” The study team was led by John W. France, a 45-year dam safety consultant who has served on engineering review boards for federal and state agencies. The Edenville and Sanford were among four privately owned dams built around the same time on the roughly 72-mile-long (116.5 kilometers-long) river, creating a series of reservoirs. The Tittabawassee flows past Midland, about 130 miles north of Detroit, and intersects with the Saginaw River, which empties into Lake Huron. Each of the dams had earthen embankments, gated concrete spillways and structures for hydropower generation, although Edenville’s federal hydro license had been revoked in 2018. Throughout its history, “incorrect conclusions were drawn regarding the stability of the Edenville Dam embankments and the capacity of the spillways,” the report said. “The potential for a non-extreme rainfall event to result in the lake rising by several feet to near the embankment crest was not recognized, and judgments and decisions were made that eventually contributed to the failure or to not preventing the failure.” The collapse followed three days of heavy rain. Unlike at the other dams, Edenville’s gates weren’t lifted high enough to allow sufficient flow over the spillway from its reservoir, called Wixom Lake. When the dam gave way, the reservoir was about 5.5 feet (1.67 meters) above its normal level. The report discounted overtopping or internal erosion as causes of the failure, pointing instead to “static liquefaction,” which it describes as “a sudden loss of soil strength” in saturated, loose sands contained in a portion of the embankment. Use of such sands “significantly deviated from the design plans and construction specifications,” the report said. In some spots, including the one that failed, embankments were made with steep downstream slopes that didn’t meet modern safety requirements, it said. Occasional stability analyses during the 90-plus years of operation didn’t catch the defects, which could have been fixed. Dam engineers also failed to adequately consider potentially high runoff and lake levels, the report said, while spillway capacity wasn’t upgraded because the hydropower operations didn’t produce the millions of dollars needed to pay for it. “The dam failures were foreseeable and preventable,” it said.

Fear the Flood: Americans to Prepare for Possible Iraq Dam Collapse - ABC News ABC NewsVideoLiveShowsGuns in AmericaJan. 6LOG INInterest Successfully AddedWe'll notify you here with news aboutTurn on desktop notifications for breaking stories about interest? OffOnFear the Flood: Americans to Prepare for Possible Iraq Dam CollapseMosul Dam, “most dangerous dam in the world,” imperils 500K civilians.ByLee FerranMarch 01, 2016, 9:56 AM1:29A general view of the Mosul Dam in Mosul, 360 kilometers (225 miles) northwest of Baghdad, Iraq, Oct. 31, 2007.Khalid Mohammed/AP Photo&#151; -- Amid fears the “most dangerous dam in the world” could collapse unexpectedly, the U.S. government is urging Americans in Iraq to have a plan in place to escape the deluge that could drown Mosul and reach all the way to Baghdad.The U.S. Embassy in Baghdad issued a “security message” Monday announcing that the government of Iraq “is preparing to initiate emergency maintenance operations to reduce the risk of failure” to the Mosul Dam, the maintenance of which was interrupted in 2014 as the terror group ISIS temporarily took control of the gargantuan infrastructure project.The alert said the U.S. didn’t have “specific information that indicates when a breach might occur, but out of an abundance of caution, [officials] would like to underscore that advanced preparation and contingency plans for prompt evacuation offers the most effective tool to ensure safety.”Why Control of a Terrifying Dam in Iraq Is Life or Death for Half Million PeopleObama: Mosul Dam No Longer Under ISIS ControlDo you have information about this or another story? CLICK HERE to send your confidential tip in to Brian Ross and the ABC News Investigative Unit.The Mosul Dam, built on a terrible foundation in the 1980s, requires “extraordinary engineering measures” to fill in holes that constantly grow in the foundation in order to keep the dam operational in the best of times, according to a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) report in 2007.For more than 30 years -- and through several periods of violent conflict -- the Iraqi government has managed to keep the dam upright by continuously pumping in literally tons of grout like an industrial version of the little Dutch boy, as a geotechnical expert who worked on the dam described it to ABC News in August 2014.But if it were to collapse, U.S. officials said the result would be “catastrophic.”“[T]he most severe impact of a dam failure would be [for] the City of Mosul, located 50 kilometers [31 miles] downstream of the dam,” said an urgent letter from David Petraeus, then-commanding general of the U.S. Army, and Ryan Crocker, then-U.S. Ambassador to Iraq, to then-Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki in 2007. “Assuming a worse case scenario, an instantaneous failure of Mosul Dam filled to its maximum operating level could result in a flood wave over 20 meters [65 feet] deep at the City of Mosul, which would result in a significant loss of life and property.” The flood estimates for Mosul in Monday’s security alert are similar to those laid out in the 2007 letter.A 2011 report written by a USACE official and published in Water Power magazine estimated failure “could lead to as many as 500,000 civilian deaths.”Though pro-Iraqi government forces were able to recapture the dam from ISIS, they have not been able to liberate the city itself, home to an estimated 1.5 million people, now under ISIS control. Beyond the wall of water that could engulf that city, floodwaters, albeit at a lower level, could reach all the way to Baghdad, more than 200 miles further down the Tigris, depending on the performance of another smaller dam further downriver.In addition to flooding concerns, the dam is also a “key source” of power and water for the surrounding area, a State Department official told ABC News in 2014.CLICK HERE to read the alert and the embassy’s suggested courses of action.Top StoriesFauci experiencing Paxlovid rebound after testing positive for COVID this monthJun 29, 11:12 AMWoman walking with baby stroller shot to death in NYC4 hours agoFormer Trump White House counsel Pat Cipollone subpoenaed by Jan. 6 committee4 hours agoGOP must choose Trump or the Constitution, Liz Cheney warns: 'It is undeniable'4 hours agoTrump White House attorney disputes Hutchinson's testimony about handwritten noteJun 28, 11:07 PMABC News Live24/7 coverage of breaking news and live eventsABC News NetworkPrivacy PolicyYour CA Privacy RightsChildren's Online Privacy PolicyInterest-Based AdsAbout Nielsen MeasurementTerms of UseDo Not Sell My InfoContact UsCopyright © 2022 ABC News Internet Ventures.

On May 31, 1889, torrential rain and subsequent flooding caused the South Fork Dam to fail near Johnstown, Pennsylvania. Changes in ownership, lack of oversight, and unsound improvements increased the probability of a dam failure rather than prevent one. When the dam gave way, over 20 million tons of water caused a catastrophic torrent downstream. A 40-foot wave traveling 40 miles per hour crashed into Johnstown demolishing the town. National Dam Safety Awareness Day was created in memoriam to encourage and promote individual and community responsibility for dam safety and provide information on what can be done to prevent future dam failures. Additionally, this day promotes the benefits dams offer to communities. May 31 serves as a reminder to perform inspections, take necessary precautions for climate change patterns, update emergency action and evacuation plans, and share dam safety information with the communities. Dam safety is a shared responsibility. Know your risk, know your role, know the benefits of dams and take action. Be Dam Aware – learn more Dams provide many benefits including bringing water, power, flood control, recreation, and economic opportunities to communities. However, there are risks associated with dams, especially if a failure occurs. Be aware of dams in your area. Contact your local dam safety official for more information. Be prepared - Ask your city council for a copy of their Emergency Evacuation Plan and share with your neighbors. Since their enactment in 1948, USDA NRCS’ watershed programs have designed and built over 11,870 dams, constructed water storage structures, flood management systems, bank stabilization, relocated property, redirected stream flows, re-established wildlife habitat and more to save lives and protect watersheds. These programs play an important role in advancing the implementation of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. Under the Biden-Harris Administration, the USDA NRCS has invested 586.5 Million to address watershed resource concerns including 82 million to address safety and performance issues of high hazard dams.

Dam déjà vu: 2 Brazil mining waste disasters in 3 years raise alarms English中文 (Chinese)Deutsch (German)Español (Spanish)Français (French)Bahasa Indonesia (Indonesian)Italiano (Italian)日本語 (Japanese)Brasil (Portuguese)IndiaPhilippinesहिंदी (Hindi) RainforestsOceansAnimalsEnvironmentBusinessSolutionsFor KidsDONATEImpactMore Mongabay Series: Amazon Infrastructure Dam déjà vu: 2 Brazil mining waste disasters in 3 years raise alarms by Zoe Sullivan and Caio de Freitas Paes on 11 February 2019 Even as Brazil’s newly seated Bolsonaro administration calls for the gutting of environmental licensing rules and for other environmental deregulation, a January collapse of a Vale Mining tailings storage dam in Brumadinho, killing more than 150 people with more than 180 missing and feared dead, has outraged Brazilians.The disaster is the second such accident in barely three years. In November 2015, another Vale-affiliated dam collapsed, also in Minas Gerais state, killing 19 and polluting the Doce River for 500 miles all the way to the Atlantic Ocean. The two accidents now vie for designation as Brazil’s worst environmental disaster.Mongabay’s investigation of the 2015 accident response and the national and state inspection system, while not all encompassing, shows a high degree of long-term failure by government, by mining companies, and inspection consultants to adequately assess tailings dam risk, and to repair structurally deficient dams.Three years after the Fundão dam failure, government and mining companies have received poor marks from critics for victim compensation and fixes for socio-environmental harm. On February 7th, Brazil said it aims to ban upstream tailings dams (UTDs), the type that failed both times. No details were released as to how Brazil’s 88 existing UTDs would be dismantled. As of February 7, the Minas Gerais Fire Department Search and Rescue team had found 150 bodies in Brumadinho. Finding and extricating the often badly mangled bodies makes identification difficult. Image courtesy of the Minas Gerais Fire Department. Marlene Iaquil Serra, 57, is one of the lucky ones. She escaped her home before the toxic sludge engulfed it. Her elderly mother, gone to visit a relative’s newborn, was spared as well, even as others died, inundated by a wave of rust-colored sludge and rocky debris. These lucky escapes could describe events during the January 2019 Brumadinho Vale mining disaster. But they don’t. Serra escaped from Bento Rodrigues on November 5, 2015 when the Fundão tailings dam, operated by Samarco and owned by two of the world’s largest mining companies, Vale and BHP Billiton, collapsed killing nineteen, including two children. The 2015 Vale collapse dumped 50 million tons of iron mining waste into the Doce River, polluting it for 500 miles to the Atlantic Ocean, killing fish and other wildlife, and contaminating the drinking water for roughly 1.6 million Brazilians – including indigenous and traditional people who relied on the river for their livelihoods. The disaster initially caused Vale’s share price to tank as Brazilians condemned the company and lax governmental oversight. Three years later and Vale was again booming, but it is also presiding over a new flood of toxic mud. At lunchtime on January 25th, some 70 miles from Bento Rodrigues, the Feijão dam ruptured, spilling the same kind of iron mining waste, from the same sort of failed tailings dam that destroyed Bento, with far more deadly results. IBAMA, the Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Resources, has already issued five fines totaling nearly US68.5 million against Vale since the Brumadinho disaster. However, in the Bento Rodrigues dam collapse of 2015, the mining companies involved which include Vale, have resisted, and have not paid any of the fines. Image courtesy of Press Office/IBAMA. Marchers protest against Samarco, Vale and BHP Billiton after the 2015 Doce River Disaster. The sign reads: “Less mud, more life.” Photo by Zoe Sullivan. This new catastrophe, unleashing 11.7 million cubic meters (413 million cubic feet) of mining waste, obliterated sections of the community of Brumadinho. As of 6 February, 150 bodies – along with unidentifiable body parts – had been recovered, while 182 people are still missing, feared dead. “They need to think a little more about people, about human beings,” Serra said of Vale a few days after the latest catastrophe. “Those are lives. Vale makes a lot of money. Lives have no price. This has really affected people.” Samarco, which operated the Fundão dam, has taken care of Serra and other Bento survivors since 2015. The firm pays her rent and provides a prepaid credit card to cover her family expenses. She is also waiting, patiently, for the new home the company promised to build; she says it is supposed to be ready next year – four years after the rupture. The company told Mongabay it has spent 5.2 billion Reals (approximately US1.4 billion) repairing damages and compensating victims since the Bento dam collapse through the Renova Foundation, created to handle these responsibilities. Renova said it has provided financial support to approximately 300,000 people. The path of destruction taken by the toxic mine waste through Brumadinho knocked out a major bridge and swept away all evidence of its wreckage. Image by Vinicius Mendonça/IBAMA. When lightning strikes twice The Brumadinho tragedy has Brazilians asking: “How could this have happened again?” The answer is partly historical; the region has depended on mining since the Portuguese arrived in Brazil. But responsibility also lies with the failures of successive governments – both left and right – to adequately regulate and hold corporations to account. There’s another contributing cause: people need their mining jobs, so often just carry on when things go wrong. As of 2016, Minas Gerais, the state where both disasters happened, employed nearly 54,000 people in the mining industry, according to IBGE, the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics. In 2015, heavy industry – especially mining – accounted for more than R4.6 billion (roughly US 1.2 billion) flowing in and out of the city of Mariana where the Bento Rodrigues disaster occurred. The service industry, by contrast, accounted for only a third that much. This outsized economic footprint helps explain the power and privilege that the mining industry enjoys in the state ­– in spite of repeated industrial disasters. That overwhelming economic advantage may also explain why companies such as Vale take potentially terrible socio-environmental risks. For example, according to one report, Samarco was attempting to quintuple the size of the Fundão waste reservoir by connecting two different tailing dams when the 2015 collapse happened. Experts say tailings dams are risky because instead of being built on solid ground, they use mine waste as their base and walls. These materials can shift or “liquify,” as an investigation by Vale and BHP Group Ltd. found happened at the Fundão dam. Video of the 2019 Brumadinho collapse show what appears to be a similar liquefaction process in horrific detail, with cars and people swept to their deaths by a failed dam and a deluge of toxic mud. A diagram of the the Córrego do Feijão Mine upstream tailings dam, which isn’t really a dam  in the traditional sense. Instead of a strong dam wall made of concrete, solid mine waste (dark brown), is heaped to make a berm; then semi-liquid and solid waste is dumped in behind the berm. As levels raise, more solid mine waste is heaped atop the first, and staggered, to raise the “dam,” then more semi-liquid and solid waste is dumped in behind, and so on. The temptation is to make the dam too high; poor management, leaks, and heavy rains can all be problems with these types of dams.

A 2017 United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP) report, looking at tailings dams globally, found that “wet storage” of the type that destroyed both Bento Rodrigues and Brumadinho is responsible for most accidents and simply too dangerous to use. UNEP and its independent review panel, which including mining engineers, recommended a global shift to “dry stock storage” then, but mine operators have resisted because wet tailings disposal is cheaper than the dry storage method. Although elected officials, NGOs and local activists pushed for stricter dam regulations after the 2015 disaster, the former Governor of Minas Gerais instead authorized a rapid approval process for industrial projects, including mines and dams. The B1 dam that failed in Brumadinho was part of a complex that Vale received approval to expand under this new fast-track system. In November 2015, a massive wave of toxic mud swept away the lives of people living below the Fundão mining waste impoundment. The 2019 Brumadinho disaster is hauntingly similar, but with many times greater loss of life.

Brazil’s response to the 2015 disaster The Brazilian government did take some steps to respond to the Fundão dam collapse. Samarco’s Fundão mine remains closed, and in 2016, the National Mining Production Department (DNPM) – now renamed the National Mining Agency (ANM) – suspended approval of mining concessions which planned to use new upstream tailings dams of the type that destroyed Bento Rodrigues. However, that action only included dams that fit the National Dam Safety Policy specifications – meaning upstream tailings dams taller than 15 meters (49 feet) that hold more than 3 million cubic meters (more than 3.9 million cubic yards) of mining waste, with that waste considered to be dangerous or with dams having been found to have medium or high risks of fatal accidents in the event of collapse. The 2016 measure didn´t mention or regulate the dozens of existing upstream tailings dams across the nation, including the now collapsed B1 dam in Brumadinho. As for human and social losses, if the country’s response to the 2015 Fundão dam collapse is any indication, then the residents of Brumadinho and those living along the now polluted Paraopeba River could end up waiting many years to see their damage claims resolved. After the 2015 Fundão accident, instead of relying on the notoriously slow Brazilian judicial system to adjudicate compensation, the Renova Foundation, a private entity, was created as part of a judicial agreement (Terms of Transaction and Conduct Adjustment, TTAC), as a means to more quickly make reparations to impacted communities.However, “The Renova Foundation has proven to be a farce,” says Neto Barros, the mayor of Baixo Guandu, a city of 31,000 people on the Doce River heavily impacted by the toxic flood. The foundation “defends the interests of polluters,” Barros asserted. He said that the registration system that Samarco set up to list affected people, establishing eligibility for financial compensation and support, grossly undercounts the number harmed. “There are fisherfolk, there are farmers, there are a lot of people who haven’t been helped. The pollution they created in our river is absurd,” said Barros. People, wildlife, fish and other aquatic creatures died when toxic mud destroyed Bento Rodrigues and polluted 500 miles of the Doce River in 2015. Photo by Romerito Pontes from São Carlos licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 2.0 Generic license. Documented impacts include polluted drinking water drawn from the Doce River (clean ups have failed to make the water potable in many areas). A November report from Minas Gerais water agency, (IGAM), found that the stream still has high levels of metals such as manganese, aluminum and iron. Early reports from local communities say that the Paraopeba River downstream of Brumadinho is similarly polluted. The Vale dam rupture has already destroyed at least 269 hectares (665 acres) of native Atlantic Forest, according to satellite data analyzed by Brazil’s IBAMA National Environmental Monitoring and Information Center. Looking back at the 2015 Fundão dam failure, Samarco has paid exactly none of the 25 government fines, totaling 350.7 million Reals (US95.8 million), assessed against it by IBAMA, the country’s environmental agency. “The company insists on appealing administrative decisions, seeking to remove its responsibility for the disaster. None of the environmental fines have been paid so far,” confirmed IBAMA’s press team. The community of Baixo Guandu, to circumvent the long legal wait time and the low caps on potential compensation that apply in Brazil, has joined with 24 cities in a US6.5 billion lawsuit filed in the United Kingdom against BHP Billiton, which co-owned the Fundão dam with Vale. Also signing onto this UK suit are 240,000 individuals, 11,000 businesses, 200 Krenak indigenous people, and a Catholic archdiocese. Last November, just weeks before the newest dam disaster, the Renova Foundation reacted to the BHP Billiton court proceeding by offering 53 million Reals (around US14.4 million) in compensation to Doce River municipalities, but only on the condition they withdraw from the UK lawsuit. Nineteen people died in the Fundão mining waste disaster of 2015. Had Brazil and mining companies acted swiftly and decisively then to ban and decommission existing upstream tailings dams, the 2019 Brumadinho disaster could have been averted.

Criminal investigation stalled Prosecution of those allegedly responsible in the Fundão dam collapse has also foundered. Brazilian prosecutors filed a criminal case against 22 people and four companies in 2016. The bulk of the witnesses for the prosecution testified in mid-2018. However, in October two defendants were granted habeas corpus rulings that removed them from the criminal proceeding. As a result, a judge cancelled the remaining scheduled hearings, halting the case. Gustavo Oliveira, a Federal Public Ministry prosecutor in Minas Gerais, said that his office has filed a motion requesting the case move forward again. On the civil side, another prosecutor told Mongabay that in 2017 the companies agreed to pay for studies to determine the extent of the damage inflicted by the dam´s collapse. A plodding pace isn’t the only challenge facing Fundão legal proceedings. In December 2016, a little over a year after the dam’s collapse, a new Minas Gerais attorney general transferred six prosecutors working on the case to other posts. These prosecutors were highly qualified with years of experience on technical environmental cases. The terrific force of the toxic mud wave that hit Bento Rodrigues is attested to by this photo showing a car carried straight through a house. Samarco and some of its executives were charged with qualified homicide, but the case is currently in limbo.

Likelihood of future tailings dam failures unknown 2016 data, gathered by states’ environmental agencies for Brazil’s Integrated Mining Dam Safety Management System, found that 147 mining dams rated with the highest risks of fatal accidents were located in Minas Gerais state. This total represents more than 65 percent of the highest risk category across all of Brazil. Some of the highest-risk Minas Gerais dams are in populated areas, including the state capital Belo Horizonte and the town of Ouro Preto, a UNESCO World Heritage site known for its historic architecture. This raises serious safety concerns. As of 2016, nine other states had 77 tailings dams with the same level of high risk for fatal accidents. According to the ANM, Immediately following January’s Brumadinho disaster, the National Mining Agency (ANM) updated Brazil’s dam safety data. Unexpectedly, this new data doesn’t match up with the previous 2016 report Only a single gold mine dam in the Rio Acima municipality of Minas Gerais is found on both the 2016 and 2019 reports. Some of these dams, listed as high risk just three years ago, are not even mentioned in the latest data. “These dams may have been re-categorized, but I can’t assure you [of] their stability. We are still working on this data,” stated Eduardo Leão, a member of the ANM director board and Vale’s former Environment Director for the Carajás Project, the largest iron mine in the world, located in the Amazonian state of Pará.

Even when such dams remain intact, they and the mining facilities around them are still very environmentally destructive, causing major deforestation and potentially leaking toxic mining waste into aquifers and streams.

Inadequate government inspections Despite all of this uncertainty, the Brazilian government has concluded that mining impoundments in Minas Gerais and in other states pose a serious threat of collapse. In 2016, one year after the Samarco dam rupture, a Brazil Court of Auditors (TCU) presented the results of its investigation: “The country,” the TCU warned, “has latent and potential risks for new tailings-dams accidents.” According to that report, the former federal government’s Mining Production Department (DNPM) inspection process was “fragile, faulty and did not achieve the goals of the National Dam Safety Policy.” One of the more damning criticisms noted that while the department received and confirmed receipt of dam safety declarations about Brazil’s mining dams, it didn’t analyze the contents of those inspection reports. Dam safety inspections were also sporadic, done during rare onsite visits by DNPM inspectors. “There may be dams in operation that are [defaulting on] the requirements of Dam Safety Plans and Emergency Action Plans, including dams that did not prepare the respective documents, since the DNPM does not evaluate these documents, or even [know] whether they exist, except through on-the-spot inspections, when and if they happen,” said the 2016 auditors’ report. Fabio Schvartsman, Vale’s CEO, was chosen to lead the company in the aftermath of the Fundão disaster of 2015. The road ahead for Vale, after the Brumadinho catastrophe, could be difficult as the company and its management face great anger from Brazilians. Image by Valter Campanato/Agência Brasil. In 2012, for example, Samarco delayed sending information about the stability of the Fundão dam that eventually failed in Mariana. The company was only fined two years later, after irregularities were found. The auditors’ investigation also revealed systemic issues within the agency that undermine its ability to perform its duties. “The flaws and irregularities uncovered during this audit involve the agency’s institutional operations,” says the report. ANM’s Leão told Mongabay that: “Since 2016, our scenario hasn’t changed much: we still have budget issues and other challenges to conducting on-site monitoring. The report highlighted a number of shortcomings, and it’s not possible to fix the problems in such a short period of time.” More than 11 million cubic meters of mining waste swept away Vale’s administrative headquarters and rural communities below the Córrego do Feijão Mine dam. Many people are still missing. Image courtesy of the Minas Gerais Fire Department. Accidents waiting to happen One of the main critiques after the 2015 mining accident was that Samarco was allowed to monitor its own dam safety. The dam break in Brumadinho followed the same script: Vale was responsible for dam safety audits and for monitoring the stability of the Córrego do Feijão dam. This self-regulation process, however, was well within Brazilian law. Brazil’s current National Dam Safety Policy was created in 2010, and it essentially allows the private sector to regulate itself. As a result, companies are responsible for the safety reports of more than 700 mining tailings dams in Brazil. Experts say this is a conflict of interest. In fact, two engineers from a German external auditing company hired by Vale, gave “declarations of the condition of stability” for the Brumadinho dam last year before its collapse. Both were arrested in connection with the disaster but have since been released. Similar concerns were raised regarding positive external safety audits preceding the Fundão disaster. How does the government justify self-regulation and inspection by the mining industry? “The [mining] agency has been short of professionals for years, and we have reported that. There hasn’t been a civil service exam to hire new professionals since 2010, which results in responsibilities accumulating,” explained Paulo Ribeiro de Santana, a Mining National Agency geologist. Santana serves as an example of the agency’s overburdened staff. The geologist handles both technical and communication functions within the agency. “We currently have 851 employees. Of these, just over 300 are about to retire. We work longer to avoid worsening the situation,” he reports. “For all dams classified as high-risk – whether because of structural conditions or potential associated damage – we have determined responsive inspections with full-time video monitoring,” says Leão. “We have 740 mining tailings dams across the country and only 35 ANM inspectors. It’s impossible to monitor all of them: with this kind of [self-regulating] systems we could minimize these issues,” concludes the ANM director. The Pataxó Hã-hã-hãe indigenous group lives in Brumadinho’s neighbor city, São Joaquim de Bicas, which was downstream from the Vale dam break and impacted by it. They say that the toxic mining tailings have “killed” the Paraopeba River, which provided food for their community. Image by Lucas Hallel/FUNAI. Policies primed for more tailings-dam disasters A national trauma like the Samarco tailings-dam failure could have acted as a turning point for dam safety in Brazil. Instead, laws weren’t significantly toughened, and episodes with smaller socio-environmental impacts have occurred since then – including the 2018 leaks from the Hydro Alunorte aluminum processing waste dam in the Amazonian state of Pará, and two back-to-back Anglo-American iron mine slurry pipeline spills in Minas Gerais. Within days of the Brumadinho disaster, the ANM responded by issuing a press release announcing that “businesses with high-risk dams must maintain full-time monitoring when the dams have upstream construction and people in their flood map area.” But with an implementation deadline of June 16, 2019, the order lacked urgency. On February 7th, one of the directors of Brazil´s National Mining Agency (ANM) said it plans to ban upstream tailings dams. So far, no details have been released about how such a measure would be implemented, nor how the country´s 88 existing upstream tailings dams would be dismantled or converted. IBAMA has issued 5 fines so far totaling 250 million Reals (nearly US68.5 million) in the Brumadinho case. However, considering that none of the 2015 fines charged to Samarco have been paid, collecting such fines would require increased government enforcement and corporate compliance. President Bolsonaro (center) overflies the Brumadinho dam disaster. Past governments, both left and right, have failed to address Brazil’s dam safety issue, largely due to the immense power wielded by big mining companies such as Vale. Bolsonaro’s administration is moving swiftly to reduce environmental regulation, but its full response to the Vale disaster remains to be seen. Image courtesy of the Presidency of the Republic. The newly inaugurated Bolsonaro government has taken some other steps since the new Vale dam rupture. On January 29, a presidential decree recommended a broad evaluation of tailings dam safety in all states. The day after, the Water Resource National Council (CNRH) also recommended that state agencies update their tailing dams data. New reports are expected in 3 months. These recommendations all carry less weight than a federal administrative order. In recent years there have been legislative bills aimed at strengthening the agencies charged with monitoring tailings dams, such as the CNRH. But so far, mining interests have derailed these efforts, although the process by which the industry exercises its influence on government did shift between the administrations of Dilma Rousseff and Michel Temer. “Because electoral campaigns could be financed with corporate money during the Dilma administration, mining companies were strengthened through the legislative branch. They influenced politicians formulating bills, such as the new Brazilian Mining Code,” explained Bruno Milanez, a researcher at the Federal University of Juiz de Fora, in Minas Gerais. One example of industry influence includes a situation in which new mining code legislation was written on a computer belonging to a law firm that counts Vale Mining as a client. Deputy Leonardo Quintão, then responsible for shepherding the code through the legislative process, admitted that his run for Congress was funded by mining companies, Vale included. According to Milanez, as soon as Michel Temer became president, the mining industry’s approach to controlling policymaking changed. A pro-corporate regulatory approach was guaranteed by appointing mining company executives to important positions in the National Mining Agency and the Ministry of Mines and Energy. Bolsonaro’s industry-friendly appointments have been similar. Even a cursory study of the three years separating the Fundão and Brumadinho disasters suggests that – without the kind of ban now being proposed – more disasters could follow.

Aging dams could soon benefit from 7B federal loan programNews Sports Autos Business Michigan Life + Home Entertainment Opinion Obituaries MICHIGANAging dams could soon benefit from 7B federal loan programDavid A. LiebAssociated PressView Comments Eight years after Congress created the program, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is taking a first step toward offering more than 7 billion of federally backed loans to repair aging dams owned by states, local governments and private entities across the U.S.The Corps published a proposed rule for the low-interest loan program on Friday, starting a process that is expected to open applications for the aid in 2023, said Aaron Snyder, interim director of the Corps' Water Infrastructure Financing Program.The Corps' National Inventory of Dams lists more than 92,000 structures across the U.S., most of which are privately owned. The safety of the nation's dams has garnered increased public scrutiny in recent years, in part because of high-profile failures that forced the evacuation of thousands of residents in Michigan and California.In the case of the Michigan failures, an independent forensic team last month issued its final report on the causes behind the "foreseeable and preventable" failures of two dams that led to major, widespread flooding in Midland County.The team, hired by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to investigate the causes of failures, concluded poor construction practices at the 95-year-old Edenville Dam created the unstable soil conditions that kicked off the series of failures on May 19, 2020. The Edenville Dam failure caused the downstream Sanford Dam to fail.“There is a need to rehabilitate quite a number of our dams in the U.S.,” said Chuck Thompson, chief of the New Mexico Dam Safety Bureau and president of the Association of State Dam Safety Officials.But he added: “The rehabilitation of a large facility like a dam requires quite a bit of funding, and it’s the sort of thing that even the larger owners often struggle with.”A recent Associated Press analysis tallied more than 2,200 dams in poor or unsatisfactory condition that are classified as high-hazard, meaning their failure likely would unleash a flood killing at least one person. That figure was up substantially from a similar AP analysis three years earlier.The nation’s dams have an average age of 61 years and often pose a greater risk than when they were designed and constructed. Homes, businesses and highways have been built below dams that once were in remote locations. A changing climate with intense rainstorms has strained some dams beyond their original designs. Maintenance also has been deferred, often because dam owners lack the money to pay for it.The Association of State Dam Safety Officials estimates it could cost nearly 76 billion to rehabilitate the almost 89,000 dams owned by individuals, companies, community associations, states, local governments and other entities besides the U.S. government.The new federal loan program "puts a pretty good dent in the existing need,” Snyder said.Most states don't have grant or loan programs specifically targeted for repairing dams. Until recently, federal money for dam improvements also has been limited.Since 2019, the Federal Emergency Management Agency has divided nearly 32 million among 35 states and Puerto Rico to design and make repairs on high-hazard dams. Last year's infrastructure law pumped an additional 585 million into that program, including 75 million set aside for dam removal. It also provided 118 million to rehabilitate aging dams built through the National Resources Conservation Service, among other things.But all that pales in comparison to the billions of dollars in loans soon to be available through the Corps."This program is critically important to provide improved public safety, reduce risk to vulnerable communities, and enhance climate resiliency to bring our aging infrastructure into the future,” Michael L. Connor, assistant secretary of the Army for civil works, said in a statement announcing the proposed rule.The Corps' loan program was authorized under a 2014 law that also enabled water system loans from the Environmental Protection Agency. The EPA has provided 88 loans totaling 15 billion from 2018 through this year.But until recently, Congress had not set aside money specifically for dam-related loans. Consequently, the Corps hadn't developed rules needed to issue loans for those repairs, Snyder said.That changed in December 2020 when Congress began taking a series of steps appropriating money to support the loan program. It got a big funding boost from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act signed by President Joe Biden last November.Under the proposed rule published Friday, the loans would be available only for projects of at least 20 million, though repairs on multiple dams could be bundled to reach that threshold, Snyder said. Loans generally could cover up to 49% of the costs. But that could extend up to 80% of the costs for projects serving “economically disadvantaged communities” with low-income levels, persistent poverty or high unemployment.Recipients could have up to 35 years to repay the loans.View Comments Staff Directory Site Map Legals Terms of Service Privacy Policy Your California Privacy Rights / Privacy PolicyDo Not Sell My Info / Cookie PolicyContact Us Advertise Your Business Buy and Sell Licensing & Reprints Help Center Subscriber Guide My Account Give FeedbackSubscribe Today Newsletters Mobile Apps Facebook Twitter E-Edition Archives RSS FeedsJobs Cars Homes Classifieds Renvy.com Michigan.com© 2022 www.detroitnews.com.

Look back: Why Horsetooth Reservoir was nearly drainedNews Sports Business NoCo Life Opinion Obituaries E-Edition Legals Look back: Why Horsetooth Reservoir was nearly drainedJacy Marmadukejmarmaduke@coloradoan.comView CommentsView CommentsIt's hard to imagine now, with snow melt starting to fill Horsetooth Reservoir, but the man-made lake that quenches Fort Collins' thirst was once little more than a mud puddle.The year was 2001, and Horsetooth Reservoir and its four dams had just turned 50. They were over the hill.And their signs of age were hard to ignore, even cloaked in the arcane language of bureaucratic reports: Increased seepage. Heightening foundation pressures. A lack of protective measures to prevent internal erosion.In the worst of all possible scenarios, water seeping through the dam cores could make them disintegrate, causing what bureaucrats call a “rapid failure.”In other words, a dam could break, swiftly and without warning.If that happened, "all or parts of the communities of Fort Collins, Timnath, Windsor, Greeley, Kersey along with other towns in Larimer and Weld counties, would be severely damaged or destroyed,” read a Bureau of Reclamation study cited in a June 2000 Coloradoan article.More: The Way It Was, a Podpast PodcastThe economic impact of such a disaster: 6.4 billion.The story of the 77 million repair project that nearly drained Horsetooth is one worth telling as Fort Collins approaches its rainiest season, just a few months removed from the high-profile emergency at the Oroville Dam in California. Extreme rains threatened that dam's spillway and raised the possibility of the structure failing and unleashing an uncontrolled torrent of water on residents.Nearly 15 years later, as mountain snowpack thaws and Horsetooth is nearly 90 percent full, let's reflect on the two-and-a-half-year revamp that shielded Fort Collins from the possibility of a dam disaster.The projectNo one argued that failure was imminent for Horsetooth's dams.They were still passing U.S. Bureau of Reclamation inspections. They behaved the way they were supposed to, even absorbed some of the blow of Fort Collins’ historic 1997 flood, when more than a foot of rain pounded the city in 31 hours.But in the geeky, complex world of dam design, you prepare for worst-case scenarios. And besides, a dam failure wasn't unheard of in Northern Colorado: The Lawn Lake dam failure of 1982 killed a man and sent a deluge of water through downtown Estes Park.So it was time to give Horsetooth a makeover."What makes it urgent is that there are so many people and so much population downstream from the dams that we need to take action," Bureau of Reclamation engineering and construction liaison Beth Boaz said at the time.Horsetooth’s four dams – Soldier Canyon, Spring Creek, Dixon and Horsetooth – were outfitted with clay cores to make them waterproof.Here’s the thing about old dams, though: They leak. Water is really good at finding the easiest path of resistance to head downstream.By the 2000s, water was starting to seep through the Horsetooth dams. Not a lot. But it was enough to get the Bureau of Reclamation’s attention. And, in the unlikely scenario that an earthquake hit Northern Colorado, the Bureau of Reclamation folks weren’t certain the aging dams would remain intact."They were built in the 1940s with 1940s technology," Northern Water Conservancy District spokesman Brian Werner said. "We needed to bring them into the 21st century."More: Stout: The lost town at the bottom of HorsetoothAfter some deliberation, the Bureau of Reclamation, which served as the project leader, decided to blanket the dam’s clay cores with 10-foot layers of sand and fine gravel that would keep them dry. They’d build fortifying buttresses on each dam’s downstream side.First, they’d have to nearly drain Horsetooth.The Bureau of Reclamation restricted water levels to 5,360 feet – 70 feet below full – during construction. At various points, Horsetooth was down to “dead pool” storage – about 7,000 acre feet, or roughly 5 percent capacity.Northern Water general manager Eric Wilkinson, who was born and raised in Fort Collins, can still remember how strange it looked.“Obviously, you don’t ever want to see an empty reservoir,” he added. “But personally, I thought it was impressive -- the work that was done and the time frame in which they carried it out.”They kept just enough water in Horsetooth to meet users' needs during the irrigation season, storing the rest in the western reaches of the Colorado-Big Thompson Project.Workers found all sorts of stuff on the floor of the mostly bare dams and reservoir. Dinosaur fossils. A 1950s Porsche of mysterious provenance. The remnants of at least one building foundation from Stout, the quarry town that once touched the south end of Horsetooth Reservoir.And they found another reason for the seepage at Horsetooth Dam.Most of the surface below Horsetooth is made of sandstone. But there’s also a seam of limestone called the Forelle formation, which runs in starts and stops from the Bellevue area all the way to Carter Lake.More: Why Fort Collins had such a weird winterThe geological uprising that created the scenic hills east of the reservoir made some of that brittle limestone become crinkly. Grout injected in the cracks long ago wasn’t standing up to the test of time.So they dug down into the Horsetooth Dam, injected more grout and added a clay blanket to the upstream side of the dam. They put a layer of thick plastic on top of that.By November 2003, the work was basically done. The reservoir was finally starting to fill by that spring. Water sloshed across long-exposed banks and boat ramps re-opened. As Horsetooth filled, a historic drought came to a close.The people of Northern Colorado had their reservoir back.But someday, Horsetooth will have to dry up again. The modernized dams will eventually become outdated.Wilkinson won’t say when that will happen.“Nobody can really know that,” he said. “But right now, it’s state-of-the-art. It’s performing very well. I think monitoring of the dams in the last 15 years has shown that they did a good job.”More: 6 ways to celebrate Earth Day in Fort CollinsHow Horsetooth is different from OrovilleWhat happened at the Oroville Dam in February is unlikely to occur at any of the Horsetooth Reservoir dams, according to officials from the Bureau of Reclamation and Northern Water. That's partially because of the modernization project, but there are also a few other reasons. One is magnitude: The amount of water released through the Oroville Dam in 24 hours is more than Horsetooth Reservoir could hold at full capacity.Also, Horsetooth Reservoir's relationship to its dams and water sources is different from Lake Oroville's relationship with the Oroville Dam and the Feather River, which the dam impounds to form the lake. No river runs into Horsetooth Reservoir; gravity transports water there from other reservoirs in the Colorado-Big Thompson Project.The Bureau of Reclamation in June 2016 finished a comprehensive review of Horsetooth Reservoir's dams.

Six experts chosen to investigate cause of Edenville Dam failureNews Sports Autos Business Michigan Life + Home Entertainment Opinion Obituaries MICHIGANSix experts chosen to investigate cause of Edenville Dam failure Beth LeBlancThe Detroit NewsView Comments Michigan and federal regulators have signed off on six independent experts who will investigate why mid-Michigan's Edenville and Sanford dams failed in mid-May. The team, which held its first virtual meeting Wednesday, will be paid and contracted by dam owner Boyce Hydro, but were screened and approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the state Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy. The investigation is expected to take 18 months to complete, but the group could issue preliminary reports if there are discoveries that may help the state to mitigate potential failures at other dams, the state environmental department said in a Thursday statement. “With the knowledge and experience these professionals bring to the independent investigation, I am confident that we will get a clear picture of what went wrong with the two dams and why,” EGLE Director Liesl Clark said in a statement. “Transparency is extremely important as this process moves forward, and EGLE is ready to provide any information necessary to help get answers to this tragedy.”Both FERC and EGLE had requested the investigation after the Edenville Dam broke May 19, sending a surge of water downstream and over the top of the Sanford Dam and flooding the Midland area. Boyce Hydro had been scolded by federal authorities for more than a decade prior to the break. In 2018, federal regulators revoked the Edenville Dam's hydropower generation license and ceded jurisdiction to the state. At the time of the dam's break, state regulators were pursuing litigation over unauthorized drawdowns that led to the deaths of millions of freshwater mussels and seeking to confirm reports and measurements that indicated the Edenville Dam did not meet state flood capacity requirements. House Speaker Lee Chatfield, R-Levering, had called for an independent investigation after saying questions remained about the state's involvement in the dam failures.John W. France, president of JWF Consulting and expert in engineering consulting and design, will lead the team.Other members include dam engineering expert Irfan A. Alvi, hydromechanics expert Henry T. Falvey, hydraulics structure engineer Steve Higinbotham, water resources expert Arthur C. Miller and geotechnical engineer Jennifer Williams. Some team members were consulted in the investigation of the failure of the Oroville Dam in California in 2017, according to EGLE.On May 27, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer requested state agencies to review several aspects of the dam break, including the storm, dam structure, compliance and the transition from federal to state authority. She also asked the department to explore Michigan's dam safety priorities and provide recommendations in a report on the matter. Whitmer asked for a "preliminary account of what happened" by Aug. 31.eleblanc@detroitnews.comView Comments Staff Directory Site Map Legals Terms of Service Privacy Policy Your California Privacy Rights / Privacy PolicyDo Not Sell My Info / Cookie PolicyContact Us Advertise Your Business Buy and Sell Licensing & Reprints Help Center Subscriber Guide My Account Give FeedbackSubscribe Today Newsletters Mobile Apps Facebook Twitter E-Edition Archives RSS FeedsJobs Cars Homes Classifieds Renvy.com Michigan.com© 2022 www.detroitnews.com.

The rainstorm that hit mid-Michigan beginning on Sunday, May 17, though, proved one for the history books.The flooding that resulted from up to 7 inches of rain in Midland, Saginaw and surrounding counties damaged homes and property, forced more than 10,000 people to evacuate and most spectacularly destroyed one power dam and severely damaged another.It’s being called a 500-year flood event, meaning it is only likely to occur once every 500 years.How did it unfold?The story starts with the storm itself. One key ingredient fueled the downpour. MLive meteorologist Mark Torregrossa said the heaviest rain was produced by tropical moisture, as Tropical Storm Arthur was churning off the Mid-Atlantic coast.In what he called a conveyor belt effect, a mass of moisture traveled from the East Coast westward into Michigan, allowing the ongoing storm to tap into that tropical moisture and cause a substantial increase in rainfall totals.Total storm rainfall for Michigan's Lower Peninsula, from 5/17 to 5/19. Image courtesy of the National Weather Service.Mid-Michigan received a heavy amount of moisture from the storm, with Midland, Bay and Saginaw Counties floating around 3-4 inches of rain. The heaviest rainfall totals were found to the north, with Au Gres receiving 8.10 inches, East Tawas getting 7.97, and Sterling clocking in at 7.20 inches.The rainfall itself caused headaches for various municipalities, with Bay City’s wastewater treatment plant requiring the use of an auxiliary pump to keep up with the sudden deluge of water the evening of Monday, May 18.Numerous roads closed due to the heavy rain, especially in counties in northern mid-Michigan, with Arenac and Gladwin County beginning to see numerous road closures during the night on Monday.“Many roads have washed away. What may appear to be standing water may be much deeper than you believe. As it gets darker, you will not be able to see the flooded areas. Unnecessary travel ties up resources if you end up stranded. Please stay home if you do not absolutely need to be traveling,” said an alert from the Arenac County Sheriff’s Department that night.The Arenac County Sheriff’s Department stated that U.S. 23 was closed at the time between M-65 and Standish due to possible bridge damage and water over the road and at Omer. The Sheriff’s Department evacuated the areas around Townline, Pinnacle, Franklin Trail, and Miller roads today due to flooding that same day.As the floodwaters began to make their way through the watershed, areas downstream on the Tittabawassee River also were advised of potential severe flooding Monday night as all flood gates at the Sanford Dam were being opened due to high water. This action served as a forewarning as the next phase of the disaster started to take shape.A catastrophic chain of eventsMidland County Central Dispatch issued an alert at 12:22 a.m. on Tuesday, May 19, stating residents in Edenville Township needed to leave their homes due to an “imminent dam failure" at the Edenville Dam and that those who live along Sanford Lake and Wixom Lake were to vacate their homes and head to shelters immediately.Residents were directed to emergency shelters that were setup at Meridian Junior High School in Sanford and Coleman Community High School in Coleman.At 6:50 a.m. on Tuesday, Midland County Emergency Management determined that the structures such as the Edenville and Sanford dams were structurally sound but that the dams could not control or contain the water flowing through spill gates anymore.Later that day, things took a turn for the worse. A section of the dike at the Edenville Dam collapsed just after 6 p.m. after it couldn’t hold anymore of the swollen river.The collapse prompted flash flood warnings from the National Weather Service that read, "Life threatening flash flooding of areas downstream from the Edenville Dam along the Tittabawassee River,” the warning reads. “The nearest downstream town is Sanford Dam...located about 7 miles from the Edenville Dam. Areas downstream from the Edenville Dam along the Tittabawassee River should be prepared for additional flooding.”Midland County Emergency Management confirmed later on Tuesday, May 19, that water was flowing over the earthen embankment of the Sanford Dam after the Edenville failure sent a torrent of water into Sanford Lake. After overwhelming the Sanford Dam, the water surged south along the Tittabawassee River toward downtown Midland.The flooding from the event closed roadways such as eastbound and westbound US-10 between River Road and M-30 on Tuesday, per the Michigan Department of Transportation Bay Region Twitter page. The M-30 bridge was destroyed near Stryker’s Marina.Gov. Gretchen Whitmer issued an emergency declaration late Tuesday and sent the National Guard to help after the dam failure while also urging residents in evacuation zones to get out immediately.“Please, get somewhere safe now,” she said in a 10 p.m. Tuesday, May 19, press conference.About 10,000 people were evacuated, in Midland along with the village of Sanford, Edenville and Dow Chemical. Officials also were trying at the time to evacuate areas of Tittabawassee Township, Thomas Township and Saginaw Township, said Whitmer.The Tittabwasee River was reported to have crested at about 35 feet on Wednesday evening. The crest topped the river’s 1986 all-time record level, but falls short of the dire 38-foot mark that was predicted.A look at the Sanford Dam on Wednesday, May 20, 2020. After the Edenville Dam failed and the Tittabawassee River flooded surrounding areas, many residents were urged to leave their homes and to brace themselves for the possibility of the Sanford Dam to collapsing. Water flowed over the top of it through the night, but the structure is still in place. (Kaytie Boomer | MLive.com)Kaytie Boomer | MLive.comWhile the Edenville Dam fell to the floodwaters, the Sanford managed to hold its ground but did not come out of the situation unscathed. A hole formed at the dam’s brim Thursday, May 21, causing water to flow freely from the lake.Midland City Manager Brad Kaye on Thursday confirmed that as of 10 a.m. that the structure was still standing. He said that there is water over the top of the earthen berm portion with a substantial washout, but the concrete structure of the dam itself remains standingMore than just a structural failureThe resulting flood from the Edenville Dam collapse displaced about 10,000 people and prompted federal energy regulators to order Boyce Hydro to conduct a third-party investigation.It was reported in 2018 that federal energy regulators yanked the Edenville Dam operator’s license out of concern the spillway couldn’t pass enough water to avert a failure during a historic flood. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) records showed that capacity issues at the Edenville Dam spillway were cited as problematic dating back to the late 1990s.Gov. Gretchen Whitmer delivers remarks on Midland-area flooding at a press conference in front of Midland High School on Wednesday, May 20, 2020 in Midland, Mich. Gov. Whitmer surveyed flood damage from a helicopter earlier in the morning.Riley Yuan | MLive.comMichigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer vowed that the state will pursue every line of legal recourse and she suggested that such critical infrastructure should not be in private hands.“We can talk about the merits of whether or not private companies should own critical infrastructure or not - I don’t think that they should - but that’s what we’re dealing with here,” she said.The governor also took an aerial tour of the flood zone along the Tittabawassee River by helicopter on Wednesday and gave a press conference at Midland High School, which is being used as a shelter for residents displaced by flooding.President Trump also weighed in with a tweet thanking first responders for helping to evacuate people in the danger zone below the dams.What’s next?By Friday, homeowners slowly started to return to their homes, as they have been able and as flooding conditions have allowed. Families have been returning home to find muddy and water damaged homes as they work to pickup the pieces together. Wixom and Sanford Lakes were reported to be nothing more than mud puddles after their contents were swept downstream into the Tittabawassee.A nearly barren Wixom Lake stands dry after severe flooding forced the failure of Edenville Dam on Wednesday, May 20, 2020 in Edenville Township north of Midland. (Jake May | MLive.com)The Flint Journal, MLive.comPresident Trump approved an emergency declaration on Thursday, May 21 for areas affected by the water. Federal assistance will begin to supplement state and local responses starting Saturday, May 16.The City of Midland will soon begin cleanup efforts, as well. The city will make announcements regarding landfill access and debris collections to help residents with cleanup efforts, said Selina Tisdale, a public information officer for the city. Residents are now able to report damage to their property online here.The American Red Cross compiled a list of locations in Midland and Saginaw counties where displaced residents may seek shelter, food or other assistance and offers an online service to help friends and relatives to try and contact missing loved ones.Subsequent downstream flooding occurred in Saginaw County, where the community of Shields was flooded and residents in part of Spaulding Township were told to evacuate after a dike was breached.Memorial Day weekend in 2020 will be a busy time of cleanup, repair and reflection for those impacted by the flooding. Though remarkably there are no reports of any serious injuries or deaths attributed to the event, the damage to homes, businesses and properties will take time to repair.One family living in Sanford was busy picking through the muddy debris of their destroyed home, hoping to salvage some family pictures.“Thirty-one years and our whole life is gone,” Pat Perry said in the early evening of Thursday, May 21. “The thing that bothers me most are things like pictures that you can’t replace. Those are most important. The other stuff is just stuff.”Note to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission.DisclaimerRegistration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement, Privacy Policy and Cookie Statement, and Your California Privacy Rights (User Agreement updated 1/1/21.

Photo: Paul Kitagaki Jr./The Sacramento Bee via AP March 19, 2017 Henry W. Burke KEYWORDS California Department of Water Resources / dam safety / Oroville Dam Order Reprints 9 Comments On Sunday, Feb. 12, California officials ordered the immediate, mandatory evacuation of 188,000 residents from towns below the Oroville Dam. Two days later, when federal and state officials deemed the dam safe, the evacuation order was rescinded, and people were allowed to return to their homes. It isn't often that hundreds of thousands of people in the U.S. have to leave their homes because of worries about a catastrophic structural failure.As an experienced civil engineer, I would like to make one point very clear: Oroville Dam was never in danger of failing. Because the Oroville Dam crest is 21 ft higher than the emergency spillway crest, the dam will never be overtopped. "As an experienced civil engineer, I would like to make one point very clear: Oroville Dam was never in danger of failing." But the California Dept. of Water Resources must take this opportunity to design a lasting replacement for the destroyed spillway. I'll explain why.Located on the Feather River about 65 miles north of Sacramento, Calif., Oroville Dam is 770 ft high—the nation's tallest. Unlike Hoover Dam and Glen Canyon Dam, Oroville Dam is a zoned-earthfill structure.Water can be released from the reservoir (Lake Oroville) behind the dam in four ways: power plant, river outlets, main spillway and emergency, or auxiliary, spillway. Because rock debris is damming up the powerhouse tailrace, the Oroville power plant is out of service. Due to various operational problems, the river outlets cannot be used. This leaves only the main spillway and the emergency spillway to let water out of the lake. The main spillway is a 3,050-ft-long, concrete-lined chute, which extends from the flood-control outlet structure down to the Feather River. The gated headworks at the outlet structure has eight radial gates to meter water flow into the spillway chute. The main spillway is rated at 150,000 cubic ft per second (cfs). The final component for releasing floodwaters from Lake Oroville is the emergency, or auxiliary, spillway. This is a concrete, 30-ft-high ungated overflow weir, with a crest length of 1,730 ft. When floodwater passes over this weir, the water tumbles down an unlined slope to the Feather River. A relocated main spillway could be inserted between the existing spillway and the dotted lines in this simplified plan view of the dam and related structures. Image: Wikimedia Commons Heavy Rainfall Spikes Lake Levels After large storms hit the Feather River tributaries in early February, Lake Oroville water levels began rising dramatically. Normally, this doesn’t happen until the snow melts and the spring rains bring additional water into the reservoir. These early thunderstorms had a tremendous impact on the reservoir behind Oroville Dam. From February 6 to 11, high inflows entered Lake Oroville, with four days over 100,000 cfs.  On February 8, the reservoir took in a whopping 240,000 acre-feet of water in a 24-hour period.  Over the course of six days from February 6 - 11, Oroville Lake levels rose a gigantic 52 feet! On February 11, the lake rose three feet and water started flowing over the emergency spillway shortly after 8:00 a.m.  This was the first time that water had moved over the emergency spillway (Auxiliary Spillway) since Oroville Dam was built in 1967.  Water continued flowing over the Emergency Spillway until 8:00 p.m. on February 12.The California Dept. of Water Resources estimates that about 6,000 to 12,600 cfs of water passed over the emergency spillway on Saturday and Sunday (Feb. 11 and 12).  (Through independent calculations, I verified that the spillway discharge capacity is 6,000 – 13,000 cfs.)  When compared with the main spillway releasing 100,000 cfs, “this is a drop in the proverbial bucket.”As the water made its way down the steep slope to the Feather River, significant erosion took place.  Huge canyons were carved out of the hillside and sections of the boat ramp access road were destroyed. The Spillway ProblemsOf particular concern was the erosion that took place at the toe of the emergency spillway. After the emergency spillway stopped flowing, engineers could assess the damage that took place on Saturday and Sunday. Holes near the 30-ft-high emergency spillway were readily apparent. Some people feared that this concrete weir would be undermined and fail, thereby releasing a 30-ft-high wall of water onto the towns below the dam. This is why the authorities called for the immediate and mandatory evacuation. Henry W. Burke To prevent future damage when using the Emergency Spillway, workers armored the slopes with rocks and concrete.  The problems with the main spillway were brought to light on February 7, when a large hole appeared in the spillway concrete slab, near the location of an earlier patch job.  By February 10, the spillway crater had grown to 500-ft. long x 300-ft. wide x 45-ft. deep. In the process, the concrete side wall collapsed and was washed away. As the crater got larger, more and more water shot out of the spillway and carved a new canyon that carries the water down to the Feather River.  Depending on the flow volume, most of the water leaves the spillway chute at the location of this large crater. What caused the failure of the main spillway concrete slab?Main Spillway SolutionsOn February 14, I sent a letter to Dept. of Water Resources, in which I suggested that the concrete in the main spillway chute had been destroyed by powerful “cavitation” forces.  Cavitation can occur in spillways and tunnels when high-velocity water encounters irregularities in the concrete surface.  At these locations, cavitation creates high-pressure shock waves capable of destroying solid concrete.  Proper aeration of the water flow can minimize the harmful effects of cavitation.The department should immediately design the main spillway replacement so that construction can take place this summer, during the low-flow season.  The department has placed the rebuilding cost of the Main Spillway at about 200 million. Besides tough site conditions, the biggest obstacle could be the need to handle main spillway water flows during construction.  How will the contractor divert 60,000 – 100,000 cfs of high-velocity water around the repair site during construction?  Because this will be extremely difficult, construction must be pursued on a “24/7” basis to accomplish all work in the dry season.A logical alternative is to design a new main spillway chute to replace the 50-year-old spillway.  Of course, anti-cavitation measures would be incorporated into the new design, along with new energy dissipation features at the Feather River.The new spillway chute would have an alignment almost parallel with the existing spillway, a short distance to the northwest.  Most of the construction work could be accomplished even if the existing spillway has to carry water.  When the new spillway chute is built, it will be tied into the existing spillway near the gated headworks with a training wall at a very shallow angle.On February 27, the Dept. of Water Resources closed the gates in the Main Spillway. With no water flowing, people could see how rushing water can utterly destroy a weakened concrete spillway. Roughly half of the spillway’s length has been reduced to short stretches of concrete, rubble and huge canyons. The department kept the Main Spillway gates closed from February 27 to March 17.  During this period, contractor crews removed about 1.25 million cubic yards of rock and concrete debris from the Feather River, allowing partial operation of the powerhouse turbines.  Beginning March 17, the department is releasing around 50,000 cfs of water down the damaged main spillway to lower Lake Oroville water levels.Because of the heavy destruction, total replacement of the main spillway in a new location becomes even more attractive -- and that is the course of action I urge the department to take.

(Image courtesy of Vinícius Mendonça | Ibama) Brazilian iron ore miner Vale (NYSE: VALE) has published the results of an independent report into the Córrego do Feijão mine’s tailings dam collapse that killed 270 people last year, which reveals the company knew about the facility’s fragile condition since 2003. According to the document, prepared by a committee formed by Vale last year, concerns about how unstable the main B1 dam was were raised at various points over the course of 16 years, but the miner failed to appropriately deal with them. Sign Up for the Iron Ore Digest Sign Up Concerns about how unstable the main B1 dam was were raised at various points over the course of 16 years, but Vale failed to address them Last month, state prosecutors charged Fabio Schvartsman, the chief executive at the time of the burst, and 15 other people with homicide. Schvartsman left his position at the company in March 2019. They also charged Vale and its German contractor, TUV SUD, with environmental crimes, as the burst unleashed an avalanche of muddy mining waste that polluted the nearby town of Brumadinho, water streams and agricultural land. The independent committee, led by former Federal Supreme Court minister Ellen Gracie, concluded the tailings storage facility’s rupture was triggered by structural instability caused by liquefaction. The situation, it says, was worsened by a series of other factors, including inadequate drainage of the reservoir and the fact the dam was not designed to contain liquefied material. Previous reports The tragic incident has triggered over the past year several criminal investigations, including a global inquiry into the status of 726 tailing dams. In mid-December, the company released a long-awaited report from a panel of experts on the technical causes of the dam failure at the mine in Brumadinho. The report found that the failure was “unique” as it occurred “with no apparent signs of distress prior to failure.” That document acknowledged that parts of the dam were under very high loading due to its steepness, the heavy weight of the tailings and the high internal water level. “The combination of a steep upstream-constructed dam, high water level, weak fine tailings within the dam, and the brittle nature of the tailings created the conditions for failure,” it concluded.

The investigating team provided recommendations of technical and governance nature, adding that Vale should evaluate the potential risks at other similar dam structures. The iron ore giant responded by saying it had already addressed most of the issues mentioned in the recommendations, taking steps to improve its internal controls. The Rio de Janeiro-based miner, which posted this week a loss of 1.68 billion in 2019, said it will announce a timetable for implementing the proposed actions within 30 days.

Who knows what kind of infiltration gallery developed…internal saturated zones…high pore pressures, overloaded segments and likely perched water tables backed up against the retention berm. These are all common geotechnical issues. Uncommon ones might include authigenic clays growing within the mix. My experience with geotechnical engineering theory for civil structures did not point to geochemistry or mineralogy…only soil mechanics and hydro.

Auditor-General Michael Pickup said there are hundreds of high-risk structures around the province that are not properly regulated, posing a threat to people, property and the environment.“The ministry is not effectively overseeing the safety of dams,” Mr. Pickup said in an interview. “It’s concerning. That increases the risks that dam owners might not meet the requirements for safety, and it increases the risk that their dams could threaten public safety.”B.C. has 1,000 regulated dams, built for electricity, irrigation and flood control, that are rated “high-consequence” – meaning that a failure could kill people, or damage the environment and property.While owners are responsible for the safety of their dams, the Ministry of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development is supposed to ensure compliance with safety regulations.In his report, the Auditor-General found a series of gaps in oversight, including that nearly 200 dams that should have been regulated were not.While the provincial government accepts all nine of his recommendations for change, Mr. Pickup said he was troubled by the province’s vague commitments to fix the problems he identified.“There’s an agreement that ‘we will do something,’ but it’s short on detail as to what’s going to be done, and when it is going to be done,” he said.The review identified 87 high-risk dams around the province with significant deficiencies that had not addressed their safety problems for more than seven years, on average.“The ministry did not promptly and effectively follow up with dam owners to enforce compliance with key regulatory requirements or to correct physical deficiencies,” the report found.The review also points to reliance on overworked staff and a clunky database that was riddled with errors.In a sample of dams listed in the government’s database, more than half were missing key information. And almost half of dam safety officers had a backlog of reports to review on whether high-consequence dams are safe. Some dams that require audits have not been audited. The ministry also has no process to track down unregulated dams, and the average time to approve safety reports is 20 months – but some took as long as eight years to process.“The ministry can’t properly oversee dam owner compliance with the regulations without reliable information, nor can it adequately monitor dam safety or prioritize program resources,” the report noted.The B.C. government committed to improve dam safety after a massive tailings pond collapsed at Mount Polley in 2014, spilling 25 million cubic metres of pollutants into Quesnel Lake in B.C.’s Interior. The incident was blamed on a design flaw that was compounded when the dam was repeatedly raised.Ugo Lapointe, Canada program co-ordinator with watchdog group MiningWatch Canada, said the report confirms that the province has relied too much on self-regulation by industry.“Miniscule sanctions, pitiful fines and lack of timely legal prosecution all lead to a laissez-faire attitude and do not act as a real deterrent for dam owners,” he said. “If dam owners don’t fear the consequences of messing up and not complying with the law, why would they go all the way to do the right thing?”The province has recorded an average of three structural dam failures each year over the past five years. In 2010, the Testalinden Dam failed, destroying or damaging five homes and blocking Highway 97 with debris.Dam safety questions were raised again last year after an uncontrolled release of water through the spillway of the Cleveland dam swept away several people who were fishing downstream in the Capilano River canyon. Two people died, and human error was blamed for the incident.In its response to the report, the ministry conceded that changes were needed, and promised to review its dam safety measures to strengthen accountability mechanisms. In a statement, the ministry said it will hire five additional dam safety staff in response to the Auditor-General’s recommendations.We have a weekly Western Canada newsletter written by our B.C. and Alberta bureau chiefs, providing a comprehensive package of the news you need to know about the region and its place in the issues facing Canada.

(KGO) -- A dam just west of Yosemite is holding steady. Earlier this afternoon, authorities warned it's likely it would fail. It did cause flooding in Tuolumne County.Risk of imminent failure of the Moccasin Dam has been reduced, but potential failure still exists. Flash flood warning remains in effect. Officials continue to monitor the situation closely. #CAwx pic.twitter.com/LD5JMfxjKk— NWS Sacramento (@NWSSacramento) March 23, 2018On Thursday afternoon, the California Fish and Wildlife Trout hatchery flooded in Tuolumne County. Workers there were evacuated. The water came rushing down from the Moccasin Reservoir Dam. The sheriff's department went into emergency mode because water authorities advised the dam would likely fail after heavy rain saturated the area. State Route 49 remains closed at State Route 120 because floodwaters washed out part of the road.Doctor Sukhmander Singh teaches Civil Engineering at Santa Clara University. He says this particular dam was built in 1930 and point out the majority of California's dams were built before 1970 and were made of compacted earth.But Singh says many of the construction records for the older dams don't exist so it's unknown how well the dirt was compacted."Sustained rainfall for long period bring runoff that means there's a possibility it may overflow, spillway may be overtaxed, overworked," explained Singh.The dam is stable for now.The San Francisco Public Utilities Commission is monitoring the situation and says the spillway is damaged.Everything will be inspected. The flood waters were contained by the Don Pedro Reservoir, a mile downstream.The reservoir is part of the Hetch Hetchy water system that provides millions of gallons of water to San Francisco, the Peninsula, and Santa Clara.

Many people now know that Smokey the Bear was only partially right about forest fires. Humans should avoid carelessly starting fires, but periodic fires are natural, inevitable, and often beneficial. Over a century of fire suppression in the western United States has led to unchecked vegetation growth that has fueled catastrophic and harmful fires. Frequent, low intensity fires, on the other hand, reduce understory brush fuels and nourish forest soils.Floods and flood control are very similar. Human efforts to “control” floods have mostly eliminated small to moderate flood events while potentially worsen the damage from the largest floods. Seasonally inundated floodplains provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife, but levees and dams in California’s Central Valley have all but eliminated these beneficial small to moderate floods, driving several species to the brink of extinction. While levees and dams have succeeded in eliminating beneficial flood events, they are vulnerable to catastrophic failure during the largest of floods.Levees, dams, and national flood polices have lured people into harm’s way. By controlling and eliminating the smaller floods that once spread out across floodplains in wetlands during annual to decadal floods, they have created the false impression that floodplains are suitable places to build new subdivisions, schools, and other public infrastructure. When large floods inevitably overwhelm the capacity of the flood system, levees break and catastrophically flood communities. We all witnessed this when Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans. Catastrophic levee breaches similarly devastated some Central Valley communities in 1955, 1986, and 1997.Map indicating the failed spillway’s location compared to Oroville Dam.California’s Central Valley flood “control” will be put to the test over the next few weeks as reservoirs fill and rains continue to fall on saturated soils. We are already beginning to see some alarming signs that the system may not hold up. On Tuesday, the California Department of Water Resources reported that the spillway at Oroville Dam, the tallest earthen dam in the US at 770 feet high, was failing. Authorities and experts claim there is no risk of dam failure, and I hope they are right. An emergency spillway immediately to the north of the existing spillway should be able to accommodate the overflow, but it has never been used in the half century since the dam was built and entails sending a large volume of water down an unarmored hill side.The problem with the Oroville Dam spillway is probably just the first sign that the Central Valley flood system will require hundreds of millions of dollars in repairs after the 2017 runoff season is complete. Even if the rains let up soon, months of high runoff will create major wear and tear on the state’s levee system. After the high water years of 2005 and 2006, the state and federal government spent hundreds of millions of dollars repairing levees, often times by dumping rock along river banks and in wetlands. These “repairs” however, were little more than expensive and environmentally harmful band aids. We need to do better to protect people, property, and the environment.A crane works to repair a broken levee.As an added layer, climate change will bring larger floods in the future, particularly to the San Joaquin Valley. We need a more resilient flood management system that can accommodate large floods and rebound naturally without large amounts of human investment or environmental disruption. Levees and dams are the opposite of resilient – they work until they fail. And when they do fail the consequences can be catastrophic – leading us to do harmful and expensive “repairs” to our rivers, further perpetuating the cycle of vulnerability and destruction.Giving our rivers more room to safely accommodate large floods is the best way to protect our communities from flooding. Giving rivers more room also provides multiple other benefits including clean water, groundwater recharge, open space for recreation, and wetlands that cleanse water for fish, wildlife, and people. The draft 2017 Update to the Central Valley Flood Protection Plan emphasizes the importance of multi-benefit flood management projects and prioritizes floodway expansions near urban areas on the lower Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers. American Rivers and our partners are now designing several of these multi-benefit projects to give Central Valley rivers more room.

If I remember right, it was in the late 80’s and a beekeeper friend lost a couple thousand hives when a dam had an emergency release of water because heavy rains had filled the dam to capacity flooding the Stanislaus River and inundating his bee yard. It happened so fast that they didn’t have time to move the hives and most were washed downstream and the rest were dead and filled with mud. We saw similar scenarios in our 40 years of commercial beekeeping and I remember well one Winter, where by the first of January, Mariposa had already received 50 inches of rain where their yearly rainfall average is 25! I have seen the levees in the Valley as well and they are ‘mined’ by gophers or rock chucks that weaken them to the point of scary!ReplyLeave a Reply Cancel replyYour email address will not be published.

Mount Polley mine owner sues engineering firms over tailings dam failure | CTV News Home FOLLOW ON Advertisement BUSINESS Mount Polley mine owner sues engineering firms over tailings dam failure Laura Kane The Canadian Press Published Friday, July 8, 2016 9:09PM EDT Last Updated Friday, July 8, 2016 10:09PM EDT The tailings pond of the Mount Polley mine, southeast of Quesnel, B.C., was breached, discharging waste water into Hazeltine Creek on Monday, Aug. 4, 2014. (Provided / Cariboo Regional District) Share: Reddit Share Text: VANCOUVER -- The owner of the Mount Polley mine in British Columbia's Interior has sued two engineering firms for damages over a disastrous dam collapse two years ago. Imperial Metals (TSX:III) has filed a lawsuit in B.C. Supreme Court alleging negligence and breach of contract by Knight Piesold and AMEC, now Amec Foster Wheeler. None of the allegations has been proven in court and neither company has filed a statement of defence. The lawsuit alleges a flawed tailings storage facility was designed and monitored by Knight Piesold from the late 1980s to 2011, and then by AMEC until its collapse in August 2014. "Each of the defendants failed to undertake necessary, proper and reasonable investigation of the subsurface conditions underlying the (tailings storage facility) prior to and during its phased construction and operation," the suit says. As a result, the suit alleges, the facility had an inadequate safety standard, despite both companies repeatedly providing Imperial Metals with reports that claimed it was safe. "Those reports were in error," the suit contends. "The conduct of each of the defendants was negligent, was in breach of the applicable contracts and caused the ultimate failure of the (facility)." The dam failed on Aug. 4, 2014, spilling 24 million cubic metres of waste and water into nearby lakes and rivers and forcing the gold and copper mine to close until recently. A spokeswoman for Amec Foster Wheeler said the company could not comment on a matter that is before the courts. "We continue to work with industry partners, professional organizations and regulators to ensure that the future of British Columbia mining prioritizes safety, accountability, and environmental responsibility," said Lauren Gallagher in an email. Knight Piesold did not immediately respond to a request for comment. B.C.'s mines minister said last month that senior staff had authorized the mine to go back into full production, one year after it was approved for restricted operations. In January 2015, an independent engineering panel appointed by the B.C. government concluded the dam failed because the strength and location of a layer of clay under the dam wasn't taken into account during the design process. The lawsuit was also launched on behalf of the Mount Polley Mining Corp., of which Imperial Metals is the parent company. The company doesn't specify the amount of damages sought, but alleges it continues to incur losses as a result of the dam failure, including lost profits, the costs of laying off employees and reduced share values. The lawsuit says the province has already found the Mount Polley Mining Corp. liable to pay 3.2 million to cover the costs of the engineering panel and spill clean-up, and wants compensation from the two companies. Another independent investigation into the disaster, led by the B.C. Conservation Officer Service, is still ongoing. The RCMP and federal Department of Fisheries and Oceans are also part of the investigation.

Partners Macquarie University provides funding as a member of The Conversation AU. View all partners BHP chairman Jac Nasser says this year will be one of BHP’s most difficult. Richard Wainwright/AAP Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger It is now two weeks since the Samarco tailings dam failure in Brazil and speculation is rife as to the resultant costs and liabilities. Indeed, although the Mayor of Mariana declared a state of emergency for the city immediately after the accident, an expanded state of emergency has only this week been announced. Dam tailings have spread over 440 kilometres, triggering a deluge of economic, social and environmental problems. BHP Billiton and Vale, co-owners of the Samarco joint venture, and their shareholders are now looking for answers. In Australia commentators differ on the mining giant’s response to the disaster. The Australian Financial Review proclaims “BHP has done the right thing in Brazil” while The Age asserts “Brazil mine disaster exposes BHP’s failures”. Environmental costs Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff has described the dam failure as one of the world’s biggest environmental disasters. Putting a cost on it is not easy, however, with the trail of destruction spreading as far as the Atlantic Ocean. Brazil’s environmental agency, the Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (IBAMA), has already fined the joint venture R250 million (A92 million). A lawyer representing a community association in another state has filed a case demanding 10 billion reais (A3.69 billion) in compensation for environmental damages. Deutsche Bank estimates clean-up costs could exceed US1 billion (A1.4 billion). But differences between the parties are great as Samarco has so far only pledged to pay US260 million (A365 million) in damages as a “preliminary commitment” toward clean-up and compensation. Notwithstanding assertions the spilt material is non-toxic, Samarco has appointed independent contractors to test soil and water samples from the affected regions. IBAMA is undertaking a similar process. Yet even before these results are known some experts are suggesting it will take the environment more than 50 years to recover. Activists want a more thorough response from BHP. Richard Wainwright/AAP Social costs Corporate and industry reputations are big losers. It is estimated the disaster has affected 15 million people. The deaths of 11 workers and community members when the dam burst is the first and foremost cost of concern. Samarco, Vale and BHP have policies where worker and community safety is espoused as the number one value. Their policy lies broken. The loss of 600 properties and destruction of water supplies to more than 260,000 people in the downstream communities could lead to devastation of livelihoods and disease. The costs to address these for the more than 200 communities affected could be great. The disaster has destroyed crops and killed fish, turtles and other animals important to community survival. Activists are accusing the companies of “token sympathies” and have suggested they pay billions of dollars in compensation. The only unknown is where and when possible class actions will appear to claim these billions – Brazil, Australia, or both. BHP has the Ok Tedi experience under its belt and could be better prepared this time for what is to come, but with Vale on board Samarco will officially have responsibilities in Brazil. BHP will be unable to walk away from these and has an opportunity to adopt a business case this time that looks after the vulnerable affected parties. Greenpeace is actively involved in gathering data and monitoring the situation, while the Krenark Indian tribe has blocked iron ore shipments along a key rail line owned by Samarco hundreds of kilometres downstream. BHP CEO Andrew Mackenzie has committed his company to supporting the regions affected. He has said BHP will continue to “play our part in helping Samarco reconstruct homes, community and spirit”. An external investigation will be conducted, with the results released to the public. For the people of Brazil, actions will speak louder than words. Economic costs BHP chairman Jac Nasser told shareholders at this week’s BHP Billiton AGM: “This year will go down as one of the most difficult in [BHP’s] 130 years.” Not only is BHP facing vastly reduced commodity prices, since the disaster investors have heavily sold down BHP shares to the level of ten years ago. Dividends are of major concern for shareholders. BHP has maintained a progressive dividend policy, but this may not be able to be sustained. It seems clear volatility in the industry will increase over the years ahead. Part of shareholder concern is the direct cost of rebuilding. BHP has committed A363 million for this purpose and does not plan to abandon its investment. The costs associated with sustainability of operations are potentially enormous. It could be argued preventative costs incurred in advance, such as more securely engineered dam sites and warning mechanisms for downstream communities, would have been much lower.

after dam failure say restoration the only option Michigan Radio | By Steve Carmody Published June 15, 2020 at 7:35 AM EDT Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Email Listen • 3:21 steve carmody / Michigan Radio In the weeks since the Edenville Dam failed, and flooded Midland, the focus has been on why it failed.But the people who live upstream from the dam also want to know when, or if, they’ll get their lake back.  On a stormy morning last week, Robert Beltz stands on the green manicured lawn behind his beautiful two story home on Wixom Lake. The lawn extends to what used to be the water line.“If you walk down toward the sea wall, and look down here, it looks like a desert,” Beltz said.When the Edenville Dam failed on May 19, water rushed through the breach, draining much of Wixom Lake.  The lake is really a reservoir created in the 1920’s after a hydro-electric dam was built at the confluence of the Tittabawassee and Tobacco Rivers. It would take years to restore Wixom Lake.Last week, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer hedged when asked about rebuilding the dam.“I’m inclined to say ‘yes’ but I think there is a lot more information that I need to have to give you the absolute certainty of what next steps look like. But the end goal is, of course, is to restore this community as well as we can to the greatness it was prior to this event,” Whitmer told reporters. Credit steve carmody / Michigan Radio / Michigan Radio A spokesman for the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy says an  investigation into the dam failure will determine “where we go with next steps in relation to whether or not to rebuild.”Another option is to allow the rivers to return to their pre-1920 paths.“There’s really no better way to bring a river back to life than removing a dam,” says Brian Graber, the senior director of river restoration for American Rivers, whose mission is to restore damaged rivers.Graber says dams should be evaluated for public safety and ecological issues, as well as economic and recreational benefits.“Rivers are volatile. And with climate change they are even more volatile,” Graber said. “We really need to give rivers the space so that they can flood safely without expecting the infrastructure is going to stop that flooding.”The Edenville Dam long ago went from producing electric power to powering Gladwin County’s economy.Scott Govitz is the associate vice president of workforce and economic development at Mid-Michigan College. Govitz says tourism dollars and homes on the lake make up a significant part of the county’s sales and property tax base.“We have a county that is so reliant upon tourism and these lakes and streams...that are jewels...that we must repair this and get back on our feet,” Govitz said. “The worst case scenario could be bankruptcies of magnitudes that we haven’t seen before.”County officials are still assessing the economic impact of the dam failure and resulting flood. They are very concerned about the long-term hit of not having Wixom Lake.At this point, it’s unclear how much it would cost to repair or replace the broken dam or who would pay. For Wixom Lake homeowners like Robert Beltz, the suggestion that the dam might not get rebuilt is unthinkable.“You’d see 10,000 people around this lake, they’d all be out with pitchforks and torches,” Beltz said. “None of them want to see the lake to disappear and I do not see that as an option.”But the new view of Wixom Lake this summer will likely be the same for many years to come, nice homes overlooking mud flats with water trickling through a broken dam.

Engineers have assessed the dam and the flood impact is now expected to be minimal.(Supplied: Southern Downs Regional Council)It said water levels in the dam had dropped by approximately half a metre in the three hours since daylight Saturday.The council said engineers found the water was discharging in a controlled rate."There is a large paddock below the dam wall in which the water will first impact and this will allow for a broader dispersal should the dam wall fully fail," the council statement said.The council said residents that might be affected had been directly notified and evacuated. The red polygon shows the area likely to be flooded if the dam wall fails.(Supplied: QFES)'No actual threat'Rebecca Bolzan told the ABC that her father Joe Bolzan, the owner of the dam, had spotted the hole about 5:00pm on Friday and alerted authorities.She said the dam was not linked to the quarry but was on the family farm, where they run cattle and grow crops.Space to play or pause, M to mute, left and right arrows to seek, up and down arrows for volume.WatchDuration: 15 seconds15s The dam on the Bolzan family property has a hole in it that could cause the whole dam to break."It was quite a big hole but [the water] is actually gradually going out, which the engineers are so happy about," Ms Bolzan said."It doesn't look like [the dam wall] will let go — the water is coming out slowly and gradually, which is good. "It's not at that high-risk impact — there's no actual threat of it bursting out like they were thinking."LoadingJohn Cowley's property backs onto the dam and he said he was alerted about its potential failure by text message last night."It's always a bit scary getting a message like that in the middle of the night, particularly for families that would have been in firing line," he said."But we're on high ground so we didn't have to worry too much about it."Mr Cowley said his property was not impacted by any water."We just found out this morning that the dam does have a major problem, but I think the worst of it has probably passed now in terms of the wall collapsing and the big volume of water going downstream," he said."It is pretty unbelievable really — it is probably the extended dry period that has caused the problem with the dam for the wall to dry out so much." Mr Cowley says his property was not impacted by any water.(ABC News: Curtis Rodda)Evacuees can't go home yetSouthern Downs Councillor Cameron Gow said engineers were working on a solution."The hole in the wall is not huge — it's measured by only a few metres," he said."Compared to the size of the storage, which is 430 megalitres, it's not coming out at a rapid rate of knots."Earlier Saturday an evacuation centre was opened at Warwick Christian College, but at 8:00am the council said the centre had been closed and evacuees should seek shelter with family and friends.Cr Gow said while the situation had "certainly stabilised" and there was no immediate danger, authorities were taking a cautious approach."We won't be allowing evacuees back in until they've advised us the situation is safe," he said."If a decision is made for them not to return this evening, they may stay with family and friends, but we're actually looking to get people back to their homes — if this situation resolves itself — sooner rather than later."Cr Gow also praised the dam's owner for noticing the hole and alerting emergency services immediately."He advised emergency services and Queensland police straight away and our engineers, the independent engineers, we've all been working with the private landholder and he's been really good," he said. Police set up an exclusion zone on Saturday about 2 kilometres from the property.(ABC News: Peter Gunders)Posted 14 Feb 202014 Feb 2020Fri 14 Feb 2020 at 7:00pm, updated 15 Feb 202015 Feb 2020Sat 15 Feb 2020 at 8:04pmShareCopy linkFacebookTwitterArticle share optionsShare this onFacebookTwitterLinkedInSend this byEmailMessengerCopy linkWhatsAppRelated StoriesBOM issues flash flooding warning for Sunshine Coast after 'intense rainfall'Rain to ease, but flood watch continues on a steamy Valentine's DayMan's body pulled from river, as storms lash South East QueenslandMore on:AustraliaBrisbaneDisasters and AccidentsEmergency IncidentsEmergency PlanningFloodsQLDToowoombaWarwickWeatherABC EmergencySearch any location in Australia to find nearby active incidentsFind an incidentStay up-to-dateStay up-to-date with local coverage on ABC Radio, the emergency broadcasterABC Radio FinderPlan for an emergencyPlan for a StormPlan for a FloodTop StoriesCommonwealth Bank hikes fixed mortgage rates by 1.4 per centGuy Sebastian's former manager found guilty of embezzling part of singer's earnings'Who's gonna pay?': Beekeepers 'lose everything' as hives go up in flamesSouth Australia records first monkeypox case in man who returns from overseasCricket grandstand collapses during Sri Lanka-Australia testNSW teachers walk off job for historic joint strike over 'insulting' pay offerR Kelly abused his victims for decades.

Jan Morrill January 25, 2022 Close to four hundred municipalities in the central Brazilian state of Minas Gerais declared a state of emergency after unusually heavy rains hit the region in early January. Widespread flooding submerged houses, blocked roads, and led to dozens of deaths and hundreds of thousands of evacuations. While extreme flooding is devastating under any circumstances, many communities in the region face another even more threatening situation: potentially unstable mine waste storage facilities that could collapse at any moment. The 2015 collapse of a tailings dam in Minas Gerais’ Mariana district killed 19 people and left hundreds homeless. Current flooding in the region raises the risk of similar collapses. Photo by Felipe Werneck/Ibama. While mining companies are quick to blame heavy rainfall for the problems with their tailings dams, dam instability is the result of years of decisions that prioritize profits over safety. Safer, more resilient tailings dams are more expensive to build and maintain. Mining companies have chosen cheaper options, like upstream dams, for tailings disposal. As climate change brings increasingly severe and extreme weather conditions, tailings dams designed and constructed to maximize profits will put more and more downstream communities at risk. Brazil’s iron ore mines store their waste in earthen dams, called tailings dams, built from mine waste materials. Tailings dams, especially those constructed using upstream raises, are particularly prone to collapse if the tailings become saturated and the water level behind the dam rises. Before the rains started, the National Mining Agency (ANM in Portuguese) had already classified 36 dams in Minas Gerais (of the 40 nationwide) as being potentially at risk of failure. Three of those dams are at “imminent risk of collapse,” posing a terrifying threat to downstream communities. Additionally with the recent rains, the Brazilian government specifically questioned the drainage systems and signs of erosion on 18 dams owned by Brazilian mining giant Vale as signs of potential failure. The Public Ministry’s office gave Vale 10 days to provide a report on what actions the company plans to take to ensure these dams do not collapse. On Saturday January 8th, a waste pile collapsed at French steel pipe producer Vallourec’s Pau Branco iron ore mine. Mine waste flowed into a water retention dam on site, which caused the dam to overflow. Here are stunning videos of the event and the aftermath. The waste pile was a co-disposal stack of waste rock and tailings, and was registered as a tailings dam with the ANM. The overflow flooded a major highway, sweeping away cars and leading to a two-day road closure. It also forced the evacuation of a staff member and 400 animals that the Wild Animal Rehabilitation Center located below the mine. According to the Observatório de Mineração, “the team responsible for the evacuation, around 60 people in 21 vehicles, faced the risks associated with going into an emergency area with the threat of [dam] break detected by the National Mining Agency.” Brazilian regulators fined the company 51.6M USD for the spill and suspended operations at the mine. This disaster did not come as a surprise to community organizations and local officials who had raised concerns about the stability of the waste disposal stack in 2021. Their warnings were ignored by the company and Brazilian regulators. On January 11th, a dam at the Mar Azul mine, one of the three dams classified as at imminent risk of collapse, reportedly broke and sent tailings into downstream water bodies. Vale, the mining company that owns the three high-risk dams, released a statement saying the dam’s structural integrity had not been compromised and the runoff was caused by mudslides on the face of the structure. The downstream community has expressed fear that the entire dam will collapse. They have also been stranded by flooding. Recently, Vale built a 10 story retention wall to mitigate a potential tailings dam failure. The wall has caused rain waters to back up into the downstream community of Macacos. Fifty-eight families were evacuated and another 12 were stranded by floodwaters. The community of Macacos isn’t alone in fearing a dam collapse. Dozens of communities across Minas Gerais are facing similar circumstances. The town of Congonhas is worried about the possible collapse of the CSN Casa de Pedra dam as water builds up behind the structure. An independent review of the dam identified possible stability issues in 2019 and with the recent flooding the ANM has raised its emergency classification to “not-controlled.” The current disaster is unfolding in Brazil, but there have been at least seven tailings dam spills and failures in the last two months across the world. Governments must implement strong tailings regulations guided by public safety, like those outlined in Safety First: Guidelines for Responsible Mine Tailings Management. The Movement of People Affected by Dams is asking for international solidarity to donate to humanitarian aid efforts for the thousands of people still living in emergency situations caused by the flooding and the unstable tailings dams.

While flows into the Upper Madison are back to their previous levels, there isn’t a good understanding of the impacts.“There was some mortality observed, although it could have been much worse” Morgan Jacobson from Montana Fish Wildlife and Parks explained. “We are glad that it wasn’t worse than it was,” he said regarding the fish stranded on the banks after flow was cut off. Biologists and volunteers ventured out to salvage fish on the river that were left in shallow pools and side channels on Wednesday.When the dam failure was first discovered on Tuesday, FWP had concerns about asking people to go out to salvage fish. The first concern was public safety. If the water was restored to the river, volunteers could get trapped or drown in the quickly rising water. The other concern was the exposed spawning areas for rainbow trout and other fish called redds. “A redd is a place where fish lay their eggs and it is there until they hatch” Jacobson explained. “When we see water levels drop, some of those redds become exposed to the air and the cold temperatures” he continued.Jacobson explained that the redds could be viable even out of water for a short time. Cold temperatures and exposure could damage the viability of those eggs. Getting water restored to the river is key to the survival of those redds and Northwestern Energy was working around the clock to fix the damaged dam which was restored early Thursday. Even with water restored to the river, there are no answers to the damage that was done. “Whether those redds remain viable, and how that recruitment looks will take more than a year to learn what that looks like” Jacobson said.From an angler’s or outfitter’s standpoint, the restoration of the river flow was a relief, but still a concern on the fishery. Dan Lohmiller who is an owner and guide of River Edge Fly shop in Bozeman, says that most anglers may not even realize if the damage is done initially. “If the actual eggs were affected, you know, in the short term you might not notice it” he said. “But in the long term you might lose a whole age class of fish” he continued.Brown trout populations in the upper stretch of the Madison River have been a concern for a few years. Declining numbers of brown trout are noticeable to anglers, and without a good definitive explanation as to why. “It seems to be a long-term trend on the recruitment of brown trout,” Lohmiller said of the Upper Madison River. “I'm not sure that anybody knows exactly why, but obviously this isn't going to help that situation in the Madison” he explained.Closures on the Madison River were lifted Friday morning, but nobody that regularly fishes the river is acting as nothing happened. Several guides and anglers were amazed that the river was going to open up so quickly after such a potentially devastating event on the fishery. The fact remains that the closure of the river regularly depends on water temperatures and flow levels on the river. With the flow back to pre-failure levels, the river can open to anglers once again. Copyright 2021 Scripps Media, Inc. All rights reserved.

The little bulging of the dam wall sensors did pick up was not enough over the prior 12 months to trigger an alarm. "None of the monitoring devices detected precursors to failure. Rather, the dam's failure was sudden and abrupt, which was the result of high shear stresses in the downstream slope of the dam and the brittle, undrained response of the tailings," the report said. The design and construction of the failed dam were major factors contributing to a "dam that was steep with a lack of sufficient drainage, resulting in high water levels, both of which caused high structural stresses within the dam". No seismic activity was recorded in the area that day. This resulted in a significant portion of the tailings remaining saturated, which is "a prerequisite for undrained flow liquefaction", the report said. Vale's environmental track record has been under the microscope for some time. It and Australian partner BHP were responsible for the 2015 Mariana dam disaster that killed 19 people. It had earlier raised the alarm that four more dams were at risk of collapse, and in May triggered the evacuation of downstream communities at its Gongo Soco mine after a slippage in that dam structure. The Brumadinho disaster resulted in the axing of former CEO Fabio Schvartsman and three other senior executives and triggered intense legal and regulatory scrutiny. Vale, one of the world's most important iron ore producers, had been tempering its production guidance throughout the year, falling from an initial 2019 forecast of 400Mt to just 307-312Mt predicted last month.

AP Photo | John L. Russell TRAVERSE CITY, MI — Emergency management officials have so far fielded 53 damage claims from Grand Traverse County residents affected by this month's dam collapse flooding on the Boardman River, the Traverse City Record-Eagle reported.On Saturday, Oct. 6, a temporary "dewatering structure" draining the Brown Bridge Pond in East Bay Township apparently failed, sending water rushing downstream from the Brown Bridge Dam, which is being removed amid a large-scale river restoration project.The 28-mile-long Boardman River flows into Lake Michigan at Traverse City. The Brown Bridge Dam is the first among three to be removed to return the river to its natural flow.The structure was supposed to gradually release water from Brown Bridge pond over the course of two weeks, but the pond emptied in four to five hours, flooding out some residents and causing evacuations downstream of the dam.State officials said this week it could take months to determine an exact cause of the dam failure. The Record-Eagle reported that the river rose as much as five feet in some places during the flooding.Grand Traverse County health officials said water from flooded wells is unsafe unless boiled properly.Note to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission.DisclaimerRegistration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement, Privacy Policy and Cookie Statement, and Your California Privacy Rights (User Agreement updated 1/1/21.

The average age of a U.S. dam is 56 years, according to the American Society of Civil Engineers, and the total cost to address needed repairs is more than 70 billion, according to the Association of State Dam Safety Officials. But because 64 percent of U.S. dams are privately-owned but provide public benefits such as flood control, stable lake levels and recreational value at the reservoirs they impound, arguments often erupt over who should pay for repairs. Too often, experts say, the answer is no one. “These discussions have been going on for years and years with no good answer,” said Mark Ogden, a technical specialist with the Association of State Dam Safety Officials focused on state safety programs.In Michigan, two-thirds of dams have outlived their intended 50-year lifespan. But removing or fixing aging dams is expensive. Attorneys for the owners of the Edenville Dam estimated it would have cost up to 10 million to complete repairs demanded by the federal government to ensure the dam could withstand major floods. That’s more than double the total amount the dam’s owner, Boyce Hydro Power LLC, paid to buy the Edenville and Sanford dams and two others nearby in 2006. Those upstream dams, Smallwood and Secord, were damaged during last week’s rains. The high price of repairs often leads to “a big game of chicken,” over who should pick up the tab, said Jay Lund, director of the Center for Watershed Sciences at the University of California, Davis and a member of the National Academy of Engineering. “Everyone would like to point out the problem,” Lund said, “but point to someone else for the solution.”‘Should have come down harder’In the aftermath of the disaster, the finger-pointing has begun. Starting in 1993, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission warned the Edenville dam fell short of federal safety standards and demanded owners increase spillways to withstand the “probable maximum flood” — or the worst flood that could be expected in the area surrounding the dam.  Edenville, FERC regulators concluded, could only handle about half that much water. Lund, the Center for Watershed Sciences director, said that is an exceptionally low grade for a federally regulated dam, and should have been “a big red flag,” that prompted quick action to remedy the problem.

Gretchen Whitmer launches investigation into Midland dam failures​Related: Mid-Michigan dam that failed was cited for years for safety violationsRelated: Michigan regulators moved fast on dangerous dam. To protect mussels.Related: Michigan GOP calls for Nessel to step down from investigation into dam failureAfter 25 years of warnings and citations, federal regulators revoked the dam’s license to generate hydropower in late 2018. “Regulators probably should have come down on them harder,” Lund said.A spokesperson for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission wouldn’t say why it didn’t move faster. “FERC provided its position in the Sept. 2018 revocation order,” Celeste Miller wrote in an emailed response to a series of detailed questions from Bridge. The license revocation shifted oversight to Michigan regulators, who never ordered any improvements even though they suspected the dam couldn’t even meet state standards, which the Federal Emergency Management Agency deems among the least stringent in the nation.Michigan environmental officials, who are now investigating the dam’s failure despite questions of conflicts-of-interest, say they were beleaguered by inadequate staffing and a challenging handoff from federal regulators.FERC inspection records on the dams were sealed when Michigan took control, said Hugh McDiarmid, a spokesperson for the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy.He said staffers were “starting from ground zero.”“With one of the largest dams under their jurisdiction and an uncooperative owner, combined with the other 1,100-plus dams under their jurisdiction, I think our three-person dam staff moved reasonably aggressively,” McDiarmid said.Eighteen months after assuming oversight, Michigan regulators were still researching whether the dam met Michigan safety standards when the flood occurred. Jennifer Amerkhail, who worked as an attorney with FERC for 16 years and now works at Jenner & Block law firm in Washington, D.C., said federal regulators only rarely revoke dam’s licenses, perhaps once every few years.Getting to that final stage of revocation can take a long time because FERC must give the dam owner due process and ensure “the licensee has the opportunity to make things right.” One revocation case she worked on took about a decade to finalize.“FERC is trying to balance everything and public safety is one of the major concerns, they take that very seriously,” Amerkhail said, adding that in the Edenville case, FERC was particularly active, which reflects that concern. “When you have a limited ability to do certain things, you can look at your playbook and you only have a few plays that you can make,” she said.Thinner profits, costlier repairsBecause hydropower dam operators depend on federal licenses to sell power, most will comply with FERC directives, said Anne Jefferson, a geology professor and hydrologist at Kent State University. But the economics of dam ownership have shifted over time, and many once-lucrative hydropower dams are now marginally profitable at best, said Lund of the University of California. Meanwhile, dams built to the laxer safety standards of a bygone era need significant investment to comply with modern standards.Many dam owners, Lund said, would go bankrupt if forced to pay for needed repairs. So rather than pursue court action or other punitive measures, regulators often opt to work with dam owners to gradually address maintenance or repair backlogs, resorting to punishment only in extreme circumstances. Boyce Hydro, the Midland-area dams owner, argued in court that it couldn’t pay for repairs because prices for hydro power have fallen. The company argued that, by revoking its license, federal regulators eliminated revenues that could have paid for repairs.Sen. Jim Stamas, R-Midland, said the deck is stacked against dam owners who need to make regulatory improvements because the state Public Service Commission — which assigns the rates at which power generators are compensated — sets rates too low for companies to make adequate repairs. “There was no way in Michigan to recover that cost [of improvements,] which gets back to why it takes way too long for many of these facilities to upgrade their systems,” Stamas said.The Edenville dam generated about 1 million in annual revenue, according to court papers, while three smaller ones nearby owned by Boyce generated another 900,000. Expenses were 1.2 million or less, records show.Many neighbors who live near the dams are dubious that Boyce, which is owned by the trust of deceased publishing mogul William D. Boyce, couldn’t afford the repairs.  Multiple class-action lawsuits have been filed against Boyce and the state to recoup damages for area residents harmed by the floods.Solutions elusiveIn some states, governments can step in and make repairs to dams if owners won’t. Michigan has no dedicated fund for such repairs, McDiarmid said.The problem of deferred dam maintenance is not confined to Michigan. California is widely considered a national leader in dam safety, with dozens of employees and a budget of 20 million dedicated to the cause. Yet when the state’s Oroville Dam failed in 2017, independent investigators came to a disturbing conclusion: The failure was the result of a “long-term systemic failure” on the part of both regulators and industry.That conclusion “certainly raises concerns about how good of a job we’re doing in California as well as other states that struggle to have adequate budgets and staff to do their job,” said Martin McCann, who runs the National Performance of Dams Program at Stanford University.In Michigan, consensus to address the issue has been elusive.Mark Coscarelli, a senior policy fellow at Lansing-based Public Sector Consultants, led a 2007 project to develop recommendations for Michigan policymakers to address the state’s massive collection of aging dams. In many cases, the report’s authors found, useless dams could be removed for less money than it would take to shore them up for safety. Removal also eliminates the environmental and safety hazards dams may pose.In places like mid-Michigan, where Boyce’s dams originally constructed for electricity generation are now prized for the recreational and scenic value of their reservoirs, the report’s authors determined the public should help pay for upkeep.“There needs to be more public-private partnership when you have members of the public deriving some benefit from these privately-owned structures,” Coscarelli told Bridge.But much like Michigan’s struggle to fund road maintenance, bridge repair and other infrastructure needs, Coscarelli said, “nobody wants new taxes.” And there is a general perception that societal concerns deemed more immediate -- education and health care, for instance -- are more deserving of public money. Until, that is, disaster happens. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has ordered state officials to investigate the cause of the dam’s failure and recommend policy, legislative, budgetary and enforcement solutions to prevent repeat disasters in the future.Coscarelli has been here before, and he isn’t holding his breath for a solution that sticks. “Six months will pass and we’ll be on to the next emergency of the day,” he said. “People will lose sight of it and go on with their lives, the impoundment will come back up and we’ll live happily ever after until the next dam blows out.

The independent team, charged by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, observed that the transition from private ownership to public ownership was a solution to the underfunding of repairs and capacity work on the Edenville Dam. The task force brought together hydrologists, agencies of regulatory oversight and other experts who are working to digest the independent committee's findings. The Four Lakes Task Force has issued a statement to the community and will thoroughly respond to the state and federal departments of oversight. "While we have not completed a comprehensive review of the Independent Forensic Team’s (IFT) Final Report in connection with the failures of Edenville and Sanford dams, we wanted to provide the community with a summary of our initial review of the report," said Stacey Trapani in an emailed statement on May 12. "The experts created a report with over 500 pages of analysis and data. This document is a summary and we will share a more robust analysis later." Task force President Dave Kepler said the organization will develop an analysis for the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy (EGLE) and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) in a couple of weeks. In the meantime, the task force officials are asking residents with questions to email info@fourlakestaskforce.org. On flood study and spillways Four Lakes Task Force did not agree with Boyce Hydro’s position that the spillway capacity met the ½ PMF (probable maximum flood) standard. During its due diligence prior to the acquisition of the dams, the task force commissioned a hydrological and hydraulic study to assess the design of the existing spillway and determine what would be needed to meet dam safety requirements. Thetask force said additional spillway capacity should have been addressed by Boyce Hydro and FERC over a decade or more before, and it was not. While the hydrological and hydraulic study commissioned by the task force was not available at the time of the dam failures, it was evident that the Edenville Dam would likely not have passed the state dam safety requirement of ½ PMF. Thus, as part of future planning, the task force anticipated the design and construction of an auxiliary spillway to meet or exceed this requirement. The construction of the auxiliary spillway could not start without permits and could not start until it obtained ownership and control of the dams. The task force never had ownership or control of the dams prior to the dam failures. On failure mechanisms The IFT is confident that water did not go over the top of the Edenville Dam. The IFT concluded that the Edenville Dam failure was caused by “static liquefaction (sudden loss of soil strength) in a section of the embankment." The report further noted that a construction defect existed when the Edenville Dam was constructed in the 1920s. The dam was constructed in a manner that significantly deviated from the design plans and construction specifications, which resulted in the embankments being constructed with sections of very loose sands. This construction defect went undetected, and the vulnerability was unrecognized for almost 100 years.

News Dragons slip past Loons in 10 innings at Dow Diamond Gate hoists The IFT report indicates that the original 1920 gate hoist systems created a physical limitation on gate opening height at Edenville. This limitation was noted in a 1996 letter from FERC. Edenville Dam was the only dam with the existing hoists where gates could not open fully in a safe manner. The IFT report identifies the safety issues with the gate hoists at the Edenville Dam and the modifications previously made by Boyce Hydro. At the time of the Edenville Dam failure, the gate hoists were not capable of raising the gates in a manner to permit additional flow, and the report concludes that had the new gate hoists proposed by the task force (during its due diligence prior to the acquisition of the dams) been installed prior to May 2020, that may have lowered the water enough to prevent the dam failure. In 2020, task force initiated the purchase of new gate hoists for installation. Lake level being lowered to winter levels or to run of the river The view of the IFT was that prior to the May 2020 event, pre-lowering the lake before the storm would have made anegligible-to-small difference in the peak lake level because the storage volume of the lake between the normal level andthe spillway crests was a small portion of the storm runoff volume. On actions taken on the day of the Edenville Dam failure The IFT report states that “numerous individuals representing Boyce Hydro, Four Lakes Task Force, Spicer, Midland County, EGLE, and others were on the site” and also states, “Boyce Hydro did not have an engineering consultant available to come to thesite or participate in discussions related to the status of the dam.” Four Lakes Task Force was at the site but was not the owner or operator. Boyce Hydro had authority but failed to have a dam engineer available to address the emergency. The task force said it should also be noted that EGLE was present and under Part 315 had emergency authority to address the situation. The task force is conducting a robust review of the report and will release an analysis of the report and how the learnings will befactored into its plans.

(Bill Husa — Mercury-Register) By Mercury News Editorial Board | Mercury NewsPUBLISHED: April 24, 2017 at 8:45 a.m. | UPDATED: April 24, 2017 at 9:24 a.m.Transparency should always be a public agency’s default position, because problems always arise when it isn’t.

It continues despite considerable public and political pressure since the spillway collapse. Two developments last week perfectly illustrate the point. One involves awarding a nine-figure bid to a company to fix the spillway without any detail about what the company is actually doing. The other involves an independent review of what went wrong, which takes on added weight because the promised review by the government is nonexistent so far. The independent analysis was released this week by Robert Bea, a founder of UC Berkeley’s Center for Catastrophic Risk Management and a nationally recognized expert, who reviewed what went wrong in high-profile disasters such as Hurricane Katrina and the BP oil spill. He blames DWR for the Oroville disaster. Bea determined the spillway collapse was “developed and propagated by DWR during the gated spillway design, construction and maintenance activities.” Bea said when he saw roughly 180,000 people downstream from the dam being forced into a “terrifying evacuation” on Feb. 12, “I was just shaking my head because it was a trauma that didn’t have to happen.” Bea set out to find out what went wrong DWR records and photos, including many from our newspapers. The short answer: Many things went wrong, both in design and building of the spillway, as well as maintenance over the ensuing years. Given the state’s track record, Bea’s report may be the best explanation we get. The federal government has ordered DWR to oversee an examination by independent dam safety experts. A DWR spokesman assures us that is being worked on and will be released to the public. There’s no timetable. Based on DWR’s performance so far, we aren’t holding our breath. We’ll hope for the best but expect the usual. We saw more of that with the bidding process for spillway repairs. DWR named the three companies that bid on the project and the amount of their bids. It then announced late Monday that the huge Fortune 500 company Kiewit was awarded the 275 million-plus contract. What exactly is Kiewit doing? We don’t know. DWR refused to release details because it “could cause a security risk if released.” The project is vaguely described by DWR as “the complete recovery or replacement of the spillway.” Note the word “or.” It could be that DWR doesn’t know what it’s doing yet because its own study isn’t complete. How can DWR design a fix if it doesn’t know what went wrong? That’s a troubling, 275 million question that DWR doesn’t want to answer for the people paying the bill. Which would be: Taxpayers.

Georgia dam failure in Toccoa Falls had a national impactNews Sports Entertainment Lifestyle Opinion USA TODAY Obituaries E-Edition Legals Subscribe Georgia dam failure in Toccoa Falls had a national impactKatelyn RileyView CommentsView CommentsOn Sunday, Nov. 6, 1977, a small embankment dam located above Toccoa Falls Bible College in Georgia failed, releasing a wall of water through a steep ravine and into the campus, killing 39 people.The historic failure, along with several other major dam failures in the 1970s, led to the establishment of the National Dam Safety Program and many state dam safety programs around the country, which work together to reduce the risk of dam failures and incidents in the U.S. The urgency of this mission continually increases as populations increase downstream of the nation’s more than 90,000 dams. On Nov.6, 1977 at approximately 1:30 a.m.., the Kelly Barnes Dam failed, sending floodwaters over 186-foot-high Toccoa Falls and onto the campus of Toccoa Falls Bible College.The steep ravine between the dam and the college funneled the water into a swift and powerful wave, about 25 feet high. Students, faculty, and staff living on the campus a short distance downstream were caught unaware as they slept. The flood caused an estimated 2.8 million worth of damage, predominantly confined to college property. The dam likely failed due to high water finding its way through irregularities and defects in the dam. The watershed above the dam had received several inches of rain over the few days leading up to the failure and up to an additional 3.5 inches on the night of the failure.The dam had not been maintained for years and was covered with trees and woody vegetation.^President Carter and the immediate impactThe Kelly Barnes failure was a catalyst for change in dam safety. Georgia natives Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter, the recently elected president and First Lady, learned of the disaster while at church. Rosalynn left directly for Toccoa Falls and was onsite as first responders removed debris and recovered bodies from the rubble. On Dec. 7, 1977, one month after the failure, President Carter directed the Secretary of the Army to immediately commence the inspection of more than 9,000 non-federal dams that posed a high potential for loss of life and property, were they to fail.Carter made 15 million available for this “Phase I” inspection program, which revealed the unsafe conditions of the vast majority of non-federal dams and ultimately led to more sound dam safety policies on both state and federal levels.These actions in the wake of the Kelly Barnes dam failure were laudable, but the tragedy might have been averted altogether had Congress followed up on legislation passed five years earlier. The 1972 National Dam Inspection Act (PL 92-367) set a path toward improved dam safety nationwide, directing the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to create an inventory of all non-federal dams meeting certain height-impoundment requirements, to inspect high-hazard-potential dams in the inventory, and to make recommendations for a comprehensive long-term program for inspecting and regulating dams nationwide.Unfortunately, Congress failed to allocate sufficient funds to carry out the inspection program or formulate a national dam safety strategy until 39 people were killed at Toccoa Falls.Jonathan Garton, current president of the Association of State Dam Safety Officials (ASDSO), said about today’s anniversary, “It is of the utmost importance that we continue to remember this tragedy so that failures of this type don’t happen again. Those in the dam safety community memorialize those lost in this tragedy, as well as other people who have lost their lives to dam failures, and are committed to reducing dam failure risks across the country.”^Dam safety todayToday, the National Inventory of Dams includes more than 90,000 dams, more than 15,000 of which are classified as high-hazard-potential structures — that is, their failure would likely cause loss of life. It is estimated that about 12 percent of these high-hazard potential dams need repair or upgrade for safety reasons. The vast majority of these dams are state-regulated, and, while state dam safety programs are in far better shape than they were 40 years ago, many challenges remain: foremost among them are lack of adequate funding for state dam safety programs, educating dam owners about their responsibility for dam safety, and lack of funding for dam maintenance and rehabilitation.As downstream populations increase, more and more dams pose potential threats to communities. ASDSO estimates that it will require almost 22 billion to upgrade or repair the most critical (high-hazard potential) federal and non-federal dams in the United States.To learn more about Dam Safety in Your State visit DamSafety.orgThe Association of State Dam Safety Officials is a national non-profit organization serving state dam safety programs and the broader dam safety community.

Improved drainage works were completed in October 2011, and the dam was declared safe to maintain its maximum reservoir level. REPORTER FILE PHOTO Study shows potential dam failure could impact more than 25,000 residents Flood district receives report that calls for upgraded emergency plans Wednesday, September 20, 2017 1:42pmNews A study commissioned by the King County Flood Control District in the wake of the emergency evacuation of communities near Northern California’s Oroville Dam in February shows the impact that a potential dam failure could have on the region. The report recommends updating emergency action plans and the development of “inundation maps” showing the potential areas that could be underwater if a dam fails or water needs to be released from the dam. “This study and its recommendations provide steps forward to strengthen our evacuation plans, coordination between jurisdictions and planning for potential flood events,” said Reagan Dunn, chair of the Flood Control District’s Board of Supervisors. “The close call at the Oroville Dam was a good opportunity to update our region’s emergency action plans and find ways to improve.” “Upwards of 22,000 people and over 4 billion in economic activity would be disrupted in the Kent Valley alone in the event of a failure at the Howard Hanson Dam,” said Dave Upthegrove, vice chair of the Flood Control District’s Board of Supervisors. “The recommendations in this study will help the county achieve a critical level of preparedness in the event of a dam failure.” The study, done in collaboration with the King County Office of Emergency Management (KCOEM), and King County Water and Land Resources Division (WLR), was presented to the Flood Control District’s Executive Committee at its Sept. 18 meeting. The report illustrates that the Emergency Action Plans (EAPs), which the state Department of Ecology requires for the 82 dams in King County, show gaps that could impact their readiness and ability to respond to a dam failure emergency. Less than a third of the EAPs have been updated in the last year, with the majority having no update in the last five years. Sixty of the EAPs either did not have, or had no current, inundation map, which would show emergency responders the areas that would be impacted by either a dam failure or the need to release water to prevent the failure of a dam. The study also stated the need to develop a countywide dam safety education program. With more than 25,000 people potentially required to evacuate in the case of a dam failure, the study calls for the development of a comprehensive program that educates municipalities and residents on the steps they would need to safely and effectively evacuate from areas at risk. Along with the creation of an education program, there is also a need to assess the capability of regional entities to shelter and care for those who must evacuate because of a dam failure. The study calls for an assessment of what may be needed versus what is available to identify any potential gaps relative to a dam failure event.

More Videos Next up in 5 Example video title will go here for this video Author: Alan Kozeluh Published: 7:37 PM CDT August 5, 2021 Updated: 7:39 PM CDT August 5, 2021 SAN ANTONIO — For the third time in five years, one of the lakes on the Guadalupe River is draining due to the failure of its dam. Now, some of the residents along Lake Gonzales are reckoning with what losing the lake could mean to them. “There’s a lot of spiritual food that I get from this river, it’s not just the fish and the wildlife. The people are fed by this river, just the soul.” Life along the Guadalupe River inspired retired teacher Jackie Sue Lanford to write the River Song. The only issue is that her particular stretch of the river, up until a few days ago, was Lake Gonzales. “Sitting down here, like we are right now, is so peaceful,” said John Cores. “And it still is. But the lake is gone. Somebody stole my lake.” Cores owns one of the properties close to the Gonzales Lake dam. He says the lake disappeared practically overnight. “It keeps going lower,” Cores said, pointing to a piece of land that became exposed as the water level went down. “That island is even more visible.” The trouble began Tuesday morning, the dam’s spill gates had been lowered to keep the lake from flooding. When the Guadalupe Blanco River Authority tried to raise them back up, one of gates didn’t respond. The GBRA opened the other gate up to try to get the water level low enough to see what needs to be repaired. It’s a decision some of the residents are questioning. “It’s just heartbreaking when you see this most beautiful of Texas’ gifts to man and you see how the GBRA has managed it,” Cores said. “This is their track record.” This is the third time a dam has failed on a Guadalupe Valley Lake in the past five years, starting with lake wood in 2016 and the collapse of the lake Dunlop dam in 2019. In a statement—the GBRA blames the dam failure on the aging spill gates that are over 90 years old and they’re still trying to figure out if they can even fix it. But in the meantime—CEO and general manager Kevin Patteson told us they would continue to work with the community to try to find funding options to make repairs or replace it all together. “We are grateful that the spill gate failure at Lake Gonzales did not result in any injuries,” said Patteson. “This is a challenging situation for everyone involved. We have worked to keep the more than 90-year old spill gates in operation for as long as we could safely do so, but we cannot prevent them from failing. In May—on the two-year anniversary of the Dunlop dam failure—construction started on the new Dunlop dam — the funding coming from taxpayers and help from the GBRA. However—the GBRA says this might be a challenge for property owners on lake Gonzales because they don’t’ have the tax base and development for such a project.

Built for 1.5 million by the Missouri River Power Company, construction began in 1905 on the first dam which was made from steel. The dam was declared operational on February 12, 1907.One issue engineers faced with construction was the riverbed at that section of the Missouri. The bedrock was covered by a thick layer of gravel, meaning it couldn’t be anchored in bedrock.Steel sheet pilings were driven 35 feet into the riverbed and the steel of the dam was attached to the pilings. Stone footing capped with concrete on the upstream side was set against the pilings in the riverbed to support the structure. A 20-foot-deep layer of volcanic ash was laid down on the upstream riverbed to discourage seeping with engineers believing the weight of the water would compact it and prevent erosion around the pillars. Montana Historical Society On April 14, 1908, at about 2:30 p.m. the dam failed after water pressure eroded away the ash and gravel by the footing of the pillars. Crews first noticed silt-heavy water gushing from the base of the dam which prompted them to evacuate the structure.About 15 minutes later, the footings gave way, causing a breach in the dam. The water pouring through the breach further damaged the dam's footing, and six minutes later a 300-foot wide section of the dam tore loose.A 20-30 foot wave swept downstream. Workers were able to notify people downstream, helping many get to safety in time. There were no officially reported deaths contributed to the dam’s failure. Damages were estimated at more than 1 million and pieces of metal that belong to the dam can still be found near the riverbanks downstream.The first Hauser Dam was one of only three steel dams in the world. As a result of the dam’s failure, even though the steel was not found to be at fault, engineers saw the first Hauser Dam as a cautionary tale and no steel dam has been built since.Missouri River Power began reconstruction of Hauser Dam in July 1908 and completed it in the spring of 1911.Now owned by NorthWestern Energy, Hauser Dam can produce 19 megawatts of power.

Failing Puerto Rico dam that endangers thousands not inspected since 2013 - The Washington Post Sections Home The Washington Post logo Democracy Dies in Darkness Subscribe Username Sign In My Post My Reading List Account Settings Newsletters & alerts Gift subscriptions Contact us Help desk My Post My Reading List Account Settings Newsletters & alerts Gift subscriptions Contact us Help desk Accessibility for screenreader Business Failing Puerto Rico dam that endangers thousands not inspected since 2013 An aerial view shows damage to the Guajataca Dam in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria, in Quebradillas, Puerto Rico. (Alvin Baez/Reuters) By Steven Mufson Steven Mufson Reporter covering the business of climate change Email Bio Follow September 26, 2017 Puerto Rico's faltering Guajataca Dam was completed when Calvin Coolidge was president. It is one of 38 dams in Puerto Rico, and according to an Army Corps of Engineers inventory, every single one of them has been rated as having a "high hazard potential." Yet Guajataca hasn't been inspected since 2013, according to the National Inventory of Dams, significantly longer than is ordinarily required of dams with high hazard potential. Now the 120-foot wall of the earthen Guajataca Dam — finished by the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA) in 1927 — has fissures that triggered evacuation orders for thousands of people who were scrambling to deal with the devastation of Hurricane Maria. Water has been pouring out of one section of the large reservoir into small neighborhoods down in the valley. [‘Thousands of people could die’: Evacuations urged as Guajataca Dam is in ‘imminent’ danger] A high hazard rating reflects the damage that could happen from a dam’s failure, and it is not a commentary on the condition of a dam. Nonetheless, one safety expert said he was surprised by the long gap between inspections at the dam. “Since this is clearly a high hazard dam (one for which loss of life is likely if the dam were to fail), it would be typical for an inspection of some type to be done once every one or two years,” John W. France, vice president for the dams and hydropower technical practice of the engineering firm AECOM, said in an email. Those inspections are carried out by the Puerto Rican government; 80 percent of dams in the United States are inspected by state governments. Local residents use a boat to pass next to flooded houses near the Guajataca Dam. (Carlos Garcia Rawlins/Reuters) Although France said he was not familiar with Guajataca, he said the four-year gap in inspections violates common practice in most of the United States. He said that “most state dam safety programs in the United States require a physical (visual) inspection of a high hazard dam on an annual basis.” Yet five of PREPA's 16 dams have not been inspected since 2013, and one has not been inspected since 2012, according to the National Inventory of Dams. The Association of State Dam Safety Officials said in a recent report that the percentage of state inspections declined steadily from 1999 to 2015, when just 80 percent of the high hazard dams were inspected. In 2015, two of Puerto Rico's dams were rated "poor" and four "fair," according to the report. One was not rated at all and the rest were "satisfactory." The 90-year-old Guajataca Dam created a lake 2½ miles long and as much as a mile wide in the scenic northwest part of Puerto Rico. It has long been considered a recreational attraction, where people go camping, hiking and fishing alongside rain forests. Still owned by PREPA, the dam has supplied hydroelectric power, irrigation and water needs. But little investment has gone into infrastructure in Puerto Rico, which is in bankruptcy to restructure its more than 72 billion in debt. The biggest single chunk of that debt belongs to PREPA, the bankrupt state-owned utility. That could pose problems for the commonwealth’s dam infrastructure. Most of Puerto Rico’s dams — 26 of the 38 — date to before 1960. Six were built a century ago. “The infrastructure in Puerto Rico is decades old,” said Miguel Soto-Class, president of the Center for a New Economy, a San Juan think tank. “That goes for water infrastructure, as well.” Soto-Class said that some of the island’s reservoirs need dredging and therefore don’t have enough water during droughts. That would also reduce the volume of water that could be held back in a heavy rain. The long-deferred investments make it more difficult to revamp infrastructure a bit at a time, Soto-Class said. When the water and sewer authority recently updated pipes, older pipes blew up because they couldn’t handle the additional pressure. Another major dam owner is the Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority. Its Carraizo, Carite and Rio Blanco dams for hydroelectric power and water supply haven’t been inspected since 2013, according to the National Inventory of Dams. The Guajataca Dam is just one example of the fragile infrastructure that has collapsed — along with Puerto Rico’s entire electrical transmission grid — raising the question of whether the island can and should be rebuilt to a higher standard than it has had. But that can’t be done by the dam owners. PREPA has about 9 billion in debt and the Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority has about 4.6 billion in debt, far more than they can service without any major new project. “We’ve been cutting corners for a long time in a lot of places,” Soto-Class said.

Following the disastrous mid-Michigan dam failures on May 19, 2020, many local residents blamed Boyce for the incident, with some lawsuits also targeting other state agencies as well. Below is a list of active lawsuits filed against Boyce Hydro and other parties in response to the dam failures and the flooding that followed. All listed lawsuits were filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan. On May 22, Kimberly Borchard, Timothy Dana and Holly Kovacs sued Boyce Hydro, its subsidiaries and co-owners, along with the Four Lakes Task Force (FLTF), on counts of negligence, nuisance, trespass, strict liability and intentional infliction of emotional distress. Charges against FLTF were dropped in May 2020. On March 31, 2021, it was decided the case will go to trial. A settlement conference is set for Oct. 6, 2021 before Judge Thomas Ludington, with a jury trial set for March 1, 2022. On May 22, Carol Clarkson and three other plaintiffs sued Boyce Hydro, its subsidiaries and co-owners on two counts of negligence, gross negligence, common law trespass, statutory trespass and trespass-nuisance. The lawsuit also initially named the Michigan Department of Natural Resources and the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy as defendants, though the plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed those charges on June 22. A settlement conference is set for Aug. 10, 2021 before Judge Thomas Ludington, with a jury trial set for Feb. 1, 2022. On May 27, Robert Woods and Holly Johnson sued the FLTF, Michigan’s Attorney General Dana Nessel, Midland County, Gladwin County, the State of Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy and the Department of Natural Resources, Boyce Hydro and all its subsidiaries and owner Lee Mueller on counts of negligence and gross negligence, trespass and two counts of deprivation of property. FLTF was dismissed as a party on Oct. 20, 2020. A settlement conference is set for July 21, 2021 before Judge Thomas Ludington, with a jury trial set for Feb. 1, 2022.

In the wake of the main spillway failure, a host of environmental groups (including American Rivers), the public, and governmental agencies responded. The takeaway was clear: dam safety across the United States needs to be improved. As America’s infrastructure continues to age and faces new threats posed by our changing climate, we need to be more proactive about making updates to the structures we rely on for public safety and resources.Aging Infrastructure, Changing Climate, Increased Risk“70% of the nation’s dams are over 50 years old. [They were] built with the best engineering and construction standards at the time; however, as the scientific and engineering experience has increased, many dams are not able to safely accommodate our current prediction of large floods and earthquakes” (American Society of Civil Engineers). The dams in the US collectively earned a ‘D’ on the ASCE report card released in 2017 (you can view the report here). Dams were not individually ‘graded’ in the report card, but Oroville is one of 15,498 (17% of catalogued dams nationwide) that have been identified as high-hazard potential dams, meaning that they pose a significant threat to human life or property if they fail.   Downstream Communities and EcosystemsAs the high-hazard grade would imply, this dam’s failure had serious ramifications for communities and ecosystems downstream. The Association of State Dam Safety Officials (ASDSO) stated that, “The Oroville Dam spillway incident was caused by a long-term systemic failure to recognize and address inherent spillway design and construction weaknesses, poor foundation bedrock quality, and deteriorated service spillway chute conditions.” It is now clear that the spillway was built on unstable bedrock (Independent Forensic Team Report Oroville Dam Spillway Incident) and as a result the concrete separating the bedrock and thousands of gallons of water per second rushing over the spillway was worn paper-thin over its years of use. This resulted in the concrete coming off the hillside in large chunks as the water eroded it away. Meanwhile, the emergency spillway’s efficacy had never been tested, so when it was forced into use, it too eroded the hillside. The Department of Water Resources (DWR) was left with no choice but to order the evacuation of the three counties (188,000 people) that would be impacted in the case of a complete dam failure.Oroville Dam spillway debris in Feather River | Photo by Dale Kolke, CA DWRThe spillway failure in 2017 was more than a scare, it had negative impacts on downstream communities, ecosystems, and the dam owners; the evacuation displaced thousands of people, negatively impacted the ecosystem by washing tons of sediment downstream, and cost DWR over 1 billion to repair (which does not include the economic impacts on the community). Salmon and steelhead fisheries were already impacted by the construction of the dam, which blocked them from reaching their natal spawning grounds. After the spillway failure, sediment from the hillside choked out miles of habitat and anything living there.Updating Infrastructure in the Face of Climate ChangeSince February 2017, DWR has completed the reconstruction of the main spillway so its foundation is better anchored into the bedrock, reinforced the emergency spillway with concrete (though it still is not safe to rely on that spillway regularly), among other projects. Oroville Dam is looking stronger, but there’s still a lot of work that needs to be done to reduce its public safety risk. It is not alone: thousands of dams need to be dramatically updated or run the risk of failure.Evacuees affected by the Oroville spillway evacuation notice at Beale Air Force Base | Photo by U.S. Air Force Photo/Airman Tristan D. VigliancoUpdating our infrastructure is important, but it’s critical that it’s done in a way that is relevant to the context we live in: a changing and increasingly variable climate. More extreme weather events such as floods or drought have become commonplace. These climatic variations put increased strain on the infrastructure in terms of ability to function during extreme weather events (i.e. hydroelectric power generation during droughts and ability to safely store water in a Probable Maximum Flood). Even since DWR reconstructed both spillways on Oroville Dam, the release capability still falls short of the standard for a Probable Maximum Flood situation, putting the dam and the people and ecosystem downstream at risk (Independent Forensic Team Report).A New Approach to Dam SafetyThe bad ASCE report card grade proves that we need to be proactive about monitoring dams to avoid disasters like what happened in 2017, especially when the environment in which they exist is changing as well. At the same time, dam safety departments nationwide are insufficiently funded and staffed and cannot keep up with thousands of dam inspections that need to happen annually. To alleviate some of the pressure on under-resourced agencies, some states are now requiring private dam owners to either pay for their inspections through annual fees or directly hire qualified engineers to complete inspections and submit inspection reports to the states. These approaches dramatically increase the capacity of dam safety offices and hold owners accountable, therefore increasing the overall safety of dams.American Rivers is a leader in creating innovative solutions for water storage. For dams whose impacts exceed their benefits, American Rivers has long advocated that the most effective approach to dam safety is dam removal.

Risk Associated With Dam Failures Grows in Oklahoma, But Safety Funding Lags | StateImpact Oklahoma Menu search Environment, Education, Energy, Health And Justice: Policy to People A reporting project of  NPR member stations The Hall Park Dam in northeast Norman, Okla., was recently reclassified from a low hazard dam to a high hazard dam because of development behind the structure.Logan Layden / StateImpact Oklahoma December 11, 2014 | 6:00 am Risk Associated With Dam Failures Grows in Oklahoma, But Safety Funding Lags Logan Layden BioRecent Stories Logan Layden is a reporter and managing editor for StateImpact Oklahoma. He is a native of McAlester, Oklahoma and graduated from the University of Oklahoma in 2009. Logan spent three years as a state capitol reporter and local host of All Things Considered for NPR member station KGOU in Norman and six years as a reporter with StateImpact from 2011 to 2017. Most recently, he was news director for McAlester Radio before returning to public radio in 2020. Joe Wertz / StateImpact Oklahoma Families and a fisherman along the spillway beneath Broken Bow Dam in southeastern Oklahoma. Oklahoma has nearly 5,000 dams, more than most other states. When they were built, they were classified based on the risk their failure would pose to people and property.But for many dams, it’s been decades since that risk was evaluated, and the potential hazard has changed because Oklahoma has changed. There are houses, roads and people where there weren’t before.How did Oklahoma get so far behind in the dam reclassification game?Mainly, the cost. Reclassifying dams into proper categories — low, significant or high-hazard, if loss of life could result in a dam’s failure — is expensive and time consuming. The Oklahoma Water Resources Board oversees the state’s dam safety program, and Director Yohanes Sugeng is trying to meet a pressing public safety need without a lot of money.“We have really limited resources, and so our resources, we tend to put all in high-hazard dams and significant hazard dams and kind of put low-hazard dams on the back burner a little bit,” Sugeng says.The problem is some of those low-hazard dams would be considered high hazard today, after decades of downstream development. Oklahoma’s first dam classifications were done in the 1970s. And for many dams, that remains the only time their hazard potential was assessed.The Association of Dam Safety Officials puts out yearly reports comparing how states handle dam safety, the latest of which shows the amount of the state budget Oklahoma directs to dam safety is a fraction of the national average. But an influx of federal money in 2009 kick-started the reclassification effort.“So, from this we kind of found out, like wow, it’s been 20 or 30 years,” Sugeng says.The funding meant OWRB could afford an aerial assessment of the low hazard dams, and about 600 of them didn’t look so low hazard anymore. Further mapping and site visits narrowed the total number of dams needing reclassification to about 30.“Since that time when many of the classifications were done, there’s been more development in these areas,” the OWRB’s Cole Perryman says. “And we’ve really tried to go back since 2009 and reclassify them.” Logan Layden / StateImpact Oklahoma The Hall Park Dam in northeast Norman, Okla., was recently reclassified from a low hazard dam to a high hazard dam because of development behind the structure. Dam OwnershipDams in Oklahoma are owned by state, federal and local governments, as well as utility companies, but about half of the state’s dams are privately owned. Private dam owners are supposed to get their low hazard dams inspected every five years and report when downstream development necessitates reclassification.“With over 4,000 dams, the response from the owners has been kind of low on that,” Sugeng says, again emphasizing the prohibitive costs associated with reclassification. “They don’t have the resources to suddenly follow our rules.”Private dam owners have to foot the bill for upgrades if, say, their low hazard dam is reclassified as high hazard, and it can costs hundreds of thousands of dollars. Instead the OWRB has so far focused on dams owned by conservation districts and cities, like Norman, which are better able to pay for such expensive fixes.Norman Public Works Director Shawn O’Leary says when Norman annexed the tiny community of Hall Park in the early 2000s it didn’t think much at all about the swimming hole local residents had been using since the 1940s. Logan Layden / StateImpact Oklahoma Norman Capital Projects Manager Scott Sturtz (left) and Public Works Director Shawn O'Leary say their city will spend more than 1 million for two dams that needed reclassification. “Frankly, we didn’t know much about the dam. It’s something we inhered,” O’Leary says. Once he got to know it better, he noticed “a lot of problems with tree growth and lack of maintenance and the dam was I think a foot shorter than it should’ve been.”So the city redesigned and rebuilt the Hall Park Dam, at a cost of about 300,000.“We worked with the neighborhood — Hall Park neighborhood. Several of them weren’t very happy,” O’Leary says.Alice Lindsay, who lives right next to the dam, is one of those unhappy neighbors. From her backyard, she describes what her view used to be like.“All of that area, that dam right there, was covered with trees, some of them 100 years old. There was a natural stream that ran right down there. It was a beautiful area,” she says. “They came in and now we look like a gravel pit or a rock quarry out here, like the great Mississippi is gonna come through and they got to block it up.”Norman officials would’ve rather not pulled those old trees up, or spent 300,000 dollars, but O’Leary says there was no choice. The Hall Park Dam was now high hazard, because if the worst-case scenario happened — some massive flood without the dam being upgraded — the results could be dangerous.“The force of the additional floodwaters then causes a breach of the dam,” O’Leary says. “And of course a breach of the dam could have caused damage to properties, it could’ve flooded people, there could’ve been people harmed downstream from the dam, Robinson Street could’ve been overtopped.”Oklahoma has used federal money to add staff to its dam safety program, and is offering free inspectors of low-hazards dams. The idea is, going forward, is for the state to avoid once again falling decades behind.

Felicia Frazar - The Seguin Gazette Editor's Note Editor’s Note: This is the third of a series of stories that will explore the effects of the recent draining of Lake Dunlap. Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Copy article link Save They gathered along the banks of what used to be Lake Wood and talked.A group of neighbors, property owners, friends and elected officials looked out into the forest that sprouted up in the three years since a spill gate failure drained the lake, leaving only the river channel.“Here’s the wood where the lake once stood,” resident Dale Schellenberg said.They understand the pain those on Lake Dunlap felt as they watched the water rush out of the 91-year-old hydroelectric dam.Residents here watched the almost 100-year-old dam at Lake Wood face a similar fate when a spill gate malfunctioned on March 10, 2016, draining the lake they love.From the loss of aquatic life and trees, to failing retaining walls and bulkheads, to an overgrowth of grass, brush and trees towering 25 to 30 feet high in the lake bed, they’ve lived the loss of Lake Wood for the past three years. Or, as property owner Joe Solansky said, for 1,169 days. “We feel real bad about the situation because we know what it is going to look like in a short while,” Solansky said about the failure at Lake Dunlap. “We feel it, we see it. They’re feeling it right now, but they ain’t quite seen it all yet. That is not going to be a quick fix because they got a lot of hurdles to be able to correct it.” Rushing water flows over the spill gates of Lake Wood Dam on Monday, May 20, 2019 at Lake Wood, just east of Gonzales. The flow of water is increased as the Army Corps of Engineers continues to release water from Canyon Lake. Felicia Frazar - The Seguin Gazette Long-termThe long-term effects the loss of the water has had on properties and the land surrounding the former lake’s banks is concerning,  Schellenberg said.“Your bulkheads fail. Without having the water pressure against them, they start falling in,” he said. “But the main thing is the growth. How do you clear out this growth? If you were to put the gate back in place and it was to start filling up, look what you’ve got — a pasture that is filling up.”A look around the banks of where the water reached three years prior shows the depths of the impact on the flora and fauna in the area. Cypress trees are either dead or dying due to the lack of water. The decades old pecan trees that line the shores are suffering, Solansky said.“These big pecan trees, we’ve lucked out this last year, two years, we’ve had some pretty wet weather that is keeping their roots as well it can,” he said. “These things grew up around shallow water because of the level of the lake. There are cypress trees and pecan trees that have cratered. Like a stack of dominoes, when one falls another falls, then another.”The environmental damage goes beyond the foliage when the lake drained, property owner J.R. Anderson said.“Parks and Wildlife did a review and there were 122,000 mussels killed — giant washboards and the threatened golden orb,” he said. “What is the impact on the flora and fauna and how they are going to respond to that?”The cattle roaming on the lake bed present another issue, Schellenberg said.“The water is a barrier for raising cattle here on this lake … and without that water being there, those cattle were free going into the lake bed and roamed on into whoever else’s property they wanted to roam onto,” he said. The immediate reactionLake Dunlap residents will go through several stages.“First you’re in shock, then you’re in grief, then you try to build optimism,” Anderson said. “We’ve had to go through a transition of which all of 2016 (no information) was shared, 2017 we woke up and started doing what Lake Dunlap started doing in hour two of their event. Now we are in year three and we’re looking for solutions because we’ve been told for three years ‘we can’t do anything until we find funding.’”Now, the residents are doing the leg work of trying to get their lake back, Anderson said.“We rolled up our sleeves and we’ve been working with the legislature and we’re going out looking for funding solutions, working with the city, working with the county in conjunction with Parks and Wildlife, with our reps and our senators in trying to identify opportunities and options,” he said. “It almost feels like we’re doing their job for them, but we know they have their hands tied as well. They are doing their efforts.”With the second of the six hydro-electric dams under GBRA now out of commission, the group feels a tinge of hope a solution will come forward.“Now that the Dunlap event has occurred it has put renewed awareness on that, it has put significantly more pressure on their board and their staff to respond to that larger, squeakier wheel because of the contracts on water supply and wastewater and consumption, so that now they are at the capital,” Anderson said. “We have a renewed hope that now something is going to get done.”The group agreed the answer and solution won’t happen overnight. And they don’t feel like placing blame is the answer.“The current administration from GBRA inherited a used vehicle that was wore out when they inherited it. It was in bad shape and then it fell apart on them. Then it looks like they’re to blame,” resident Dave Borrough said. “But 80 to 90 years of steel being underwater like this, you can expect things like this to fall apart.” The spill gate that failed on Lake Wood dam was placed along side the river, which is where it has stayed. Photo taken Monday, May 20, 2019 at Lake Wood, just east of Gonzales. Felicia Frazar - The Seguin Gazette Economic impactWhile Lake Wood sits just outside the Gonzales city limits, Mayor Connie Kacir said it is still part of the city’s way of life and she is concerned about the lake remaining empty.Not long after the spill gate failed, Solansky and Schellenberg reached out to Kacir.“I met with them. I immediately put on my next agenda and we adopted a resolution in support of the lake and those efforts for rebuilding the lake,” she said. “I also have some action to look at funding an economic impact study. This is not within the corporate city limits, but it is a quality of life. It does have a direct impact on sales tax that are spent in the city and comes back to benefit us financially.”While a study will get the cold, hard numbers, Gonzales County Commissioner Kevin LaFleur said the impact is visible.“There hasn’t been a study done, but from the volume of people we see out here, you know it has got have an impact,” he said. “The family gets together and has to go other places.”Just as in Guadalupe County, LaFleur said property taxes are a concern residents have.“What we are finding is everyone is up in arms about the taxes,” he said. It has been an ongoing battle. “The county doesn’t set the appraisals, the appraisal board does.”Just like visitors aren’t coming to town, lakefront property owners are leaving town to get their recreational fix.Anderson and Solansky both said they’ve traveled out of town to fish or enjoy a peaceful, relaxing weekend by the waterfront, instead of getting to stay where they love.“My wife and I went to Lake Texana and we met a couple of people who said they routinely came here,” Anderson said. “They mentioned they had not been here since the dam failure and thought about dropping by to look at it since we shared with them what it looked like. That is at least some people that go camping that had been impacted.”Anderson, who purchased his property for retirement, said Lake Wood was a place where his children grew up and learned the lessons a lake has to offer. He hopes to one day pass that on to his grandchildren.The same is true for LaFleur, whose family spans generations of living along the banks of Lake Wood.Working to make a changeKacir reached out to the city’s state legislators — District 17 State Rep. John Cyrier and State Sen. Lois Kolkhorst of District 18 — for any assistance they may be able to provide.“(Cyrier and I) had many discussions on how the state may look at supplemental funding to assist in repairing the dam and the spill gate,” she said. “To date, what we have seen is Rep. Cyrier has co-authored some bills with Kolkhorst. He spoke on the House floor Saturday night … and he was speaking on the Senate floor on Sunday. The state is looking at some appropriations through the general fund to hopefully repair that dam.”The mayor is hopeful that if passed, the bill will help funnel sales tax dollars to recreational funding.“I think those dollars would be well spent, in highest and best use, for additional growth, additional amenities, comprehensive plan to not only rebuild what we knew as the lake here in Gonzales but to have that vision expanded, and really be a catalyst for tourism that comes back to benefit the city and the county as well,” Kacir said.Residents fear the lake will not return, which is why The Friends of Lake Wood pooled their money and hired a lobbyist to fight on their behalf.“The Dunlap situation actually just enhanced everything of our efforts to get something done about the lake,” Solansky said. “It may not serve GBRA’s purpose for water or whatever … but we want the lake and that is why we went with the lobbyist. I want to see something done now. I’m hoping this week things will materialize in Austin, Washington, wherever this is going to happen at to get this thing back. We have the love of the lake just like those people, but we’ve been without it for three years and three months.”The group agreed that to get things done and back to normal, everyone needs to work together.“There has been a tremendous impact for us and we’ve sat idly by with diminishing hope, expecting something to occur and we’re at the will of the board of GBRA,” Anderson said. “Hopefully, now we have something to hang our hope on.” Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Copy article link Save +4 Residents and business owners around Lake Dunlap adjust to lakeless life Adolfo Castro hasn’t had running water in his home since Saturday.

Michigan dam failures prompt re-assessment of safety - International Water Power Jump to page content Accessibility FREE Newsletter Latest hydro news and technology Log in or Register Home News Features Project Profiles Magazine Info Events Jobs Buyers Guide White Papers Press Releases Company A - Z Dam Engineering Yearbook Digital Edition Subscribe Online Michigan dam failures prompt re-assessment of safety 26 February 2021 Dam safety in the US state of Michigan was thrown into the spotlight after the failure of Edenville and Sanford Dams during May 2020. On 19 May 2020, the Edenville and Sanford Dams near Midland in the US state of Michigan, failed. Over a 48-hour period more than 15-20cm of heavy rain fell locally and subsequent rainfall placed additional stress on the many dams located on the Tobacco and Tittabawassee Rivers.Edenville, along with Secord, Smallwood and Sanford, is part of a four-dam system on the Tittabawassee River. Due to the heavy rainfall and already saturated state of the water system, the river surpassed the flood stage in many areas. At around 5.30pm on 19 May a portion of Edenville Dam’s earthen embankment failed, causing an uncontrolled release of impounded water downstream towards the town of Edenville, Sanford Lake and Sanford Dam. The level of Sanford Lake rose quickly and by 7.45pm Sanford Dam had overtopped and failed. The combined failures sent a torrent of water rushing down the already swollen Tittabawassee River through the village of Sanford, towards the cities of Midland and Saginaw.More than 11,000 people were evacuated and 2500 structures were damaged by the floods but no major injuries or fatalities were reported. Preliminary damage estimates were in the region of US250million.Revoked licenceUntil 25 September 2018, all four dams on the Tittabawassee River were hydroelectric and regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). However, FERC revoked the licence to generate power at Edenville Dam as, for more than 14 years, dam owner Boyce Hydro Power had reportedly refused to follow orders to increase dam spillway capacity to handle severe floods. Regulatory authority was then transferred over to the Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy (EGLE) in Michigan. Prior to 2018, EGLE says it had no regulatory authority over the operation and maintenance of the dam. It wasn’t until this authority was ‘abruptly’ transferred over that the department was able to receive and review decades worth of records and inspection reports. These had previously been unavailable as they were protected under federal critical infrastructure laws. EGLE says that until it was able to review the records, it had no factual basis to take legal action under state law to force Boyce Hydro Power to improve dam capacity to withstand severe flooding. At the same time, EGLE was working with a local stakeholder group to purchase Edenville Dam from Boyce Hydro. The group, the Four Lakes Task Force, planned to upgrade the dam and reacquire its federal hydropower generating licence. Unfortunately, tragedy struck before the plans could be fully realised.On 27 May 2020, Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer directed EGLE to lead an investigation into the causes of the disaster and examine the storm event, the integrity of the dam and dam owner compliance, along with the wider issue of dam safety in Michigan, to prevent such an event from happening again.Historic flooding as seen from Poseyville road towards Downtown Midland on 20 May 2020. The combined failures of Edenville and Sandford Dams sent a torrent of water rushing down the already swollen Tittabawassee River through the village of Sanford towards the cities of Midland and Saginaw.Status reportOn 1 September 2020, EGLE submitted its initial status report to Whitmer to summarise department action taken during the three and a half months after the dam failures and review state dam safety operations. The Preliminary Report on the Edenville Dam Failure, Response Efforts and Programme Reviews, was the first in a series of reports that EGLE would receive from investigating teams.“EGLE staff have been on the ground since day one of this tragedy and we will continue to do all that we can to help the residents of mid-Michigan and the communities in which they live, work and play,” said EGLE Director Liesl Clark. “We will continue to support, in an open and transparent way, the search for answers as to how these dam failures happened and why. We will also thoroughly review any recommendations and findings in future reports with an eye toward improving our department programmes and overall dam safety in Michigan.”EGLE said that the exact cause of the dam failures will not be known until a thorough independent investigation has been completed. As the failure of Edenville Dam was likely to have impacted Sanford Dam, EGLE and FERC agreed to establish one investigation team to comprehensively review all contributing factors. In late May 2020, FERC and EGLE directed dam owner Boyce Hydro to assemble an investigation team and provide resumes to FERC and EGLE for review and acceptance. It is standard FERC protocol to require the dam owner to fund the dam failure investigations, but the dam owner is not permitted to be involved in the investigative process. In the following weeks, Boyce submitted resumes for six “very qualified” team members, which were unanimously accepted by FERC and EGLE. However, after an initial meeting on 17 June 2020, Boyce failed to finalise contracts with team members to commence the investigation. After several attempts to compel Boyce to do so, FERC, in consultation with EGLE, took over the investigation team contracts and pressed forward with the investigation. On 13 August 2020, the independent investigation team was directed to define their own scope and not take direction from EGLE, FERC or Boyce. The team has extensive experience probing dam failures (several members participated in the investigation of the 2017 failure of the Oroville Dam in California) and anticipates that this investigation will take approximately 12-18 months. “With the knowledge and experience these professionals bring to the independent investigation I am confident that we will get a clear picture of what went wrong with the two dams and why,” Liesl Clark said. “Transparency is extremely important as this process moves forward and EGLE is ready to provide any information necessary to help get answers to this tragedy.”The five team members are: John France - team lead and expert in geotechnical engineering and emergency action planning Irfan Alvi - expert in structural engineering and human factors Jennifer Williams - expert in geotechnical engineering Steve Higinbotham - expert in hydraulic structuresArthur Miller - expert in hydraulic engineering, hydrology, and reservoir operations.Dam Safety Task ForceOn 3 September 2020 EGLE announced the 19 members who would comprise the Michigan Dam Safety Task Force and provide recommendations on policy, budget, legislative and enforcement reforms to prevent future dam failures across the state.“The Michigan Dam Safety Task Force members have broad expertise and knowledge in all areas related to dam safety,” said Liesl Clark. “The historic rain event which led to the dam failure and catastrophic 500-year flooding event in Mid-Michigan illuminated the consequences of inadequate investing in infrastructure. It also points to potential improvements that should be made in policies, procedures, funding and regulations. The task force will analyse those areas and others and we are eager to see their recommendations.”The task force is expected to release its findings early in 2021 and they will complement the other in-depth internal and external reviews taking place.Sanford Dam in Michigan. The level of Sanford Lake rose quickly and by 7.45pm Sanford Dam had overtopped and failed on 18 May 2020.Association of State Dam Safety OfficialsEGLE also enlisted the service of the Association of State Dam Safety Officials (ASDSO) to perform a thorough review of Michigan’s dam safety programme. On 1 October 2020 this was presented at a meeting of the Michigan Dam Safety Task Force.The task force will analyse the report as part of its review and help state regulators and lawmakers prioritise recommendations to determine which are the most necessary and impactful to undertake.The ASDSO report concludes that, when compared to a model programme, Michigan’s is understaffed and constrained by limited time, resources and budget; Michigan’s investments in dam safety have been lacking for decades, which increases the risk to public safety and the environment; and owners of high hazard dams should perform detailed engineering re-evaluations to uncover latent dam safety defects commonly found in ageing structures.“The ASDSO report acknowledges the decades of underinvestment in infrastructure in Michigan, which includes many dams that, if they failed, would put downstream residents’ lives in jeopardy,” Clark commented. “We, along with the task force members, will take a close look at the many thoughtful recommendations in the report and welcome working collaboratively with the Legislature and other stakeholders to strengthen Michigan’s dam safety programme while also holding owners accountable for safely operating their dams.”The peer review team evaluated EGLE’s programme relative to ASDSO’s governing regulations and how a programme matches up with ASDSO’s Model Dam Safety Programme. The success of any dam safety programme, the team said in its report, depends upon:Adequate funding.Quality physical inspections.Dedication and commitment of the regulatory agencies.Due diligence of the dam owner or operator.While Michigan’s dam safety staff “are dedicated, well-educated, experienced engineers that are doing the best they can,” the ASDSO team concluded that the programme should ideally have 11 staff, including three senior dam safety engineers and three junior safety engineers to oversee approximately 1060 state-regulated dams. Michigan’s programme currently has two dam safety engineers and one supervisor with a third dam safety engineer to be hired soon. In the Fiscal Year 2021 state budget recently signed by Governor Whitmer there is funding for hiring two more dam safety engineers, which would bring the total to five.For years Michigan has not had rigorous enforcement of dam safety violations, which the team called “commonly accepted practice in Michigan.” It also recommended adding into statute a requirement that owners of ageing high hazard dams perform periodic detailed evaluations of their facilities.The ASDSO report outlined recommended changes that would have to be made by the legislature. It said the dam safety programme lacks the authority to require owners to obtain a permit to operate and maintain dams in a safe condition, nor to annually report on maintenance, operation and engineering investigations. Also, there are no requirements for owners to maintain key records, periodic exercising of emergency action plans or for owners of high hazard dams to provide proof of financial responsibility or security for the continued safe operation and maintenance of their dam.A collaborative effort between EGLE, ASDSO and FERC was also called for to simplify the transfer of key information when the state takes over regulation of a former hydroelectric dam. The state of Michigan had to file Freedom of Information Act requests with FERC to obtain key documents and reports about the dam after FERC had revoked the hydropower licence for Edenville Dam.The report suggested Michigan should follow the examples set by other states, including Pennsylvania and New Jersey, in offering a revolving loan programme to provide grants and low interest loans to public owners of high hazard dams that need rehabilitation. Without investment in dam safety over many decades, the need for maintenance has increased as dams have aged. “National experience has demonstrated that a state organised and funded programme for grants and low interest loans is critical to achieving real progress in rehabilitating publicly owned dams,” the report said.The American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) 2018 Report Card for Michigan’s Infrastructure and the 21st Century Infrastructure Commission Report were also mentioned; both of which cited underinvestment in dam maintenance. The ASCE Report Card gave Michigan a grade of C- and said “Michigan must make more progress to address dams in need of repair or removal. Expanded funding is needed to provide additional staffing for the EGLE dam safety unit, and for resources for dam owners to address dam repair or dam removal projects.” The Infrastructure Commission Report estimated that Michigan needed US227 million in state funding over 20 years to support maintenance and removal of dams.UnacceptableIn response to the Michigan dam failures, Malcolm Woolf, President and CEO of the National Hydropower Association (NHA), said that as an industry, dam safety is “our top priority”. “Non-compliance with safety standards is unacceptable,” he stated. “While undoubtedly additional facts will emerge as FERC and other responsible agencies conduct investigations, initial reports indicate that, after years of unsuccessfully directing the owner to modernise the facility to meet federal dam safety standards, FERC revoked the owner’s licence to operate in 2018. The hydropower industry supports the necessary actions by FERC to ensure that dams are safe, remain safe, and meet performance expectations particularly during extraordinary flood events such as this one.”Michigan Congresswoman Debbie Dingell, along with Congressman John Moolenaar, introduced bipartisan legislation that was written in response to the aftermath of the Michigan dam failures.LegislationOn 10 December 2020, Congresswoman Debbie Dingell and Congressman John Moolenaar from Michigan, introduced bipartisan legislation that was written in response to the aftermath of the Michigan dam failures, and makes reforms and improvements to dam and hydropower safety operations and oversight. The lawmakers’ legislation, the National Dam and Hydropower Safety Improvements Act of 2020, would enhance dam and hydropower safety operation requirements nationwide and aims to modernise existing infrastructure through the development of new best practices and improved communications between FERC and states.“In the midst of a global health pandemic and economic devastation, Michigan experienced a catastrophic, avoidable infrastructure collapse. The breach of the Edenville and Sanford Dams caused extensive damage in Michigan and its downstream communities. It drowned homes, businesses, and whole cities,” said Dingell. “It is clear there are serious gaps in existing laws that need to be addressed and this could have been prevented. We can never let this happen again in any city in America with a high hazard dam. I look forward to continuing to advance this legislation next Congress and hope to enlist strong bipartisan support from my colleagues.”“I’ve been working hard to help our community recover, including securing approval for more than US100 million in federal assistance that has come to our community to rebuild homes, small businesses, and private wells, as well as roads and bridges,” Moolenaar added. “However, there’s no doubt that the federal and state regulators failed our community when they were working with an uncooperative private dam owner. Those failures compounded over more than a decade into a devastating event that affected the lives of thousands of residents. This bipartisan legislation will address gaps in existing law and do more to ensure compliance with the safety regulations that are paramount to protecting the people of Michigan.”The National Dam and Hydropower Safety Improvements Act of 2020 would specifically:Require FERC to provide a briefing and a report to Congress on the findings of the independent forensic analysis of the Edenville Dam and Sanford Dam failures.Add a new requirement to section 10 of the Federal Power Act to mandate dam and project works meet FERC’s dam safety requirements and to require the licensee to manage, operate, and maintain the dam and project works consistent with dam safety requirements.Amend section 15 of the Federal Power Act to require FERC to issue a new licence only if the Commission determines the dam and other project works meet the Commission’s dam safety requirements and that the operating conditions of the licence are consistent with those requirements.Require FERC to establish procedures for evaluating the financial health of prospective hydropower licensees.Require FERC to convene a technical conference with state representatives to examine best practices for dam safety.Striving to helpEGLE Director, Liesl Eichler Clark, said that since the moment the dams failed, EGLE has continued to work with local, state, and federal partners to help affected communities recover from their losses. “We cannot overstate the extent to which the emergency preparedness planning and swift action from first responders helped prevent more disastrous outcomes,” she said, adding that public servants at all levels worked incredibly fast to fight back in every way possible and protect the community. “I am very proud of our team’s work every day—our commitment to leadership, making decisions rooted in data, and partnering with the communities we serve. This tragedy reminds us that risk cannot be eliminated entirely. But at EGLE,” Clark says, “we are striving to move Michigan ever closer to that goal.” MembersMembers of the Michigan Dam Safety Task Force are:Melinda Bacon, Senior Consultant, SME Engineering Consulting of Plymouth.John Broschak, Vice President of Generation Operations and Compression, Consumers Energy.Bryan Burroughs, Executive Director, Michigan Trout Unlimited.Brett Fessell (invited), River Restoration Ecologist, Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians.Dr. Marty Holtgren, Executive Director, Muskegon River Watershed Assembly.Dr. Dana Infante, Assistant Director of AgBioResearch, Michigan State University.Douglas Jester, Partner, 5 Lakes Energy.Jim Kochevar, General Manager of Michigan Operations, Cleveland-Cliffs.Paul Malocha, Stantec Consulting Services; member of Association of State Dam Safety OfficialsTanya Paslawski, President, Michigan Electric and Gas Association.Evan Pratt, Water Resources Commissioner, Washtenaw County.Bill Rustem, advisor to former Michigan governors William Milliken and Rick Snyder.Dr. Stan Vitton, Professor of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Michigan Technological University.Abigail Watkins,Director of Emergency Services, Newaygo County.Glen Wiczorek, Senior Utilities Engineer, City of Ann Arbor.Representing the State of Michigan are:Paul Ajegba, Director, Michigan Department of Transportation.Liesl Clark, Director, EGLE.Dan Eichinger, Director, Michigan Department of Natural Resources.Dan Scripps, Chairman, Michigan Public Service Commission.

Mullaperiyar Dam in Danger: Will Tamil Nadu’s boon be Kerala’s doom? ISQUEER+ 30 June 2022 12:38 PM Subscribe | Donate × Loading... ☰ ECOLOGY OPINION WORLD INDIA SPORT LIFE HEALTH GENDER VIDEO S.G.VOMBATKERE | 19 AUGUST, 2018 Mullaperiyar Dam in Danger: Will Tamil Nadu’s boon be Kerala’s doom? Dam failure a real fear The current floods in Kerala are unprecedented and clearly a national disaster. In the midst of this disaster, there is fear for the structural safety of the Mullaperiyar dam on the Periyar river. Madras Engineers Colonel John Pennycuick commenced construction of this 173-ft high dam in 1887, and it was commissioned in 1895. This gravity dam was considered an engineering marvel of those times. With the dam’s catchment area entirely within present-day Kerala, it diverts some of the water eastwards into Tamil Nadu’s Vaigai river. This is supported by an agreement of 1886 between the British Madras Presidency and the kingdom of Travancore that gave Madras Presidency rights over “all the waters” of Mullaperiyar reservoir to relieve drought in southern Madras Presidency. Today, even though located in Kerala, Mullaperiyar dam is maintained and operated by Tamil Nadu. The design water storage level of this 133-years-old, 173-ft high dam is 142-ft. It is reported that this storage level may have been exceeded in the current flood situation, because the inflow from the catchment into the reservoir exceeds the outflow over the spillway and after opening all the dam sluice gates. This constitutes a threat to the dam structure especially if water rises to near or over the top. This may well lead to catastrophic failure of the dam if the on-going rainfall in the catchment does not abate. Already, the full-scale release of water from Mullaperiyar and 32 other dams in Kerala has caused or exacerbated the heavy flooding in the state. But apart from the possibility of catastrophic failure, following a technical inspection by Chairman CWC, the water level was lowered from the full water level of 152-ft to 142-ft and again to 136-ft. But following certain recommended strengthening and repair measures, the maximum storage level was again raised to 142-ft by Tamil Nadu. Kerala has been asking that the water level be restricted to 136-ft since the dam is very old and may not be able to withstand greater hydraulic pressure, possibly leading to dam failure and catastrophic downstream disaster. Kerala also has alleged that there are leaks and cracks in the structure. However, Tamil Nadu, which operates the dam, has been insisting on maintaining water at 142-ft, obviously since it can then get more water into Vaigai river. This difference of perspective, namely dam safety (Kerala) versus water availability (Tamil Nadu) was referred to the Supreme Court. Further, on account of the dam’s age and its structural condition, Kerala advocates dismantling of Mullaperiyar dam and construction of a new dam downstream. Effective reservoir management demands that dams have adequate storage capacity before heavy inflow begins, by discharging water to lower the storage level. This can be done only when there is scientific forecasting. But according to South Asia Network on Dams, Rivers and People (SANDRP) [“Idukki Dam releases water when Kerala is in Floods: Could this have been avoided?”.. “the unprecedented floods and dam water releases also raise the questions about flood forecasting and advance action by Central Water Commission (CWC), India’s only flood forecasting agency. When we see CWC’s FF website, we are shocked to find that CWC has absolutely NO flood forecasting sites, neither level forecasting, nor inflow forecasting [for Kerala]. CWC has only flood monitoring sites in Kerala.” This serious shortcoming has resulted in panic release of water and heavy loss of life and property, besides raising the risk of Mullaperiyar dam failure. On August 16, 2018, accepting the grave flood situation in Kerala, the Supreme Court agreed to hear a plea seeking Centre’s mediation between Kerala and Tamil Nadu governments on the issue of the water crossing the 142-ft level. Clearly, the catastrophic failure of the dam, which can cause disaster to 3-million people, is seen as a possibility which cannot be discounted. The Supreme Court has asked that the water level be reduced by 3-ft to 139-ft, and added that judges were not experts to frame a disaster management plan or assess the dangers of water levels in Mullaperiyar reservoir. It is to be fervently prayed that the rainfall in Mullaperiyar catchment and also other dam catchments reduces very quickly, thereby reducing the risk of dam failure. In the context of on-going climate change triggering extreme events such as the present extremely heavy rainfall in Kerala and with chance of such recurrence, governments need to examine measures very seriously and urgently. These measures are establishing adequate flood forecasting stations, dismantling of old dams and simultaneously stopping deforestation in the name of infrastructure development. (Major General S.G.

Hundreds of people are still missing and more than six thousand are homeless. And after last summer’s hurricanes, U.S. citizens in Houston and Puerto Rico escaped death but were forced to evacuate when dams were flooded. Dam failure can be catastrophic for people, property, and power—and the risks are rising, due to lack of investment in maintenance, growing vulnerability to climate change, and the demonstrated potential of cyberattacks.The Catastrophic Consequences of Dam Failure The worst dam failure in history, in China’s Henan Province in 1975, killed tens of thousands of people. When the 400 foot-high Banqiao Dam burst, its 17.4 billion cubic feet of water destroyed 62 smaller dams and levees downstream. The injuries, water contamination, and food shortages that followed increased the total death toll to an estimated 200,000 people.According to the International Commission on Large Dams, more than 59,000 dams have reservoirs big enough to flood entire communities. The decaying Kariba hydroelectric dam between Zimbabwe and Zambia holds the largest volume of water of any manmade lake. Its collapse could inundate millions and destroy a dam downstream in Mozambique.In the United States, more than 2,000 of the 15,000 U.S. dams with high-hazard potential are considered deficient due to a lack of investment in maintenance—leading the American Society of Civil Engineers to give the country’s dam safety a grade of “D” on its Infrastructure Report Card.In addition to life and property, the failure of a hydroelectric dam threatens energy security. Hydropower generates almost eight percent of U.S. electricity. The share can be much higher in some developing countries, such as Brazil, where dams generate more than three quarters of the country’s electricity. The Itaipu Dam, between Brazil and Paraguay, generates enough electricity each year to power the entire world for two days.At-Risk Dams Not Prepared for Extreme WeatherExtreme weather—which is becoming more severe and frequent as the climate changes—is striking this critical infrastructure more often, with devastating results. After Hurricane Harvey, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers released water from Houston’s Addicks and Barker dams—two of the most high-risk dams in the country—inundating several thousand buildings with controlled releases to avoid destroying most of the city. In Puerto Rico, Hurricane Maria cracked the Guajataca Dam, while downpours began to erode its spillway. The town of Isabela flooded and hundreds of people in the surrounding towns were forced to evacuate.In February 2017, torrential rains filled California’s Oroville Dam—the tallest in the country—above capacity. After discovering that the original spillway had a sinkhole, officials diverted water to an emergency spillway, but the resulting erosion threatened the concrete structure above. With dam failure looming, nearly 200 thousand people were evacuated—and thousands of evacuees were stuck in traffic, unable to escape the danger zone. Luckily, the dam held; but if it had failed, water and power supplies for millions of California residents would have been disrupted.Across the world, the risks of dam failure are increasing, because engineering plans and risk management strategies are not keeping pace with the deteriorating infrastructure or escalating extremes in weather and climate. According to Kathleen White of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the designs of existing dams were modeled on hydro-climatic data now made obsolete by climate change.As 100-year floods or rain events become more common, U.S. dam operators’ standard safety instrument, the Emergency Action Plan, should be updated to reflect the increasing likelihood of potential emergencies. But shockingly, the U.S. Association of State Dam Safety Officials found that more than one fifth of the  dams whose failure could cause fatalities and property damage did not even have such a plan.Dam Systems Vulnerable to CyberattacksMuch of our critical infrastructure is computer-operated via industrial control systems. Should hackers penetrate these systems, they could destroy or shut down vital equipment in a matter of keystrokes. In December 2015, Russian hackers attacked two Ukrainian power companies, causing nearly a quarter-million people to lose power. Some speculate this attack was a practice run for future infrastructure attacks on the United States.To date, no attack has shut down U.S. facilities, but hackers have successfully penetrated U.S. dams’ defenses. In 2013, Iranian hackers breached a small, computer-operated dam in Rye Brook, New York; some speculate that the intended target was actually the much larger Arthur A. Bowman dam. That same year, Chinese hackers penetrated the U.S. Army Corps’ National Inventory of Dams, which contains sensitive information on dams’ vulnerabilities. Attacks come from close to home as well: A recent report from the Department of the Interior’s Inspector General revealed that poor practices with employee access and account management left the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation’s dam facilities exposed to insider attack.A 2015 report from Lloyd’s estimates that the economic costs of a hypothetical cyberattack on 50generation facilities in the northeastern United States would exceed 243 billion and could reach nearly 1 trillion. While power outages from a single large hydroelectric dam would not be as widespread, it could black out part of a large city, shutting off critical services like water treatment and hospitals. If the hack released water from the reservoir, the effects of unplanned flooding would be horrific.Protecting Dams From Natural and Human ThreatsFollowing the September 11 attacks, the United States launched the National Infrastructure Protection Plan, which includes interagency task forces and information-sharing mechanisms, such as Homeland Security’s Dams Portal. The plan’s counter-cyber operations complement FEMA’s National Dam Safety Program, which orchestrates regulation and best practices on dam design and risk management across several agencies. If they work together, these federal programs could help make U.S. dam infrastructure more resilient to both natural and human threats.Another critical step in protecting critical infrastructure is decommissioning old dams. The average age of a U.S. hydroelectric dam is 64 years, and many are classified as being high risk. Decommissioning aging, high-risk dams could help avert disaster–and has the additional benefits of improving ecosystems by allowing rivers to run freely and support the return of aquatic species and plants.Finally, we need to repair dams that can be fixed. As Puerto Rican communities struggle to recover from Hurricane Maria, the Guajataca Dam is patched and 114 displaced families are back in their homes. However, the dam has not been hardened against severe storms, and the U.S. Army Corps estimates that it will be working until July 2019 to stabilize the dam and spillway. It will take even longer before Guajataca is resilient to the ever-increasing extreme weather events that climate change has in store.Sources: Al Jazeera, American Society of Civil Engineers’ Infrastructure Report Card, Association of Dam Safety Officials, BBC, Engineering News Record – ENR Southeast, Encyclopedia Britannica, Free Beacon, The Hill, Houston Press, International Commission on Large Dams, Lloyd’s Emerging Risks Report, New York Times, New Yorker, Nextgov, Scientific American, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Energy Information Agency, U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency, University of California-Davis Watershed Information, Photo Credits: 1. The Kariba Dam, which generates hydro-electric power for Zambia and Zimbabwe, September 2010.

Michigan dams fail near Midland, causing ‘catastrophic’ flooding - The Washington Post Accessibility statementSkip to main contentSearch InputSearchMenuSectionsMenuSectionsDemocracy Dies in DarknessProfileSign inProfileSign inClockThis article was published more than 2 years agoThe Washington PostDemocracy Dies in DarknessCapital Weather GangMichigan dams fail near Midland; ‘catastrophic’ flooding underwayApproximately 10,000 people evacuated as waters surge to record levels.By Matthew Cappucci and Andrew Freedman May 20, 2020 at 8:17 p.m. EDTA dam in Edenville, Mich. collapsed on May 19 resulting in massive flooding across Midland County, Mich. (Video: The Washington Post)Placeholder while article actions loadUnprecedented flooding was ongoing Wednesday morning in Midland County, Mich., after a pair of dams collapsed following record rainfall. Thousands of residents have been told to evacuate as floodwaters gush into the communities along the Tittabawassee River, inundating homes and businesses and prompting an emergency declaration from Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D). The flooding is threatening a major Dow Chemical plant that lies along the river.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightChicago breaks May rainfall record for third year in a row as heavy rains soak MidwestThe Edenville Dam was breached Tuesday evening after Midland received 4.7 inches of rain in a 48-hour period, following days of heavy rain across the state. The dam sits about 18 miles upstream of Midland, a city of more than 40,000.That collapse sent floodwaters gushing into Sanford Lake, where a dam has powered the Boyce Hydroelectric Plant. The Sanford Dam succumbed shortly thereafter, the twin reservoirs of water left with no place to drain but into the city of Midland. A flash flood emergency is in effect for downstream areas of Sanford.According to the Associated Press, 10,000 residents have been evacuated.AdvertisementThe National Weather Service in Detroit issued a rare flash-flood emergency, the governor warning that downtown Midland could find itself under up to nine feet of water early Wednesday. News reports showed flooded Midland homes and businesses on Wednesday morning. The Weather Service bulletin described a “particularly dangerous situation” and “catastrophic” flood threat.“This is devastating,” said Whitmer on Wednesday, following an aerial tour of the damage. She said the flood severity is on the order of a 500-year event. A 500-year flood would have a 0.2 percent chance of occurring in any given year.“Right now, the water is rising, and we won’t know the extent of it for maybe the next 12, 15 hours,” said Whitmer at a news conference Tuesday evening.Scores of businesses have been shuttered in the fallout of the coronavirus pandemic, which has been particularly severe in Michigan, and are facing serious economic hardship.Advertisement“This is unlike anything we’ve ever seen before,” said Whitmer. “I feel like I’ve said that a lot over the last number of weeks, but this truly is a historic event that is playing out in the midst of another historic event.”Major flooding begins when the Tittabawassee River hits 28 feet; flood stage is at 24 feet. As of 8 p.m. on Wednesday evening, river gauges reported a level of 35.05 feet. That’s enough to flood West Main Street from Main Street to Saginaw Road, with many homes experiencing overland flooding. It’s also more than one foot above the previous record. It supersedes the historic 33.9-foot flood stage measured on Sept. 13, 1986, which at the time was deemed a “once in 500 year flood.” National Weather Service hydrologists were forecasting a crest four feet higher early Wednesday, though the river fell shy of that prediction. Dow Chemical Co.’s Midland headquarters was evacuated, with only essential staff remaining on-site to monitor the situation. The facility is associated with a Superfund site due to excess dioxins, which are known to cause cancer, in the riverbed downstream of the plant. New video released by the Michigan State Police showed flooding on the Dow property, though the extent and severity is unclear.AdvertisementAccording to a company statement issued Wednesday, at 10 a.m. they received word that “flood waters were commingling with on-site containment ponds.” Dow says it’s working with the Coast Guard and other officials to ensure the safety of the facility and community.“Dow has activated its local emergency operations center and is implementing its flood preparedness plan which includes the safe shutdown of operating units,” wrote the company on its Facebook page. Dow also filed an “Unusual Event Report” with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission because of the possibility that floodwaters could affect its 300 kilowatt nuclear research reactor, located at the plant, though the reactor was already shut down due to the coronavirus outbreak. That reactor was built in 1967.The flooding illustrates the challenge that natural disasters, worsened by climate change, poses for cleaning up Superfund and other hazardous waste sites in the country. A Government Accountability Office report released in 2019 found that “About 60 percent of Superfund sites overseen by EPA are in areas that may be impacted by wildfires and different types of flooding — natural hazards that may be exacerbated by climate change.”“This is a solidly middle to upper class town because of the Dow plant here,” Peter Sinclair, a Midland resident who is a videographer for Yale Climate Connections, said in an interview. He said a 2017 seasonal flood event, combined with this disaster, may cause property values to decline. This includes expensive lakefront property, since these lakes are now being drained by the flooding.Edenville dam’s previous owners were warned about safety issuesFor years, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has feared a failure at the Edenville Dam. According to The Detroit News, the dam has been of concern to federal overseers since at least 1999, when its owners were warned that more spillway capacity was needed to avoid a potential collapse.AdvertisementThe Edenville dam was constructed in 1924 and was on FERC’s list of “high hazard” dams, meaning that its failure could damage property and threaten lives.Boyce Hydro LLC, which has owned three other dams along the Tittabawassee River, failed to meet FERC demands for years.A January 17, 2019 FERC document notes “a history… of Boyce Hydro’s failure to comply with its license for the Edenville Project.”In January of this year, a two-county authority moved to purchase four dams and lakes from Boyce Hydro LLC, including Edenville and Sanford, for 9.4 million, and expects to spend 100 million to improve the dams. FERC had repeatedly faulted the previous owner for failing to maintain and improve spillways, which help direct excess water around the dam to relieve pressure on the structure.FERC argued that the Edenville dam “could not handle 50 percent of a probable maximum flood for the region,” the paper reported, whereas in 2018, Boyce Hydro put the odds of a “probable maximum flood” event occurring during the next 5 to 10 years at “5 to 10 in one million.”AdvertisementFERC revoked Boyce Hydro’s license on September 10, 2018, forcing the company to permanently disable its power generating capacity within the dam. The order, however, did not require Boyce to modify the dam’s structure. Boyce filed for a rehearing, which was denied on January 17, 2019.“This was a known problem for a while,” Whitmer said of the dams that failed. She said the state may pursue legal action to ensure the state is compensated for the damage.Sinclair, who is on the dry side of Midland and is sheltering family members who live closer to the flood-affected areas, says this event illustrates what climate scientists have been warning about for years.“[There is the] Larger issue of aging infrastructure plus incremental climate change, this is a point that all the scientists make that the change is gradual, gradual, gradual until the infrastructure fails.”Heavy rains are in line with recent climate change trendsHeavy spring rains triggered the disaster. Much of the Midwest has borne the brunt of a wet weather pattern that’s left many areas with an extra 8 to 10 inches of rain when compared to average.NEW VIDEO: Aerial footage shows level of flood damage in Mid-Michigan after dams breached: https://t.co/ZM0HKpYzcs pic.twitter.com/P0QNbfucwO— Local 4 WDIV Detroit (@Local4News) May 20, 2020 On Tuesday, Gladwin, Mich. picked up 2.53 inches of rain, while Central Michigan University in Mount Pleasant, about 25 miles west of the Edenville Dam, received 2.65 inches. Upwards of three inches fell upstream, pouring into a river that’s been already swollen in recent weeks.AdvertisementThe scene in Michigan after a pair of dams collapsed following record rainfallShareShareView PhotosView PhotosNext ImageMay 22, 2020 | Residents clean up debris in the aftermath of the Sanford Dam failure, which flooded the Tittabawassee River and parts of Sanford, Michigan. (Rebecca Cook/Reuters)Midland received 3.83 inches on Tuesday — its fourth-highest calendar-day rainfall total on record, and its wettest day since September 2015. Records date back to 1970.During the past several decades, spring rainfall in Michigan has been on the increase, likely tied to warming temperatures and the air’s ability to hold additional moisture. Data point to a roughly 25 percent increase in March through May rainfall since 1970 in Midland, with similar trends observed areawide. Mean springtime precipitation in Gladwin has leapt from 7.1 inches in 1940 to nearly 9.3 inches nowadays. Spring temperatures have warmed a degree and a half there during that same time frame.According to the U.S. government’s National Climate Assessment, the heaviest precipitation events in the Midwest have increased by 42 percent since 1958, which it attributed in large part to added heat and moisture from human-caused climate change.The last four years, 2016 through 2019, were all ranked among Michigan’s top 15 wettest on record, and five of the top 10 wettest years have come in the last decade.Comment CommentsGiftOutlineGift ArticleLoading...2022 Heat Tracker690-degree days so farAverage Year-To-Date10Yearly Average40Record Most67 (1980,2010)Record Fewest7 (1886,1905)Last Year48TOP STORIESThe Travel EnthusiastTravel news, guides and tips for anyone looking to get away.Gay happy hour, neutral pronouns, a ‘glam room’: Hotels go LGBTQ-friendlyEverything you need to know about traveling to GermanyThe real meaning behind Italians’ hand gesturesRefreshTry a different topicSign in or create a free account to save your preferencesTweets by @capitalweatherCompanyAbout The PostNewsroom Policies & StandardsDiversity and InclusionCareersMedia & Community RelationsWP Creative GroupAccessibility StatementGet The PostGift SubscriptionsMobile & AppsNewsletters & AlertsWashington Post LiveReprints & PermissionsPost StoreBooks & E-BooksNewspaper in EducationPrint Archives (Subscribers Only)e-ReplicaToday’s PaperPublic NoticesContact UsContact the NewsroomContact Customer CareContact the Opinions teamAdvertiseLicensing & SyndicationRequest a CorrectionSend a News TipReport a VulnerabilityTerms of UseDigital Products Terms of SalePrint Products Terms of SaleTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyCookie SettingsSubmissions & Discussion PolicyRSS Terms of ServiceAd Choiceswashingtonpost.com © 1996-2022 The Washington Postwashingtonpost.com© 1996-2022 The Washington PostAbout The PostContact the NewsroomContact Customer CareRequest a CorrectionSend a News TipReport a VulnerabilityDownload the Washington Post AppPolicies & StandardsTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyCookie SettingsPrint Products Terms of SaleDigital Products Terms of SaleSubmissions & Discussion PolicyRSS Terms of ServiceAd Choices

Email Twitter RSS FacebookMenu NatureRecreationHistoryARTSEnvironmentFood Adirondack ExplorerAdventure PlannerEmail NewsletterSunday, June 7, 2020Dam failure and implications for the Adirondacksby Ry Rivard5 CommentsRecent dam failures in Michigan are a reminder that humanity’s efforts to hold back rising water with aging infrastructure are not guaranteed to succeed.The Michigan case, where two dams on the same river failed, makes it hard to point fingers at a single problem. But it provides a particularly well-documented example of what happens when a privately owned dam isn’t maintained. In a blistering piece that appeared in Slate, a former native of Midland writes about the history and current owners of one of the failed dams. The full piece is worth reading because it shows how a private dam owner can avoid making upgrades until it’s too late.Regulatory failure is also usually a factor in dam failure: In Michigan, there are two dam safety staffers for the whole state and 2,500 dams, the Detroit Free Press reported. In New York, as of 2018, there were 11 staffers looking out for more than 5,800 dams. In a June 2018 report on dam safety in New York, the state comptroller found that while no New York dams are rated “unsafe,” most do not have a condition rating at all.There is also another rating for the hazard a dam poses if it fails — so the worst sort of dam is unsafe and high hazard.In and around the Adirondacks, there are at least 53 high hazard dams, based on data compiled by the comptroller’s office for Clinton, Essex, Franklin, Hamilton, Herkimer, St. Lawrence and Warren Counties. Of those, 20 are privately owned, three are owned by a public utility and the rest are owned, at least in part, by the state or local governments. High hazard is the state’s way of saying a dam’s failure will likely result in widespread or serious damage to homes, infrastructure or the environment in a way that costs lives or lots of money.According to the comptroller’s data, there weren’t condition ratings for 43 of those dams, five had no deficiencies and another five were considered “unsound.” The “unsound” rating applies to dams like the Penfield Dam in Ironville, which we wrote about a few months ago. It’s considered an intermediate hazard because it “may” rather than is “likely” to cause significant damage if it fails.Statewide, more than 200 locally owned dams would cost over 300 million to repair.Dams seem permanent, if they even get noticed, but recent history tells us how fragile they can be. Nine years ago, Hurricane Irene washed away the historic dam at Duck Hole and irrevocably damaged Marcy Dam, which the state then dismantled.The comptroller’s report notes that even relatively small incidents can have huge costs. As an example, it cites a dam on Hadlock Pond in the Town of Fort Ann that collapsed, even though it had been recently repaired. Homeowners had to be evacuated, homes flooded, a replacement dam cost millions and it took years in court to sort everything out.We’ll likely be taking a longer look at this in the future, but if there are particular dam safety issues that have come to your attention or that you’re curious about, drop me a line.Photo: the former Marcy Dam/Almanack archiveEditor’s note: This piece originally appeared in Ry’s weekly “Water Line” newsletter.

We should be systematically monitoring human-made dams across the state and country, and carefully removing those that are obsolete or dangerous. Where dam removal is feasible, it can reopen long stretches of river habitat for spawning fish and other aquatic wildlife. As well as being beneficial for wildlife and recreation, dam removal can become a jobs creation program.

The executive summary of Pebble’s preliminary final EIS — which was sent to some Bristol Bay-area Tribes as well as state and federal government organizations acting as “cooperating agencies” to provide input on the final document prior to its release — states that the modeling of an “extremely unlikely” tailings release was deemed inappropriate by the Corps due to Pebble’s use of a flow-through tailings dam design, which is fundamentally different than major tailings dams that have failed around the world in recent years. Pebble CEO Tom Collier said in a formal statement issued shortly after the typically confidential summary was released that criticism of the Corps’ review is rhetoric that ignores what happened during review of the draft EIS, which was published about a year ago. Pebble has interpreted the leaked summary as indicative of a favorable permitting conclusion for the project. “Just because some of the groups opposed to Pebble do not like the conclusions reached by the USACE (Corps) does not that the USACE’s work is not valid,” Collier said. “Rather, the USACE’s work on this issue is sound. It is defensible and it should be commended for its completeness.” Commercial fishing and conservation groups have criticized the entirety of the summary, and argue that the tailings dam issue is just another symptom of a rushed and incomplete EIS process. According to the summary, a not-yet-published appendix to the full, final EIS details the rationale behind the probability of a large-scale tailings dam release from the bulk tailings storage facility, or TSF. That appendix addresses several recent dam failures, such as those in Brazil and the 2014 Mount Polley dam failure in British Columbia, and discusses “the higher probability of failure of water-inundated tailings slurries behind upstream dams compared to drained, thickened tailings behind downstream/centerline dams.” Corps Alaska officials have said in prior interviews that a detailed analysis of the tailings facilities is outside the scope of their review, noting the State of Alaska is responsible for reviewing permitting for the specific tailings dams designs and construction through its Dam Safety Program administered by the Department of Natural Resources. Pebble has yet to apply for its state dam permits. The company plans to build a centerline-style dam for its bulk TSF that will allow water to pass through the dam and subsequently be collected below the embankment for storage and treatment before it is released back into the environment. Pebble Permitting Vice President James Fueg said the company specifically examined what has happened during TSF failures around the world while designing its facilities. “Everything we’ve done in our approach — not just to designing the tailings dams but into laying out the entire site and combining the tailings management systems and the water management system — was all done specifically to address things that led to the failures at Mount Polley and the failures in Brazil,” Fueg said. “It’s more than just saying, ‘This is how we’re going to design the tailings embankment;’ you’ve got to look at the whole project.” The January 2019 collapse of an iron ore mine tailings dam near the Brazil city of Brumadinho released a mass of tailings sludge and killed 270 people. It was preceded by another large-scale tailings dam failure in the country in 2015. Pebble leaders first point to the fact that they plan to build two, separate tailings facilities: one to store the benign waste rock that makes up the lion’s share of the finely ground mine waste, or tailings, and another that will hold the pyritic tailings, or those that can generate acid when exposed to air and water. The main bulk TSF dam will be 600 feet high and the pyritic tailings embankment will be approximately 250 feet high, according to Pebble’s permit application materials. Combined, the facilities will cover more than 3,800 acres. Fueg said the large, bulk TSF will hold 85 percent to 90 percent of the waste that is left over from the mining process and the focus there is simply building the most stable facility possible. Part of that is allowing water to flow through the dam itself, rather than allowing the water to build up behind the dam and become a static force that is constantly pushing on the upstream face of the dam, according to Fueg. Part of the problem at Mount Polley was that water breached the dam prior to its collapse; removing water helps stabilize the associated tailings. Separating the water and tailings reduces the already slim risk of a dam failure and also limits the impact if a failure does occur, he said. “If you take a glass that’s a mix of sand and water and pour it out over the table, what’s going to happen? That sand and water is going to run all over the table and drip over the edges. But if you take a glass of — whether it’s dry sand or damp sand — and you dump it on the table you’re going to end up with a pile of sand in the middle of the table and that’s what we’re trying to do with this concept,” Fueg described. Pebble’s pyritic, or potentially acid-generating waste rock will be stored in water behind a separate, downstream-style tailings dam in a lined-facility while the mine is active. The pyritic tailings will be moved from the storage facility and into the bottom of the roughly 1,500 feet deep mine pit at the end of the mine’s 20-year life. The pyritic tailings will again be covered with water as the pit naturally fills and will safely remain there after closure and reclamation, according to the company. Fueg said Pebble will be mining rock specifically for the tailings dams rather than utilizing tailings and waste rock to build the dams, as is often done at other mines. He added that the downstream slope of the bulk TSF will be very gradual, with a 2.6-to-1 slope. “Ours is a much flatter slope, which again increases stability and the factor of safety in the design,” Fueg said. Finally, Pebble will dig down to bedrock before building the dam to prevent a potential weak layer of soil from compromising the dam from below, as also happened at Mount Polley, Fueg said. The whole system hinges on the ability to treat lots of water in an already wet place, which Fueg acknowledged, but he said Pebble has designed its two large water treatment plants to handle the combination of a large storm during the peak of snow runoff in the midst of the wettest 20-year period in the 76 years of weather records available for the nearby Iliamna Airport. “Half of the overall (water management) capacity is simply there as a precaution to deal with flood events or a series of wet years. It’s a massive pond,” he said. Alaska Dam Safety Program Engineer Charlie Cobb declined to discuss the specifics of Pebble’s TSF designs because he could eventually be tasked with adjudicating them in the state’s permitting process. Cobb did note that Pebble’s tailings dams would be among the largest in the state. He said generally, though, that evaluating the failure risk of a given tailings dam against those that have failed is problematic because the design of each structure is extremely site and material specific. “The rates of failure in the tailings dam industry are based on a whole fruit basket of dams. When one goes bad now and then it’s like, ‘OK, what kind of fruit was that?’” Cobb said. More often, he said the failure risk is vetted through a Failure Modes and Effects Analysis by a group of engineers that search for weak spots in a design in a back-and-forth exercise until the design is sufficiently reinforced. However, Dave Chambers, an engineer and geophysicist who founded the Montana-based nonprofit Center for Science in Public Participation said Pebble’s tailings management plans were developed to save money and do not jive with the reality of the mine or the available mineral resource. Chambers counters the claim that the flow-through bulk TSF will reduce the risk of failure with the contention that allowing the dam to fill with water from the inside could actually add to the risk. “You don’t want the dam to ever become saturated. When you allow a dam to get saturated you can have static failures,” he said. According to Chambers, many modern tailings dams are built with a thick internal layer of clay or other impermeable material that prevents water flow. Instead, the water is directed to a drain at the toe of the dam and is subsequently routed to the water treatment pond. He said the flow-through design inherently allows some saturation of the dam material and while water is not supposed to build up behind the dam, it could and is a scenario that needs to be modeled. “To my mind, flow-through dams aren’t as safe as a more conventional flow-through dam with a barrier in it because that (barrier) gives you another check on controlling the saturation of the dam,” Chambers said. The company went with the flow-through design to avoid the added cost of designing and building the dam with the internal barrier, he argues. “A permeable dam is just adding basically a second drainage system that shouldn’t be required,” he said. Chambers is more concerned with the pyritic tailings plan, he said, despite the fact that the pyritic tailings dam will be built with a conventional downstream method that includes the impermeable internal layer he’s calling for in the bulk TSF. That’s because he doesn’t believe Pebble will ever end up dumping the pyritic tailings in the bottom of the pit. Doing so would preclude expansion of the mine beyond the current plan, which many observers believe is necessary to make the overall project economic. He called the proposal a “lawyer’s mine plan.” “The reason that won’t happen is that there’s 88 percent of that main resource sitting in the ground at the end of their 20-year mining life and if they backfill that (pyritic) material into the pit they sterilize that resource — that is, they can’t mine it until they take all that stuff out again, which is hugely expensive,” Chambers said. “I know that they’re not going to do it. They know they’re not going to do it. The investors know that they’re not going to do it, which is why they’re not complaining about the plan.” He expects Pebble to build a second, larger pyritic TSF once they move ahead with expanding the project. In response to the assertion that Pebble will expand the project, Pebble spokesman Mike Heatwole wrote that the current plan calls for putting the pyritic tailings back into the pit and the company believes that the proposal is a significant improvement to its closure plan. He noted that any further development plans would require a wholly new permitting process. Elwood Brehmer can be reached at [email protected].

And though the storm had long departed, the tragedy and hardship continued Friday when the National Weather Service warned that a key dam northwest of San Juan was in danger of failing.The National Weather Service in San Juan said the northwestern communities of Isabela, Quebradillas and the surrounding areas were in danger. The approximately 70,000 people who live in the area were warned to seek higher ground immediately, as the failure of the 345-yard dam threatened to create flash flooding downstream on the Rio Guajataca. A flash flood emergency warning remained in place for eastern Isabela and western Quebradillas and surrounding areas early Saturday.In the town of Toa Baja alone, eight people have drowned, the town's mayor Benardo "Betito" Marzquez told NBC News. The mayor confirmed that some 4,000 people have been rescued from flood waters, but the town 30 miles west of San Juan remains without power and cell phone communication and had yet to receive adequate amounts of relief supplies of food or potable water.Hurricane Ravaged Puerto Rico Begins Slow RecoverySept. 22, 201702:03Residents appear to be in a state of shock, even as waters have begun to recede. The National Guard is in the town, along with search and rescue teams from Virginia and Florida.On Friday the island's main newspaper, El Nuevo Día was reporting bridge collapses, overflowing rivers, evacuations and some landslides in parts of the island.Before Maria hit, Puerto Rico already was considered in crisis, hanging on by the fingertips to a cliff, but getting some gripping. Now some fear the hurricane has sent the island into free fall and they are wondering if there’s an adequate safety net to stop it.“This is a particularly devastating hurricane at a particularly weak moment,” Rep. Luis Gutiérrez said Thursday in a Chicago meeting with the city's Puerto Rican community, organized to help.Health and safety are always concerns after such a disaster, but Puerto Rico must try to address those with the island largely devoid of electrical power and with a severely damaged communication system.RELATED: Mainland Families Desperately Await Word from Puerto Rico "The infrastructure of Puerto Rico is so weak that it’s going to take a really long time (to recover). This is not like the electricity going out in the city of Chicago. The infrastructure has already been so debilitated and there have been so many years of lack of continuing support for that infrastructure," Gutiérrez said.Residents drive through a flooded road after the passing of Hurricane Maria on September 22, 2017 in Toa Baja, Puerto Rico. Carlos Giusti / APThere are immediate needs of making sure hospitals can continue to run on generators, which require fuel that is in demand. It's unknown how many people are trapped in homes that can’t get to a hospital or need some kind of health aid, such as a nebulizer, medication or assistance with getting around.“My mother-in-law is being taken care of at home. She needs care 24/7, including air conditioning. She’s bed-ridden and on oxygen. How long can you support gasoline generators? They have one, but they have to fill it every day,” said Edwin Melendez, the director of Center for Puerto Rican Studies, Hunter College, City University of New York. “It’s not like these things are gas free. How do you get the gas?”An older couple wait to be evacuated from their home by Emergency personnel in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria, in Toa Baja, Puerto Rico, 21 September 2017. EPA/Thais LlorcaThais Llorca / EPAJaime Pla, president of the Puerto Rico Hospital Association, told NBC News that hospitals have been able to operate normally for the past 48 hours because they have been on generator power.“The issue we’re going to have is accessibility to diesel,” said Pla, adding that most generators operate on diesel tanks that last between three to five days.Pla said that islanders who use medical equipment on a daily basis, but have no power, should first try to go to a nearby shelter that has electricity, noting that hospitals have been at capacity since before the storm. He added however that anyone who has a medical emergency should not hesitate to go to a hospital.A destroyed house lays flooded in Catano town, in Juana Matos, Puerto Rico, on September 21, 2017, following Hurricane Maria. / AFP PHOTO / HECTOR RETAMALHECTOR RETAMAL/AFP/Getty ImagesHECTOR RETAMAL / AFP - Getty ImagesPla said he was still concerned about islanders who were having trouble getting around. Downed trees and power lines have made roads impassable in places and there are concerns about rural regions and what effect the relentless rains had on dirt roads.“The hurricane has been nothing short of a major disaster,” Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló told MSNBC Friday.All of this comes after Puerto Rico's medical system already was strained as doctors have been leaving the island because of the economic crisis, as NBC News reported last month.RELATED: Puerto Ricans Venture Out to Face Hurricane Maria's Devastation Gutiérrez also noted that the island has a largely older population because many of its young people have left find work on the mainland.Caribbean News reported that the Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA, is flying in cargo planes loaded with water, food, generators and temporary shelters.Heartbreak in Puerto Rico: 'We Don't Have Anything'Sept. 22, 201701:27Mike Hyland, senior vice president of engineering services at the American Public Power Association based in Arlington, Va. said his organization was preparing to send a team into Puerto Rico when New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo offered to bring them in on the plane he’d chartered in New York.They accepted the offer, which allowed them to get the team in sooner than they thought they would.The team includes helicopters and drone pilots. The drones will be used to scan the countryside to help assess the damage. Hyland spoke more optimistically about prospects for restoring Puerto Rico’s electricity.“I would point to (Hurricane) Irma, how well Puerto Rico did … they were serving 96 percent in five or six days. To me that seems okay,” he said. But nothing will be certain until a damage assessment is complete. As soon as the team arrives, their task will be similar to surveying every electric system structure in the state of Connecticut, Hyland said.“Our job is to get the lights back on,” he said.Follow NBC Latino on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.Suzanne GamboaSuzanne Gamboa is a national reporter for NBC Latino and NBCNews.comGabe Gutierrez and Sandra Lilley contributed.AboutContactHelpCareersAd ChoicesPrivacy PolicyDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCA NoticeTerms of ServiceNBC News SitemapAdvertise© 2022 NBC UNIVERSALNBC News LogoMSNBC LogoToday Logo

By Aaron Kunkler • May 18, 2021 5:00 pm A inundation map outlining areas of King County which are likely to flood if the Tolt River Dam fails. This map was obtained through a records request made by the Snoqualmie Valley Record to Seattle Public Utilities. Ever since a false dam failure alarm sent Carnation residents scrambling for higher ground last July, city officials and residents have been asking Seattle Public Utilities for inundation maps. These maps show areas where water from the Tolt River dam would flood if the dam were to fail. This week, the King County Office of Emergency Management released a Google map showing a rough outline of areas that would be flooded, stretching from King County’s northern border down through Fall City. The dam itself is owned and operated by Seattle Public Utilities, and the utility company works with the county to create and implement emergency response plans. A screenshot of the inundation map released by King County that shows areas of the county which could be flooded if the Tolt River Dam failed. Through a records request filed with Seattle Public Utilities, this newspaper obtained two, more detailed maps, one of which is dated from April 2019, and can be seen at the top of this story. It shows when flood waters are expected to reach various communities throughout the Snoqualmie Valley. The map shows that flood waters would reach Carnation within an hour and a half, and spread south to Fall city in three hours and 20 minutes. To the north, it would reach Duvall within three hours, and continue further into Snohomish County. The second map, also discovered in the records request, shows inundation stretching deep into Snohomish County. Alex Chen, Seattle Public Utilities interim branch deputy director for drinking water, said they weren’t planning on releasing the map which shows estimated flood water arrival times. Chen said they’re concerned that such maps could give a false sense of security to residents, who if the dam failed, may believe they have a set amount of time left before they should evacuate. Chen stressed that the maps, and flood times, were only estimates using a number of assumptions about what a worst-case scenario may look like, and could vary significantly depending on a variety of factors. “We don’t want people to be relying on these estimated times to guide their response,” he said. Instead, both Seattle Public Utilities and King County’s emergency management hope people who receive alerts in the event of a dam failure will evacuate immediately. Chad Buechler, emergency management program leader with Seattle Public Utilities, said the message he wanted to convey was in the event of an emergency, grab loved ones, pets and a go-bag, and get out immediately. Carnation officials and Seattle Public Utilities said there are no concerns over the safety of the dam itself. The dam is monitored around the clock and receives daily inspections, and remains in compliance with federal regulations. For the Google map released by King County, a description states that the city of Seattle “cannot guarantee the accuracy of the information contained in this map. Each user of this map is responsible for determining its suitability for their intended use or purpose.” “In the event of an actual failure, the affected areas will depend on specific failure conditions and will likely differ from mapping shown,” the statement continues. The county released the Google map after Carnation officials and residents consistently requested them, said Carnation Mayor Kim Lisk. “That was one of our big pushes,” Lisk said. The records request filed by this newspaper shows that since at least July 2020, residents were asking for more information on inundation. One person requested “simple info that would let the residents know the danger zones.” In response, a civil engineer with Seattle Public Utilities wrote that the inundation route had been modeled as part of the Tolt Emergency Action Plan, but that these maps “contain references to critical infrastructure and are not typically released to the public.” But during an actual dam failure, people in the inundation zone need to know whether they’re at risk, and where to evacuate to, Lisk said. For people outside of the inundation zone, the best thing to do is to stay put and not add to traffic, Lisk said. But without detailed maps, it can be difficult for people to know whether they should stay or go. “To me, it’s like the more information, the better prepared you can be in an emergency,” Lisk said. Since July, Lisk said Seattle Public Utilities has been working more closely with the city and community, following the false alarm. Seattle Public Utilities stated in previous coverage that they are designing upgrades to the siren system. This includes ordering replacement sirens, starting design work and getting the necessary permits. They hope to get the needed federal permits by the end of this year, and the sirens should be installed in the first half of 2022. The alarm system failed to activate during regular weekly tests last year, and sent out a false alarm last July.

Below, a survey monument used to measure ground movement.Credit...Michal Czerwonka for The New York TimesBy Henry FountainFeb. 21, 2011LAKE ISABELLA, Calif.  Frank Brassell, owner of Nelda’s Diner in this town wedged between the slopes of the southern Sierra Nevada, knows his fate should Lake Isabella Dam, a mile up the road, suddenly fail when the lake is full.“I work here,” Mr. Brassell said, looking around the brightly lighted diner. “And I live right over there,” he added, pointing across the town’s main street.“The water would all come down here and it would try to take a right turn and go under the freeway, and it wouldn’t all go,” he said. “So I’m dead.”Lake Isabella Dam is just one acute example of a widespread problem: Of the nation’s 85,000 dams, more than 4,400 are considered susceptible to failure, according to the Association of State Dam Safety Officials. But repairing all those dams would cost billions of dollars, and it is far from clear who would provide all the money in a recessionary era.The stakes are particularly high not just for Mr. Brassell and the other 4,000 residents of Lake Isabella, but for the 340,000 people who live in Bakersfield, 40 miles down the Kern River Canyon on the edge of California’s vast agricultural heartland. The Army Corps of Engineers, which built and operates the 57-year-old dam, learned several years ago that it had three serious problems: it was in danger of eroding internally; water could flow over its top in the most extreme flood season; and a fault underneath it was not inactive after all but could produce a strong earthquake. In a worst case, a catastrophic failure could send as much as 180 billion gallons of water  along with mud, boulders, trees and other debris, including, presumably, the ruins of Nelda’s Diner  churning down the canyon and into Bakersfield. The floodwaters would turn the downtown and residential neighborhoods into a lake up to 30 feet deep and spread to industrial and agricultural areas.The potential is for a 21st-century version of the Johnstown Flood, a calamitous dam failure that killed more than 2,200 people in western Pennsylvania in 1889. But corps and local government officials say that the odds of such a disaster are extremely small, and that they have taken interim steps to reduce the risk, like preparing evacuation plans and limiting how much water can be stored behind the dam to less than two-thirds of the maximum.Still, they acknowledge that the impact of a dam failure would be enormous. “It’s not just the loss of life, potentially,” said David C. Serafini, lead technical expert for the corps on the project. “It’s the economic damages and the environmental damage, too.”Corps engineers are preparing to propose fixes later this year. But at best, repairs would not begin until 2014 and could cost 500 million or more, money that would have to be approved by Congress. Nationwide, the potential repair costs are staggering. A 2009 report by the state dam safety officials’ group put the cost of fixing the most critical dams  where failure could cause loss of life  at 16 billion over 12 years, with the total cost of rehabilitating all dams at 51 billion. But those figures do not include Lake Isabella and other dams among the approximately 3,000 that are owned by the federal government. The corps, for example, says that more than 300 of the roughly 700 dams it is responsible for need safety-related repairs, and estimates the total fix-up bill at about 20 billion.ImageCredit...Michal Czerwonka for The New York TimesThe corps has already spent about 24 million just to determine the scope of the problems at Lake Isabella, and with the New Orleans levee failures during Hurricane Katrina a lingering memory, Congress has appropriated money for other federal dam repair projects as well. But about two-thirds of all dams are private, and financially struggling state and local governments own most of the remainder. It is difficult to predict how needed repairs to these dams will be financed; legislation to provide federal money to help has languished in Congress. What’s more, the number of high-risk dams keeps rising as structures age, downstream development increases and more accurate information is obtained about watersheds and earthquake hazards.Among the corps’s dams, Lake Isabella is one of 12 that are ranked in the highest category, as a dam with serious problems and serious failure consequences, given the large downstream population. “The classification is it’s an unsafe dam,” said Eric C. Halpin, the corps’s special assistant for dam and levee safety. But Mr. Halpin noted that 319 of the corps’s dams were considered “actionable from a safety standpoint.” Lake Isabella would be one of the more expensive projects, but then again, its problems are legion. It is actually two earthen dams, a main one that is 185 feet high and an auxiliary one that sits on higher ground and is 100 feet high. With a rock ridge between them, they stretch for about a mile across the Kern River Valley.For six decades the dams have controlled flooding on the Kern, helping Bakersfield to grow and thrive. And the lake that formed behind the dam has become the main driver of the economy of Lake Isabella and other towns, bringing fishers, boaters and whitewater rafters to the area.But there have always been people in the area who felt the dams were flawed. David Laughing Horse Robinson, an artist and teacher who lives in the lakeside town of Kernville, said his grandfather, who worked on the dam, and others used to talk about it. “Constantly,” he said. “How it was the stupidest thing they ever did. It’s doomed.” Water seeps through the Lake Isabella dams, as it does through most earthen dams, which account for a vast majority of dams in the United States. But the seepage at Lake Isabella was especially severe  it is what prompted the corps to perform a full-scale study of the dam.Water seeping through a dam can erode it from the inside out, to the point where the dam may fail. Engineers have learned to build structures into dams like drains and filters, to stop erosion and allow infiltrating water to drain safely away. But the Lake Isabella dams were constructed before such features became commonplace. “It was built with the best available knowledge and technology at the time,” said Veronica V. Petrovsky, who is managing the project for the corps.That knowledge, or lack of it, extended to the understanding of the large and complex watershed, which includes the slopes of Mount Whitney, the tallest peak in the contiguous United States. To determine how big the spillway needs to be, it is critical to know how much water might be impounded behind the dam each year.ImageTOO CLOSE? Frank Brassell, owns Nelda’s Diner in Lake Isabella, Calif. Nelda’s is named for Mr. Brassell’s mother and is located a mile from the dam.Credit...Michal Czerwonka for The New York TimesCalculations show that in an extreme year with a “probable maximum flood,” the spillway would be far too small. “We could not release the water fast enough,” Ms. Petrovsky said. “It would overtop.” An overtopped dam can fail quickly as the water erodes the downstream side.Concerns about seepage, in particular, prompted the corps to restrict the lake level, because less water creates less hydrostatic pressure that would force water through the dam. Earlier this winter, the lake was so low that water did not even lap up against the auxiliary dam. But the corps has been monitoring the heavy rains and snowfall that California has experienced this winter and says that in the spring and summer it may be necessary to divert water through the spillway to maintain the safer lake level. Overtopping, however, presents only a “small concern,” the corps said.With both seepage and overtopping there would be plenty of warning that the dam was in jeopardy, allowing Lake Isabella and Bakersfield residents to evacuate. An earthquake would be a more immediate disaster, although Bakersfield would still have about seven hours before a wall of water made its way down the canyon, according to the corps. The auxiliary dam was built, knowingly, on the Kern Canyon fault, one of many in the region. At the time the corps brought in seismologists and geologists who concluded that the fault was not active. Only recently have scientists been able to accurately detect and measure ancient earthquakes, a field known as paleoseismology. Mr. Serafini and others determined that there have been three significant earthquakes on the fault in the past 10,000 years. “We have got a fairly active fault on our hands,” Mr. Serafini said. The last quake occurred about 3,400 years ago, he added.It’s possible to construct a safe earthen dam on an active earthquake fault, by using the proper materials to minimize settlement or slumping when shaken, and including drains and filters to help stop the inevitable cracks from growing through erosion. Not only do the Lake Isabella dams lack those features, but the auxiliary dam was built on sediments that could turn into a virtual liquid in a quake, leading to even greater damage.While Mr. Serafini and his team are still working on proposals, the likeliest solutions include blasting a much bigger spillway out of bedrock adjacent to the main dam and using the excavated rock to build a buttress  essentially an entirely new dam  downstream from the auxiliary dam. The old dam could still move in an earthquake, Mr. Serafini said, but the buttress would have the necessary drains and filters to prevent failure.While the proposals are being fleshed out, the corps team has been holding meetings in the area to let people know what the possibilities are.“We don’t hear much from the people of Bakersfield,” Ms. Petrovsky said. “It’s one of those ‘out of sight, out of mind’ things. You forget there’s a dam up here holding back a lot of water.”Not so in Lake Isabella, however, where the dam, and its potential for failure, are harder to ignore. “I think we’ve all put some thought into it,” said Mr. Brassell, the diner owner. “But anytime you have a diverse group of people there are going to be those who are panicked at some level, and those who are calm. Faith in God, you know. He’s going to do what he wants.”AdvertisementContinue reading the main storySite Information Navigation© 2022 The New York Times CompanyNYTCoContact UsAccessibilityWork with usAdvertiseT Brand StudioYour Ad ChoicesPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleSite MapCanadaInternationalHelpSubscriptions

Tragedy followed.Share This: Share this article on Twitter Share this article on Facebook Share this article via email Print this article Donate In 2006, the clock was bearing down on Lee Mueller’s family.Heirs of the founder of the Boy Scouts of America, Mueller and his relatives needed to reinvest money from the sale of an Illinois property in less than a year — or pay 600,000 in taxes to the IRS.Eventually, a solution came to Mueller, an architect who lives in Las Vegas, and his cousin, Michel d’Avenas, a California musician who is the son of a French count and is now known as the Pebble Beach Bagpiper.They would avoid taxes by purchasing four small hydroelectric dams in mid-Michigan near Midland, according to hundreds of pages of federal court records reviewed by Bridge.The deal was troubled from the start for trustees of the William D. Boyce Trusts, which manages the fortune of a Chicago publishing magnate who founded the Scouts at the dawn of the 20th century. In the 14 years that have followed, Mueller and the trust have clashed repeatedly with state officials, federal regulators, local homeowners and even fishermen. The source of friction: money, according to neighbors and court records.Mueller “hates government, he hates paying taxes, and nothing makes him happier than when he can stick his finger in the eye of government,” said Joe Manelis, a longtime Sanford Lake homeowner who has clashed with Mueller over one of the dams on his lake.Last week, after Boyce Hydro Power LLC, as well as prior owners, failed for decades to heed demands of federal regulators to increase flood capacity at the largest of the four dams, the Edenville Dam failed, sending billions of gallons downstream, destroying homes, property and prompting the evacuation of some 10,000 residents of Midland, Gladwin and Saginaw counties.Related: Gov. Gretchen Whitmer launches investigation into Midland dam failures​Related: Mid-Michigan dam that failed was cited for years for safety violationsRelated: Michigan regulators moved fast on dangerous dam. To protect mussels.Relate: Michigan GOP calls for Nessel to step down from investigation into dam failureThe flood came 1½ years after federal regulators terminated Boyce Hydro’s license to generate power at the Edenville Dam, citing decades of failures to fix spillways that can prevent flooding.Mueller’s attorney, Lawrence Kogan of New York, said his client wanted to make repairs but didn’t have the money. Mueller is devastated by the flood, Kogan said.“Of course, the man hasn’t slept,” Kogan said. “He feels terrible about all this.”Court papers indicate the Boyce Trust said the dams have lost money every year since at least 2016.Residents who live on lakes surrounding the dams are dubious about the pleas of poverty and accuse Mueller and the Boyce Trust of being absentee owners who for years didn’t invest in repairs.“He was a ‘teller’ and a ‘seller,’” said Jan Colton, a Wixom Lake resident, adding that Mueller tells people what to do and sells them on the idea that they should pay for it.‘He keeps us all in the dark’Money used to buy the Midland dams came not from Mueller nor d’Avenas, but from trusts set up in the 1920s by their multimillionaire ancestor. William D. Boyce was a tycoon who made his fortune on local newspapers and had a soft spot for adventure and progressive causes like labor unions. He later founded the Boy Scouts of America, now known as Scouts BSA, whose mission is to prepare youths to “make ethical and moral choices over their lifetimes.”When he died in 1929, Boyce’s estate was worth 20 million, according to one biography, the equivalent of 300 million today. It was divided into a series of trusts that descendents Mueller and d’Avenas eventually led.Mueller, described in press reports as a grandson, backs conservative causes and once listed his occupation in a campaign donation as a “spark of freedom.” D’Avenas is a great-grandson whose father was a French royal. He split his time as a child between France and Carmel, California, in a beachfront home later bought by actor Gene Hackman. “I’m just a plain old count. I don’t take too much stock in that stuff,” d’Avenas told Bridge. By 2005, when Mueller and d’Avenas controlled the trust, they found themselves in a time crunch.That September, Boyce Trusts sold a property in Illinois with the intention of buying a new one to avoid paying taxes on the sale, according to a lawsuit Mueller and d’Avenas filed in 2007. Under federal tax code, owners of investment properties can defer paying capital gains tax on their properties when they sell them if they buy similar ones in a certain period. The cousins had 45 days to find alternative sites and six months to buy one, or they risked having to pay  more than 600,000 in capital gains taxes. Mueller and his associates identified the four Midland dams and buildings in Indianapolis and Houston as options, and bought the dams in 2006 after borrowing money to complete the purchase.Mueller “spearheaded using the trust money to go after the dams in Michigan,” d’Avenas told Bridge.D’Avenas described himself as a hands-off trustee who left daily operations to his cousin Mueller and resigned from the trust a few years after the sale. A fixture in Monterey Bay, California, d’Avenas has been a professional bagpiper for more than 40 years and told Bridge he lost track of the Boyce family interests years ago.He said he didn’t know about the floods until a Bridge reporter told him of them Tuesday night.Mueller “doesn’t tell us anything. He keeps us all in the dark. … I don’t know what to say. I guess I can understand why he kept us all in the dark,” d’Avenas said. “He was responsible for all of that.”The purchase of the dams for 4.8 million prompted a mess of litigation that began just before the deal was finalized.On almost the last day before the tax deadline, the two men who helped broker the deal added new stipulations, the Boyce Trusts allege in court records.Because the trusts could not afford the entire purchase price, they borrowed about half from a California man, R.L. Milsner, who then sought payments of 150,000 a year until the loan was repaid, records show.Another man, Scott Goodwin, who was hired as co-manager of the dams, got provisions giving him substantial control of the companies. Goodwin, who had run other hydroelectric dams, helped persuade Mueller to buy the mid-Michigan properties in the first place, according to the 2007 lawsuit.The relationship between the trusts and Milsner and Goodwin deteriorated quickly, with accusations between the sides that spilled into lawsuits in Gladwin County and federal court. The trusts also battled the law firm that negotiated the deal in court for nearly a decade over legal fees.D’Avenas resigned from the trust a few years after the sale.“I just said I’m tired of this stuff,” said d’Avenas, who declined to elaborate.“So then someone else is gonna do it. I just didn’t want to do it anymore.” Problematic damsThe dams came with their own challenges. Since 1993, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission had told Boyce and previous owners that Edenville Dam didn’t meet design standards and was in danger of failing during a heavy rainstorm.FERC found the dam could drain only about half of expected “probable maximum flood,” — the amount of water expected only in the most severe weather — but the agency’s regulations require it to be able to pass the full maximum flood.FERC directed Boyce to build new spillways that could accommodate worse flooding, but for more than a decade, Boyce failed to complete the project and claimed it lacked the money to do so. In a June 2017 compliance order, FERC commissioners warned that failing to fix the spillways could endanger human life. The company’s “disregard for the severity of this situation is appalling,” the commissioners wrote.In 2018, FERC revoked Boyce’s license to generate power at Edenville. Kogan, Boyce’s attorney, pointed out that FERC had asked two previous owners to also add extra spillway capacity. “And none of them were able to do it,” Kogan said Tuesday. “You cannot look at the economics of this in a vacuum.”The Edenville dam generated about 1 million in annual revenue, according to court papers, while three smaller ones nearby generated another 900,000. Expenses were 1.2 million or less, records show.Boyce Hydro has lost 6,000 a day since the license was revoked, according to court papers.In court papers, the company wrote it planned to put revenue from the Edenville Dam in an escrow account to finance the spillway improvements. “The absurdity of the requirement that … [Boyce Hydro] cease generating electricity at Edenville is that the same water that would be used to generate electricity must instead be wasted over the spillway for reasons having nothing to do with dam safety,” according to a federal suit opposing the revocation.“The sustained cessation of generation … in the long term will increase the potential for flood damage.”Many run-insAlthough he lived in Nevada, Mueller made his presence known in Michigan, often feuding with cottages along Wixom and Sanford lakes over water levels.In 2013, local television stations reported that he faced charges on claims of ramming his car into a pick-up truck filled with people who had parked on his property to fish. The next year, he was accused of using a heavy chain to smash in the car windows of two others who fished by the dam. Both cases were charged as felonies and reportedly pleaded down to misdemeanors, according to news reports.Mueller and Boyce also clashed with state regulators who demanded he improve recreation opportunities near his dams, according to court records and lawsuits. As part of license agreements, the companies were supposed to build a recreation area including a parking lot, fishing pier, canoe portages and access paths.By 2015, state inspectors found Boyce Hydro not only hadn’t followed the agreed-upon plan, the company had set up fencing and barbed wire to prevent public access, records show.Two years later, the Michigan Department of Natural Resources determined access was still limited.Boyce Hydro also fell behind on property taxes on land underlying Sanford Lake, a 1,489-acre reservoir behind Sanford Dam that is among the four Michigan dam properties Boyce Hydro purchased in 2006.By the time Midland County foreclosed on the Sanford lakebottom properties in March 2010, Mueller’s company had racked up more than 30,000 in unpaid taxes, according to news reports from that time. In total, the county foreclosed on 27 parcels.Mueller said at the time he had intentionally not paid his taxes, telling MLive the county’s property records were “greatly and massively flawed.”Kogan contended the dams never earned enough from selling electricity to Consumers Power to cover all the expenses, including the Sanford Lake upgrades, taxes and the major repairs needed at Edenville. Private owners, public troubleBoyce Hydro’s clashes with government authorities and nearby communities highlight one of the liabilities of owning critical infrastructure as a private investment, said Jeremy Bricker, a civil engineering professor at the University of Michigan and Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands. There are almost 2,600 dams in Michigan, about three-quarters of which are privately owned, according to the American Society of Civil Engineers. When the country’s old hydroelectric dams were first built, they required little maintenance and generated sizable profits, Bricker said. But as those dams have aged, their maintenance needs have increased while profits from selling electricity have decreased. If private owners are unwilling or unable to conduct needed repair and maintenance, as Bricker said “is probably going to be the case with many dams,” the public bears the risk of the owner’s disinvestment.That’s what happened at Sanford Lake. Losing the lakebottom to foreclosure created a new problem for Mueller. The Sanford Dam’s FERC license required the company to control the bottomlands.In April 2010, FERC sent Mueller a letter threatening fines and possible license revocation if he failed to regain control of the properties, either by purchasing them back or obtaining an easement to use them. The letter prompted years of wrangling between Boyce, Midland County and lakeshore residents as they sought a solution to the bottomlands issue.Meanwhile, new conflicts arose between Mueller and area landowners.In August 2010, Boyce began draining the lake to conduct dam repairs without first warning lakefront homeowners, said Manelis, the property owner. Homeowners had to scramble to remove boats from the water before they became stranded. By spring, Mueller claimed he couldn’t refill Sanford Lake without more than 80,000 to complete the repairs. If area landowners didn’t foot the bill, Mueller said, he would permanently drain the lake. Landowners were left with the feeling that their lake levels were being held hostage for money. “This is a guy who has a multimillion-dollar corporation,” said Manelis. “That money should be in his petty cash drawer.”Local residents ultimately formed a group called the Sanford Lake Preservation Association, and paid for the repairs themselves. After Mueller refused for several more years to comply with FERC orders to maintain his dams, some of those same property owners helped form a local task force that planned to buy the properties from Mueller for 9.4 million — almost double what the Boyce trusts paid in 2006. The Four Lakes Task Force hoped to tax nearby residents to pay for repairs, and operate the dams for the enjoyment of communities who use the reservoirs.But before the sale could go through, last week’s rain fell and Edenville failed. Now, the task force is reassessing its plans.In a statement released Tuesday, task force president Dave Kepler said the organization “is dedicated to returning these lakes to a recreational and natural resource gem of the region.”“We will do this,” Kepler said, “with a continued focus on public safety.”In California, d’Avenas said he’s just catching up with the tragedy that followed his family’s investment.“At least we know now what has been going on.  Lee has kept us all in the dark,” he wrote to Bridge in an email. “So sorry for all those poor people that were affected by all of this. Thank God my mother is not alive to hear about it.”— Joel Kurth contributed to this report.

Dozens of boats are left stranded on their lifts. “There's dirt too far and there's no way to get the boat in the water, so it'll probably sit there for two or three years,” Rein said.  Wildlife left rotting in the hot sun. “There's a lot of death down there; dead fish, dead turtles,” Cox said.  People are wondering what problems the lack of water could bring next.  “Where the concern is, is on the walls. Because the water holds the walls up and, after a period of time, the walls start caving in and that's what's really going to be the big problem,” said Rein.  The dam failure couldn't have happened at a worse time. Memorial Day weekend is one of the busiest for visitors at Lake Dunlap. “Many, many boats, jet skis, a lot of tubers, and a lot of boats towing tubes and watercrafts,” Rein said.  “They're going to go elsewhere. They're going to go to other lakes. They're going to have to go to Canyon Lake, I guess, because I'm not sure where else they can go. So, yeah, we're going to lose a lot of business in town from this,” said Cox. Unfortunately, the problems at Lake Dunlap are far from over. Neighbors have been told it could take years for the dam to be repaired and water levels to return to normal.  “The value of our property's going way down I believe,” Rein said.  “They've already dropped. As soon as that water was gone, and the talk of them not fixing it for years, property values dropped tremendously here,” said Cox.  The Guadalupe Blanco River Authority said repairing the dam will cost between 15 and 35 million. --- RELATED Lake Dunlap spillgate collapse causes problems for City of Kyle’s water supply Dunlap Dam experiences spillgate failure DAILY NEWSLETTER All the news you need to know, every day By clicking Sign Up, I confirmthat I have read and agreeto the Privacy Policy and Terms of Service.

Mitchell Ourso Jr. believed the bayou would overflow as it did during a similar flood in 2016."It would be catastrophic to our residents in Iberville Parish," Ourso told WAFB. "I think we have around a half-dozen homes in our Bayou Paul area that's already inundated with water and with this water coming across this road would only worsen the situation."The aqua dam has been a point of contention between Iberville Parish and East Baton Rouge since 2016. East Baton Rouge is concerned it will cause flooding for its residents, while Iberville argues it needs to inflate them to stop water from East Baton Rouge from flooding its residents. Areas of Louisiana have experienced massive flooding due to heavy rainfall this week. Above, flood waters cover a roadway near structures damaged by Hurricane Laura on October 10, 2020 in Cameron, Louisiana. Mario Tama/Getty Images A Baton Rouge judge signed a temporary restraining order to stop Ourso from inflating aqua dams, WARZ, a local ABC affiliate, reported Thursday."Stay in your lane," Ourso said during a meeting he was summoned to with Governor John Bel Edwards. "Stay in your lane. I don't tell you how to govern East Baton Rouge. Don't tell me how to govern Iberville Parish."According to WBRZ, there is a hearing over the aqua dam scheduled for Monday.Residents around Bayou Pigeon have raised concerns about flooding in their homes. Despite their requests to parish and state officials, no sufficient measures have been taken."They've been talking 20 years about putting a pump station up there at the locks to pump the water back into the spillway and you wouldn't have this, but nothing is getting done," resident Brian Vaughn told WAFB. "This is the second time I've sandbagged my house and I've been in this house for 10, 15 years."I'm fighting Mother Nature and it shouldn't be that way."

Jaymie Baxley/The Pilot Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Copy article link Save The perennially troubled Woodlake Dam in Vass came perilously close to breach levels Monday night after being inundated with rainwater from Hurricane Matthew.The dam looked stable up until early Monday evening when engineers noticed what appeared to be erosion in the center of the spillway. Normally, a dam spillway allows for the controlled release of water from a lake. After a massive rain event like this past weekend, that water release is essential to prevent the lake from overflowing or collapsing the dam itself.Erosion of the spillway is extremely concerning, however, and so Moore County Public Safety issued evacuation orders downstream of Woodlake on Sunday and then again Monday evening around 7:30 p.m. Residents were evacuated from Morrison Bridge Road to Riverbend Drive as a precaution against the dam’s failure, which could have posed “an extraordinary threat to life or property,” according to a news release from Moore County Emergency Management.That evacuation included homes along 55 roads in that area, which is largely bisected by N.C. 690. Homes along major roads like McPherson, Marks and McGill Road were evacuated along with homes along small lanes likes Eddie, Fernandez and Lothian. That area is threaded with creeks that feed Little River and points further east. Flooding forced Woodlake residents to evacuate the gated community. Jaymie Baxley Bridgette Munger, spokeswoman for the state division of Energy, Mineral and Land Resources, said Tuesday that the front of the dam had suffered damage from the storm. Engineers were able to stabilize the structure by lowering hundreds of sandbags into the dam, she said.“It is no longer considered an imminent failure, but it is still a serious situation,” Munger said. “People should not ignore evacuation directions.”A number of the endangered homes are along or near Little River, which swelled beyond flood stage because of more than 10 inches of rain.Volunteers from Crain's Creek Fire Department assisted people who were stuck downstream of the dam, along McGill Road and the flood-prone Riverview and Riverbend communities. The National Guard airlifted eight residents from two waterlogged properties.Eyvette Conklin reluctantly abandoned her home in Riverview Acres, but her husband decided to stay behind. She said that waist-deep floodwaters have damaged the couple’s car, their garage and the underpinning of their home.“It’s terrible out there,” Conklin said. “I have never seen it this bad.”Emergency officials said 78 residents had refused to leave the flooded area as of Wednesday morning. An aerial view of a flooded neighborhood in Woodlake Country Club. Photo courtesy Moore County Public Safety People across Moore County began panicking when they heard incorrect reports that a breach of the dam had occurred. Officials, however, were quick to caution the dam had not breached. Joe Mancos, assistant chief of Emergency Medical Services for Moore County Public Safety, said Monday night that a small portion of the dam had washed away but that engineers were working to “mitigate” the issue.Woodlake was once touted as the largest man-made lake in North Carolina. Its dam has been marred by structural deficiencies since the 1980s, when a crew drained the lake to repair a series of large holes. Subsequent repairs have been delayed and dragged out for years. Issues listed in the latest dam safety order include  “cracks in the principal spillway of the dam, a void of unknown size at the bottom of that spillway, voids along the sides of the dam’s wing wall and seepage at various locations on the downstream slope of the dam.” Nick Picerno, left, chairman of the Moore County Board of Directors, and Wayne Vest, the county manager, hold a press conference at Cypress Pointe Fire Department. Jaymie Baxley The lake’s location led the dam to be labeled a “high hazard” by the state Department of Environmental Natural Resources. High-hazard dams pose “a major threat to human life, local roads and property downstream,” according to the department. Munger says the Federal Emergency Management Agency has agreed to provide the state’s Dam Safety team with industrial-sized pumps to lower the lake’s water level. She added that state officials will remain on site “for the foreseeable future” to offer guidance and ensure the dam remains in stable condition.Nick Picerno, chairman of the Moore County Board of Commissioners, stressed that officials aren't taking any chances on the dam's stability.“At this time the prudent thing is not to let people in that area,” Picerno said during a press conference Tuesday at Cypress Pointe Fire Department. “The last thing we want to do is let people back in and this thing crack open.”He went on to commend the “superheroes” working to prevent the dam’s collapse.“If that dam gave away, they’re gone,” he said. “They’re risking their life to get this thing done.”Picerno said Wednesday that the lake's water level may drop enough by Monday to lift the evacuation order. Engineers are using auxiliary pumps to decrease the 222-foot water level to a desired 218 feet."We’re working really hard to get it to that point so we can get you home," he said. "Your safety is our primary concern."There was additional erosion in the dam Wednesday morning, according to Picerno.“The threat is real," he said. "Why it seems to be getting better is because we’re getting that lake level down.”Moore County Sheriff Neil Godfrey said that some residents have been escorted back to the evacuation zone to "pick up medication and things of that nature." Sheriff's deputies have been patrolling the area to prevent "looting and vandalism," he said.Moore County Schools has established temporary bus stops for students who live in the Woodlake community, as well as communities south and east of Woodlake. The bus stops are located at Neighbor’s Country Store in Vass and at Cypress Presbyterian Church in Cameron.Schools will operate on a two-hour delay for all students and staff on Thursday and Friday.

WBTV has learned there was a risk of a much bigger problem. A possible failure of the Oxford Dam holding back the waters of Lake Hickory.Over a 72 hour period starting May 3rd the headwaters of the Catawba River were hit with up to 11 inches of rain. It was much more than forecasters expected. The runoff down the mountains was pushed Lakes James and Rhodhiss higher.  Duke Energy, which controls the water levels through a series of dams, made the decision to raise a gate on the next lake in the chain, Lake Hickory.The gate was raised 3 feet around 6:30 p.m. on Sunday May 5th.  Property owners downstream on Lookout Shoals Lake were notified by Duke Energy their lake would rise to just over full pond. It was expected to reach 101.5 feet of elevation.As the evening moved along, it was clear one gate at 3 feet, wasn't enough. Oxford Dam was going to have to opened wider to handle the water still coming downstream.It is when the problem hit. The gate wouldn't budge. Duke Energy couldn't open it anymore."The hoist that is used to move that gate didn't function the way it should have," said Duke Energy Spokesperson Paige Sheehan. "They quickly brought in troubleshooters."It was 7 a.m., Monday May 6th, and Lake Hickory was nearing full pond. Just an hour later at 8 a.m. it reached it. Water began spilling over the dam and down the auxiliary spillway.How serious was the problem?"The operation of the system was all perfectly safe," said Sheehan.But three years ago, when WBTV investigated high water on Lookout Shoals, Duke Engineer George Galleher told us water topping at Oxford was not an option."We won't allow Lake Hickory, or Oxford Hydro to go over a hundred (feet)," said Galleher. "We raise the gates."It was a safety issue. A person has to get on the dam to hook the gate. They can't do it if water is going over top.  Thankfully, Duke had hooks on the one gate partially open.The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) said in a letter explaining the 2010 flooding on Lookout Shoals that if the lake tops 100 feet "before the spillway gates were opened, the inability to lift spillway gates...could potentially result in a dam safety emergency."But even knowing that, Wayne King, regional engineer for FERC tells WBTV the condition at Oxford was "serious.""(Duke) had one gate partially open with no control," said King.WBTV asked Duke's Sheehan why there appears to be a disconnect between what Duke was saying about the problem and what King had said."What I said was we had an operational challenge for a period of time that we were able to effectively address," said Sheehan.It was serious enough that Duke contacted FERC right away Monday morning.  Twenty minutes later the company called again. Duke told King it may have to go to "Condition B" at the dam.   A rare declaration that would signal a higher level of alert to local emergency managers.According to Duke's Emergency Action Plan the condition meant a "potentially hazardous situation is developing - there is no failure."FERC says it is a situation "where a failure may eventually occur."  It "should convey the impression that some amount of time is available...before failure of the dam is considered a foregone conclusion."The issue facing Duke was the water upstream was still rising and the gate was still stuck.  Lake James which dwarfs Lake Hickory was still at least 12 hours away from cresting.It raised another question, did the problem at Oxford affect Duke's ability to minimize the impact downstream?"Absolutely not," said Sheehan. "Downstream impact was minimal."The gate was finally fixed around 10 a.m. Three hours after the problem was identified, but Lake Hickory continued to rise. The lake would eventually hit 101.7 feet. The highest the lake had been in more than 70 years.  The decision was made to fully open two more gates. The water rush was on.Sheehan maintains the data shows there was minimal impact downstream. The fact is Lookout Shoals lake went from full pond to seven feet over in just six hours.  Homes were flooded, docks were submerged, boats and furniture were swept away.And the crisis wasn't over. The water still needed to get through Lakes Norman and Mountain Island. Duke put out a notice on its website Monday afternoon at 2:30 p.m. Mountain Island was expected to remain "at or below 102.5."  It also proved to be wishful thinking."They (Duke Energy) were terrible 9 years ago," said property owner Barry Stubbs. "And they were terrible this time letting us know how high the water was going to go."Overnight, at 1:20 a.m. new messages went out. The lake was now expected to "remain below 105 feet." A level of moderate flooding, but not everyone got the message.Flood waters arrived by dawn.  Cathy LaRoche is the Mountain Island Lake Commissioner. She strapped on a life jacket to save what she could from her dock."It came up a lot faster than I expected it really did," said LaRoche.At 6:55 a.m. the Charlotte Fire Department sent out a Tweet saying voluntary evacuations were underway. Yet, a flood warning from the National Weather Service wouldn't come for three more hours. It was finally issued at 9:59 a.m."You're right that came late. I don't know quite why that was," said LaRoche.The National Weather Service doesn't forecast for the Catawba River, because it says Duke controls the variables like how much water is being released down river.The Weather Service, however, will issue warnings based on data Duke provides. In this case, forecasters told WBTV the information was slow in coming."I am very confident that Duke Energy provided information to the National Weather Service that they needed to put out appropriate information to the public," said Sheehan.After our interview with Duke Energy, the company called the National Weather Service.  One of the forecasters we talked to earlier, who said information was slow in coming in, then called us. Now, we were told the NWS has a great relationship with Duke and forecasters can get all the information it needs.If so, why was the flood warning so late in coming out? We were told river statements had been issued for the expected high water along the middle Catawba River. The problem with those, they don't set off weather alarms and don't get crawled on the bottom to TV screens.FERC has already been in contact with Duke Energy. Regulator want a full "after action report." It must be filed by Duke by mid-June.Copyright 2013 WBTV.

"The lake is our daily income for all the visitors to come."In 2003, the old earthen dam gave way, giving Donna Gray, owner of Big T’s snack bar on the lake, six waterless summers. After delays and cost overruns, the new dam was finally ready in time for last summer.The town was still paying off the 14 million cost of building and maintaining the newer dam when the latest leak was discovered.“I just look at the lake and I cannot believe it,” Gray said. “I just cannot believe that a 14 million structure in 15 months is gone."Without water in the lake, Gray has seen her business dry up."You know, this is like a big death in the family to the whole community,” Dees said. “And we're not going to waste any time. We're going to get started right away trying to find out what happened and how we're going to fix it."Gray is cautiously optimistic that town leaders can resurrect the lake a second time.“It's just a little bit harder this time to believe we've got to go through this again, but we're gonna make it," she said.SUGGEST A CORRECTION More On This Town leaders to discuss solutions for Hope Mills LakeHope Mills Lake drained because of sinkholeOfficials to discuss solutions for Hope Mills LakeHope Mills lake drainedWeb only: Officials give update on Hope Mills Lake07/03/09: Holiday revelers return to Hope Mills Lake11/11/08: Water drains from Hope Mills Lake again08/29/08: Watershed event: Hope Mills Lake full after five yearsMapshow all Credits Reporters Dan Bowens Bryan Mims Photographer Michael Joyner Web Editors Kathy Hanrahan Jodi Leese Glusco Copyright 2011 by Capitol Broadcasting Company.

When they work, they're an integral part of making economies go, but when they fail there are devastating consequences.The historic rainfall from Hurricane Matthew further exposed those dangers, and the financial liabilities for developers who eschew their responsibility from maintaining those dams.The Army Corps of Engineers counts 3,262 dams in North Carolina - more than most states - and 1,210 of those are considered "high hazard potential," meaning any breaches could affect many people.Woodlake Dam in Moore County - which holds back Lake Surf - almost did breach a few days after the Hurricane - forcing hundreds of evacuations and the displacement of several neighborhoods. The dam, officially registered as Moore-040, is owned by private investors, and was saved only by the heroic efforts of the National Guard which amassed an army of sandbags to plug the holes in the cement and cracked spillway.As the I-Team first reported, however, the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) just ordered the Woodlake owners to breach the dam and drain the lake - drying up the investments of hundreds of homeowners who no longer live on a waterfront property."See that house over my left shoulder? You're looking at my life savings," resident Charlie Jones quipped to the ABC11 I-Team. "My house has gone down 100,000. Someone could say that's too bad, that's my problem - but it is a problem for (Moore County), because that's 100,000 of property valuation that I don't pay taxes on anymore. That could buy a lot of teacher supplies. That could fix a lot of pot holes. That could fix a lot of stuff."Moore County Public Safety/FacebookThe dam has also been a problem for those who live downstream; a problem that nearly turned deadly after Hurricane Matthew. That's when inspectors found holes in the dam's cement and a cracked spillway."I was evacuated from my home and not allowed back in here because if that dam broke, it would kill us," Vass resident Susan Rogers lamented to ABC 11 Eyewitness News. "That dam is a death trap. That's my best words for it. It's a death trap."WATCH: CHOPPER 11 OVER THE LAKE EMBED More News VideosChopper 11 over Woodlake DamAn ABC11 I-Team investigation sought to find out how and why the dam decayed to such an extent, and who should be held responsible.State records show private developers built the dam on Crains Creek in 1973, followed by a resort, golf course, and hundreds of homes along the newly-created waterfront. The property was sold to a German investor, Ingolf Boex, who remained the owner until just a few years ago when he filed for bankruptcy.CLICK HERE FOR THE DOCUMENTS RELATED TO THE I-TEAM INVESTIGATIONAccording to Woodlake residents, maintenance crews were supposed to look over the dam regularly, while state inspectors from the Department of Environmental Quality (formerly the Department of Environment and Natural Resources) would also visit from time to time - as state law requires.The I-Team found several records that confirm those inspections, including a notice dated March 29, 2007, offering four recommendations and warning of the severe risks of a dam failure, including "property damage and/or possible loss of life downstream."Moore County residents evacuated say Woodlake Dam problem for years, yet no one is doing anything about it. pic.twitter.com/RVD3WI221Z— Diane Wilson (@DWilsonABC11) October 12, 2016Inspectors returned to Moore County several times later, issuing a Notice of Deficiency at least three times between April 2014 and July 2015. Among those notices was a Dam Safety Order, setting in place a 91-day deadline for the Woodlake owners submit plans and schedule for dam repairs.Woodlake's owners did submit plans on December 4, 2014 - proposing a 2.5 million restoration that would take place over three years. The state even approved those plans, but they never happened - and the state never issued any fines of penalties. A spokesperson for the DEQ explained the Woodlake's bankruptcy and change of ownership essentially reset the clock on enforcement. DEQ officials added that the new owners decided the original design plans did not meet their expectations, so they hired a new firm.Jones and other Woodlake residents tell the I-Team they've been seeking answers from Woodlake's new ownership group, and the property manager, Julie Watson. Records show the new owner is another German investor, Illya Steiner, the managing partner of Steiner + Company GmBh & Co. KG in Hamburg.At a news conference earlier this month, Watson says Woodlake "intends" to repair the dam once and for all. Watson, however, refused to speak with us. Steiner, similarly, never returned our calls or emails.DEQ officials are now using pumps to drain much of the lake to relieve the pressure on the dam and help facilitate permanent repairs. The DEQ added that officials with the Dam Safety Program met last week with Watson, and a team from the engineering firm Geosyntec. The DEQ ordered Geosyntec to submit a preliminary design for a temporary breach so that there will be no more lake, and thus no more threat to anyone living downstream like the Rogers.The owners will then have to decide what to do - either rebuild the dam or permanently forego the recreation of Woodlake.Officials at the DEQ confirm the state visits high hazard dams for inspections at least once a year, and they encourage residents to play a role in the dam's maintenance. If residents have any questions or concerns about their dam, DEQ engineers are eager to answer those calls at (919) 707-9220.MORE:The state dam safety program pageThe state inventory of dams Related topics:vassiteami teamShare:ShareTweetEmailCopyright © 2022 WTVD-TV.

He was one of tens of thousands of villagers whose homes and fields were about to be engulfed as a dam gushed open to release rising waters. “We have to think big-picture, think of the greater good,” said the farmer identified as Qiao in a recent local news video from Anhui province. “Isn’t it like this every year?”Qiao spoke as many rural residents of the Yangtze River floodplains do, accustomed to swelling waters whenever big rains hit. But this year is the worst in decades, with 433 rivers surging above flood control levels since June, 33 of them setting records.The floods have so far affected more than 54 million people, including 3.7 million displaced and 158 people dead or missing. The surging waters have destroyed 41,000 houses and damaged 368,000 more, according to the Ministry of Emergency Management. Death tolls and battered homes are fewer than in previous years, but displacement and economic loss are far higher. China’s dams — its primary guard against floods — are coming into question as they face increasing strain. Last week, the government blasted open a dam in Anhui. On the same day, more than 16,000 people were trapped in Guzhen town in the same province as the waters surged 10 feet high and broke through levees. Fears are intensifying over the gargantuan Three Gorges Dam, where the reservoir has risen 50 feet above the warning level, to its highest point since the dam was completed in 2006. Rescue volunteers from Ningbo bring villagers back to retrieve items from their flooded homes on July 14. (Liu Bowen / For The Times) Water flows out from sluiceways at the Three Gorges Dam on the Yangtze River in central China’s Hubei province on July 17. (Wang Gang / Xinhua ) AdvertisementChina has more than 98,000 dams, according to the Ministry of Water Resources, more than any other nation. Many were built in the 1950s and ’60s and suffer from poor maintenance.“These flood control engineering projects are not a panacea,” said Ma Jun, director of the Beijing-based Institute of Public & Environmental Affairs. With torrential rains, he added, the amount of water concentrated in each reservoir poses a risk of serious damage, even in small dams.The heavy storms over the Yangtze River basin are the result of a western Pacific subtropical high, a pressure system that every summer carries warm air from south to north. The system is abnormally strong this year, said Liu Junyan, climate and energy campaigner for Greenpeace East Asia, but it is unclear whether it is caused by climate change.The flooding, however, is directly linked to man-made problems. China’s overreliance on dams, excessive construction in low-lying areas, land reclamation in wetlands and lakes, and cities built with poor drainage systems have all exacerbated flood damage.Those chased from their homes also speak of mismanaged flood systems, lack of government accountability and unequal treatment of the rural poor, who bear most of the flood burden.

It’s all trash,” said Ma Dacong, a waste collector who was removing wooden crates, damaged machinery and soggy mountains of boxed tea at Weiwei Chaye, one of many tea factories whose entire stock had been soaked and spoiled in a matter of minutes.Ma calculated more than 143,000 in damage to his machines and pickup trucks. But his was just a small business, he said. The factories, which were paying him a few thousand dollars each to clean up, had lost much more. Their workers swept out brownish-yellow water from the floors; the smell of rot lingered in the air. Days after the flooding, members of the Shao family continue cleanup efforts at their home appliances shop in Shexian, Anhui province.(Liu Bowen / For The Times) Workers at the home appliances shop try to clean and salvage parts to sell at a discount.(Liu Bowen / For The Times) “The water came so fast. We could never have imagined it,” said Shao, 49, the co-owner of a home appliance shop in Shexian who did not give his full name. His relatives and store employees sat on its front steps, rinsing kitchen and bathroom appliance parts that they hoped to still sell.As a small family firm, the shop had struggled to survive the first half of the year, when coronavirus lockdowns cut into business. Its warehouses were full, with business restarting only a month or so ago as the outbreak waned.They had been sleeping when the waters roiled around 5 a.m. that day, rushing over riverbanks to swallow sidewalks and streets.By 5:30 a.m., the water was at people’s shins. By 6 a.m., it was approaching their waists. By 7:30 a.m., it was 6½ feet high, and factory workers, shop owners, and high schoolers who’d woken early for their college entrance exams were climbing onto second floors and rooftops to escape.“If the government just gave us half a day’s warning, I could have saved 14,000 to 28,000 in damage,” Shao said. He’d lost at least 43,000, he said, and had received no government relief, a maddening, if typical, setback in this region.

Yet dams have been a point of pride for the Communist Party. The Three Gorges Dam in particular has been touted by the Chinese government as a symbol of national prestige, despite controversies over the mass displacement, environmental destruction, pollution, landslides and earthquake risks it has caused.The choice of where to let waters out and whom to flood highlights inequalities. China tends to prioritize protection of cities — “more populous and economically important regions,” Ma said — at the cost of villagers, mostly farmers or migrant workers. Those who get flooded should not be living so close to the rivers, but many of them “don’t have a choice,” he added.China’s hukou system ties every citizen’s access to healthcare, education and other social services to their place of origin. Villagers who move to cities for work cannot truly settle in urban areas and tend to send money back to their hometown. Flooding villages and small towns costs less overall than flooding a city, but it means that those with less cushion for survival are hit hardest. A villager pumps water from a well in Xixinan village, Anhui province. Urbanization and industrial pollution have severely affected groundwater in China — 80% of it is unsafe for consumption, and without better methods of rainwater absorption, the levels are dropping every year.(Liu Bowen / For The Times) A farmer in Xixinan village steps into a stream encased in concrete. China’s approach to its water system focuses on speeding water through artificial walls, says Peking University professor Yu Kongjian. (Liu Bowen / For the Times) Some environmentalists and engineers say China should revamp its entire flood control approach.“All our urban planning and design has this single-minded concept: to speed up the water and flush it out. But we need to do the opposite,” said Yu Kongjian, Peking University professor and founder of a landscape architecture firm called Turenscape. Yu studied design at Harvard and returned to China a year before catastrophic flooding along the Yangtze River killed more than 4,000 people in 1998. He spent the next 20 years urging Chinese officials to adopt an eco-centric approach to urbanization.China’s cities should be like sponges, not toilets, he said. Water should be slowed down and retained, not flushed away. The way to do that, Yu said, is by restoring riverbanks, wetlands and lakes, complete with their living “sponges” of soil and vegetation that can absorb and keep water locally. World & Nation First a pandemic, then the floods: Villagers in southern China face devastation again As levees break and houses topple into rivers, Chinese farmers and migrant workers in rural areas of Jiangxi province struggle to survive. Advertisement“I am not against dams and hydrological structures, but I am opposed to over-reliance on human flood control, these ‘gray’ infrastructures that destroy the green and natural system,” Yu said. “Just like a person, if you stay alive only by relying on a ventilator and injections, you are fragile. What will happen when the machines break? The human will face the risk of death. Cities are the same.”Building dams and binding rivers with concrete are methods China learned from the West. But many ecologists there have also begun advocating for fewer dams and giving space back to nature. “Man cannot win against nature,” Yu said. “Everything man-made is destined to break one day. The ruins of Rome tell us that.” Everything man-made is destined to break one day. The ruins of Rome tell us that. — Yu Kongjian That was once a radical idea, especially in post-1949 China, which has a tragic history of trying to bend nature to its will. Tens of millions starved to death in China’s Great Famine of 1958-61 after Mao Zedong commanded people to meet unrealistic crop quotas through unscientific planting methods copied from the Soviet Union. The Soviets also designed China’s Banqiao Dam in Henan province, which was heralded as an “iron dam” able to withstand a once-in-2,000-years flood. An engineer who questioned the design was fired. In 1975, the dam broke during a typhoon, killing an estimated 86,000 to 230,000 people (the government figure versus an estimate from critics) from immediate impact, starvation and epidemics from the floodwaters. It was the deadliest dam failure in history. China banned media coverage and only declassified information about it in 2005.But these days, President Xi Jinping has called for China to build an “ecological civilization,” and Yu has found enough government support to start “sponge city” projects in dozens of Chinese cities. Yu Kongjian stands in a dried-out pond in Xixinan village, Anhui province, that was once used for irrigation. China needs to restore ponds like this, Yu said, to retain water locally.(Liu Bowen / For The Times) They are a step forward against a ticking clock, as climate change exposes China to more severe and frequent droughts and floods. The occurrence of heavy rains has risen by about 3.8% per decade since 1931, according to China’s Blue Book on Climate Change (2019). That’s a total increase of more than 20%, Liu said: “Very severe change.”AdvertisementDams built to withstand floods that happen “once every thousand years” are now facing extreme water levels within 100, or 50 or 10 years of their construction, Yu said. No dam lasts forever, he added. It is not a question of whether but when each one ends — and who potentially pays the price.

TÜV SÜD faces group claim in Germany over 2019 Brazil dam collapse | ReutersDiscover Thomson ReutersDirectory of sitesLoginContactSupportfor-phone-onlyfor-tablet-portrait-upfor-tablet-landscape-upfor-desktop-upfor-wide-desktop-upIndustry, Materials and UtilitiesUpdated TÜV SÜD faces group claim in Germany over 2019 Brazil dam collapse By Kirstin Ridley3 Min ReadLONDON, Jan 22 (Reuters) - German industrial inspector TÜV SÜD is facing a claim for “significant damages” in the first civil lawsuit on German soil over its alleged role in the deadly collapse of a dam in Brazil two years ago.A group of Brazilian claimants allege TÜV SÜD was responsible for certifying the Brumadinho tailings dam when it was unsafe for fear of losing Brazil’s Vale, the world’s largest iron ore producer that operated the dam, as a client.TÜV SÜD said in a statement it remained convinced it had no legal responsibility for the dam failure.The dam in southeastern Brazil burst in January 2019, four months after it was certified, unleashing an avalanche of waste that killed about 270 people in the country’s deadliest mining accident.The group action, brought on behalf of Brazil’s municipality of Brumadinho and the family of one of the victims by law firm PGMBM and German counsel, alleges TÜV SÜD made “market adjustments” to safety standards that lowered them below international standards.“Our evidence shows that TÜV SÜD certified this dam as safe when it most certainly was not – a fact they knew then,” said Tom Goodhead, managing partner of PGMBM.TÜV SÜD said its thoughts continued to be with the victims, that it remained keen to clarify the cause of the accident and continued to cooperate with Brazilian authorities. It said it would defend itself against the latest allegations.“TÜV SÜD is convinced (it) has no legal responsibility for the Brumadinho dam failure,” the company said in a statement, adding it believed its Brazilian division and Vale had complied with local laws and standards at the time.The claimants say they are bringing the lawsuit in Germany under Brazilian law because access to justice in Brazil is slow and inefficient. They will initially seek an indication from the district court in Munich, southern Germany, that TÜV SÜD is liable in principle before properly quantifying damages.TÜV SÜD, which no longer offers dam safety inspections, has faced criminal investigations in Germany and Brazil, where the company was last year charged with environmental crimes and five workers with homicide.1 = 0.8237 euros Additional reporting by John O’Donnell in Frankfurt.
