    "question": "What were the main reasons for the failure of the Midland dam in Michigan despite repeated warnings?",
    "answer": "The failure of the Midland dam in Michigan was attributed to weak regulations that failed to enforce necessary structural corrections. Over nearly three decades, government regulators warned the Edenville Dam was at risk of failing in a flood. Despite these warnings and the dam's structural deficiencies, needed repairs were never completed. A complex mix of factors contributed, including the high cost of repairs, the dam's private ownership providing public benefits, and a regulatory system powerless to enforce changes. The shift of regulatory oversight from federal to state authorities also brought challenges, as Michigan regulators lacked adequate staffing and resources to address the issues in a timely manner."
