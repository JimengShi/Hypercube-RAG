    "question": "What are the key factors influencing the selection of cost-effective biological management practices for reducing surface runoff in arid and semi-arid watersheds?",
    "answer": "The key factors include the types, quantities, and locations of biological best management practices (BMPs), implementation costs, and the effectiveness of runoff reduction."

    "question": "How do morpho-hydrologic parameters influence flood generation potential in ungauged river basins?",
    "answer": "Morpho-hydrologic parameters such as drainage density, time of concentration, and relative relief significantly affect the speed and volume of surface runoff, thereby influencing flood generation potential."

    "index": 98,
    "question": "How do different plant drought adaptation strategies impact water yield and vegetation productivity in semi-arid environments?",
    "answer": "Drought-avoiding strategies lead to higher water yield but lower vegetation productivity compared to drought-tolerating strategies, which enhance productivity at the expense of water yield."

    "index": 99,
    "question": "What factors influence the spatial and temporal variations of solute concentrations in rivers within arid watersheds?",
    "answer": "Evapotranspiration and hydrologic connectivity to local solute stores significantly influence the spatial and temporal variations of solute concentrations in rivers of arid watersheds."

    "question": "What are the mechanisms of runoff generation in watersheds and how do they influence flood forecasting models?",
    "answer": "The mechanisms of runoff generation in watersheds include saturation-excess runoff and infiltration-excess runoff, which influence flood forecasting models by determining the patterns and dynamics of water flow during rainfall events."
