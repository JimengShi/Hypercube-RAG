{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_0", "content": "Six months after the deadly Category 5 hurricane, Virginia Tech civil and environmental engineering Professor Amy Pruden led a team of Virginia Tech researchers, including Maria Virginia Riquelme and William Rhoads, then post-doctoral researchers, who packed their bags and lab supplies and headed to Puerto Rico.The island territory of the United States located in the northeast of the Caribbean Sea had been devastated, plunging its 3.4 million inhabitants into crisis. The mass destruction presented a critical opportunity for the researchers to study how wastewater infrastructure damage might contribute to the spread of antibiotic resistance -- a growing global public health threat.In a study published in American Chemical Society's \"This study is a critical step toward establishing a unified and comprehensive surveillance approach for antibiotic resistance in watersheds,\" said Pruden, the W. Thomas Rice Professor of Civil and Environmental Engineering. \"Ideally, it can be applied as a baseline to track disturbances and public health concerns associated with future storms.\"Over the past decade, Pruden, a microbiologist and environmental engineer, has worked with her students using next-generation DNA sequencing, a specialty of Pruden's, to examine Legionella strains as they operate before, during, after, and outside of Legionnaires' disease outbreaks in various towns and cities across the country, including Flint, Michigan.With RAPID funding from the National Science Foundation and collaborating with principal investigator Christina Bandoragoda, research scientist at the University of Washington with expertise in watershed modeling and geospatial analysis, Virginia Tech researchers teamed up with Graciela Ramirez Toro, professor and director of the Centro de EducaciÃ³n, ConservaciÃ³n e InterpretaciÃ³n Ambiental, and her research group at the local Interamerican University in San German, Puerto Rico. Together, they identified three sampling sites in watersheds with distinct land-use patterns and levels of wastewater input that were ideal for tracking down geospatial patterns in occurrence of bacterial genes that cause antibiotic resistance.Pruden's doctoral student and first author of the paper Benjamin Davis used a method called shotgun metagenomic DNA sequencing to detect antibiotic resistance genes in river water samples from three watersheds, including samples collected by hiking to far upstream pristine reaches of the watersheds and downstream of three wastewater treatment plants. Metagenomics is the study of genetic material recovered directly from environmental samples.Analysis of the data revealed that two anthropogenic antibiotic resistance markers -- DNA sequences associated with human impacts to the watershed -- correlated with a distinct set of antibiotic resistance genes, relative to those that correlated specifically with human fecal markers.A clear demarcation of wastewater treatment plant influence on the antibiotic resistance gene profiles was apparent and levels were elevated downstream of wastewater treatment plants, resulting in a high diversity of genes impacting resistance to clinically important antibiotics, such as beta lactams and aminoglycosides, in the watershed samples. Some of the beta lactam resistance genes detected were associated with deadly antibiotic-resistant infections in the region and showed evidence of being able to jump across bacterial strains. Beta lactam resistance genes were also noted to be more accurately predicted by anthropogenic antibiotic resistance markers than human fecal markers.Although baseline levels of antibiotic resistance genes in Puerto Rican watersheds prior to Hurricane Maria are unknown, surveillance methodologies like these could be used to assess future impacts of major storms on the spread of antibiotic resistance, the researchers said.Many international communities will likely not have access to sophisticated metagenomic-based monitoring tools in the near future, but the identification of single gene targets, such as the anthropogenic antibiotic resistance markers, make watershed surveillance of antibiotic resistance much more accessible. And such genes can be quantified directly by quantitative polymerase chain reaction, yielding cost-effective, rapid results in less than a day."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_1", "content": "This means that changes in atmospheric circulation, driven by differential ocean warming, heavily influence the location and intensity of tropical cyclones.In the first study of its kind so close to the equator, lead author James Bramante reconstructed 3,000 years of storm history on Jaluit Atoll in the southern Marshall Islands. This region is the birthplace of tropical cyclones in the western North Pacific -- the world's most active tropical cyclone zone. Using differences in sediment size as evidence of extreme weather events, Bramante found that tropical cyclones occurred in the region roughly once a century, but increased to a maximum of four per century from 1350 to 1700 CE, a period known as the Little Ice Age.Bramante, a recent graduate of the MIT-WHOI Joint Program in Oceanography/Applied Ocean Science and Engineering, says this finding sheds light on how climate change affects where cyclones are able to form.\"Atmospheric circulation changes due to modern, human-induced climate warming are opposite of the circulation changes due to the Little Ice Age,\" notes Bramante. \"So we can expect to see the opposite effect in the deep tropics -- a decrease in tropical cyclones close to the equator. It could be good news for the southern Marshall Islands, but other areas would be threatened as the average location of cyclone generation shifts north,\" he adds.During major storm events, coarse sediment is stirred up and deposited by currents and waves into \"blue holes,\" ancient caves that collapsed and turned into sinkholes that filled with sea water over thousands of years. In a 2015 field study, Bramante and his colleagues took samples from a blue hole on Jaluit Atoll and found coarse sediment among the finer grains of sand. After sorting the grains by size and analyzing the data from Typhoon Ophelia, which devastated the atoll in 1958, the researchers had a template with which to identify other storm events that appear in the sediment record. They then used radiocarbon dating -- a method of determining age by the ratio of carbon isotopes in a sample -- to date the sediment in each layer.Armed with previously-collected data about the ancient climate from tree rings, coral cores, and fossilized marine organisms, the researchers were able to piece together the conditions that existed at the time. By connecting this information with the record of storms preserved in sediment from Jaluit Atoll, the researchers demonstrated through computer modeling that the particular set of conditions responsible for equatorial trade winds heavily influenced the number, intensity and location where cyclones would form.Jeff Donnelly, a WHOI senior scientist and a co-author of the study, used similar methods to reconstruct the history of hurricanes in the North Atlantic and Caribbean. He plans to expand the Marshall Islands study westward to the Philippines to study where tropical cyclones have historically formed and how climate conditions influence a storm's track and intensity. Better understanding of how storms behaved under previous conditions will help scientists understand what causes changes in tropical cyclone activity and aid people living in coastal communities prepare for extreme weather in the future, he said.\"Through the geologic archive, we can get a baseline that tells us how at-risk we really are at any one location,\" Donnelly says. \"It turns out the past provides some useful analogies for the climate change that we're currently undergoing. The earth has already run this experiment. Now we're trying to go back and determine the drivers of tropical cyclones.\""}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_2", "content": "The researchers showed that hurricanes that develop over warmer oceans carry more moisture and therefore stay stronger for longer after hitting land. This means that in the future, as the world continues to warm, hurricanes are more likely to reach communities farther inland and be more destructive.\"The implications are very important, especially when considering policies that are put in place to cope with global warming,\" said Professor Pinaki Chakraborty, senior author of the study and head of the Fluid Mechanics Unit at the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University (OIST). \"We know that coastal areas need to ready themselves for more intense hurricanes, but inland communities, who may not have the know-how or infrastructure to cope with such intense winds or heavy rainfall, also need to be prepared.\"Many studies have shown that climate change can intensify hurricanes -- known as cyclones or typhoons in other regions of the world -- over the open ocean. But this is the first study to establish a clear link between a warming climate and the smaller subset of hurricanes that have made landfall.The scientists analyzed North Atlantic hurricanes that made landfall over the past half a century. They found that during the course of the first day after landfall, hurricanes weakened almost twice as slowly now than they did 50 years ago.\"When we plotted the data, we could clearly see that the amount of time it took for a hurricane to weaken was increasing with the years. But it wasn't a straight line -- it was undulating -- and we found that these ups and downs matched the same ups and downs seen in sea surface temperature,\" said Lin Li, first author and PhD student in the OIST Fluid Mechanics Unit.The scientists tested the link between warmer sea surface temperature and slower weakening past landfall by creating computer simulations of four different hurricanes and setting different temperatures for the surface of the sea.Once each virtual hurricane reached category 4 strength, the scientists simulated landfall by cutting off the supply of moisture from beneath.Li explained: \"Hurricanes are heat engines, just like engines in cars. In car engines, fuel is combusted, and that heat energy is converted into mechanical work. For hurricanes, the moisture taken up from the surface of the ocean is the \"fuel\" that intensifies and sustains a hurricane's destructive power, with heat energy from the moisture converted into powerful winds.\"Making landfall is equivalent to stopping the fuel supply to the engine of a car. Without fuel, the car will decelerate, and without its moisture source, the hurricane will decay.\"The researchers found that even though each simulated hurricane made landfall at the same intensity, the ones that developed over warmer waters took more time to weaken.\"These simulations proved what our analysis of past hurricanes had suggested: warmer oceans significantly impact the rate that hurricanes decay, even when their connection with the ocean's surface is severed. The question is -- why?\" said Prof. Chakraborty.Using additional simulations, the scientists found that \"stored moisture\" was the missing link.The researchers explained that when hurricanes make landfall, even though they can no longer access the ocean's supply of moisture, they still carry a stock of moisture that slowly depletes.When the scientists created virtual hurricanes that lacked this stored moisture after hitting land, they found that the sea surface temperature no longer had any impact on the rate of decay.\"This shows that stored moisture is the key factor that gives each hurricane in the simulation its own unique identity,\" said Li. \"Hurricanes that develop over warmer oceans can take up and store more moisture, which sustains them for longer and prevents them from weakening as quickly.\"The increased level of stored moisture also makes hurricanes \"wetter\" -- an outcome already being felt as recent hurricanes have unleashed devastatingly high volumes of rainfall on coastal and inland communities.This research highlights the importance for climate models to carefully account for stored moisture when predicting the impact of warmer oceans on hurricanes.The study also pinpoints issues with the simple theoretical models widely used to understand how hurricanes decay.\"Current models of hurricane decay don't consider moisture -- they just view hurricanes that have made landfall as a dry vortex that rubs against the land and is slowed down by friction. Our work shows these models are incomplete, which is why this clear signature of climate change wasn't previously captured,\" said Li.The researchers now plan to study hurricane data from other regions of the world to determine whether the impact of a warming climate on hurricane decay is occurring across the globe.Prof. Chakraborty concluded: \"Overall, the implications of this work are stark. If we don't curb global warming, landfalling hurricanes will continue to weaken more slowly. Their destruction will no longer be confined to coastal areas, causing higher levels of economic damage and costing more lives.\""}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_3", "content": "Elizabeth Tennant, postdoctoral associate in economics at Cornell University, wondered: What made the difference?To quantify the relationship between natural disaster outcomes and the effectiveness of governments and other institutions, Tennant and co-author Elisabeth Gilmore, associate professor in the Department of International Development, Community and Environment at Clark University, analyzed data from more than 1,000 tropical cyclones from 1979 to 2016. They found, in a paper published Nov. 3 in Moreover, storms concentrated in areas with weaker public services, as indicated by elevated infant mortality rates, are especially deadly, the researchers found.\"These results suggest that policies and programs to enhance institutional capacity and governance can support risk reduction from extreme weather events,\" Tennant wrote.One of the original motivations of the study, Tennant said, was to better understand how effective institutions and governments can moderate the increasing risks of future extreme weather events due to climate change. This research contributes to the body of evidence that institutions are an important foundation for climate adaptation, Tennant said.There are many examples indicating that strong institutions -- including government -- play a critical role in protecting populations from adverse effects of natural disasters, Tennant said. But it is much more difficult to determine how universal this relationship is, she said, because there is so much variation in the frequency and severity of storms.Natural hazards such as cyclones, the researcher wrote, result in disasters only when vulnerable human systems are exposed to hazardous conditions. In their analysis, Tennant and Gilmore explicitly accounted for hazard exposure, connecting the analysis of governance and other indicators of well-being to estimates of the severity and exposure to the tropical cyclone hazard.They used several data sources to gather information about people, places, events and storms, including: the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration; the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters Emergency Events Database; and World Governance Indicators.\"We developed an approach where we carefully modeled the extent of the storms to match them to the measures of governance and living conditions in affected areas,\" Tennant said. \"This helps us to identify what makes people vulnerable.\"Tennant first became interested in the intersections of disasters and development during her time as a Peace Corps volunteer in Honduras, where resources were constrained.\"I saw how a decade after the devastating Hurricane Mitch [1998], the disaster still affected the local communities and their well-being,\" Tennant said. \"So what does disaster preparedness look like in a country where many people are without secure access to nutritional food and clean drinking water now? To what extent can investing in health, education and the quality of governments and institutions also serve as a useful foundation for disaster risk reduction activities?\"While the study does not suggest specific approaches to improving the quality and effectiveness of institutions, it does highlight their importance, Tennant said. \"Ensuring that local institutions are involved and accountable for the delivery of public services may have multiple benefits,\" she said, \"including reducing deaths from natural disasters.\"And while the researchers completed the study before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the results are consistent with lessons emerging from the virus, Tennant said: \"In our view, the pandemic has provided an immediate example of how government effectiveness plays an important role in shaping societal risks, regardless of a country's wealth.\""}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_4", "content": "Scientists have looked at death certificates to see if the cause could be linked up clearly to a storm, but it is easy to miss something in this type of data review. A person could have a heart attack brought on by stress from clearing tree limbs in a yard, following a storm.An interdisciplinary team -- including epidemiologists, engineers, an atmospheric scientist and software developer -- led by Colorado State University (CSU) has created an open source data set that can be used for epidemiological research on tropical cyclones. The new tool also provides insights that can guide the design and analysis of this type of research.The paper describing the new data set, \"Assessing United States County-Level Exposure for Research on Tropical Cyclones and Human Health,\" is published Oct. 28 in Brooke Anderson, lead author of the paper and an associate professor in the Department of Environmental and Radiological Health Sciences at CSU, teamed up on this project with scientists including Andrea Schumacher, research associate with the Cooperative Institute for Research in the Atmosphere (CIRA) at CSU.\"For heatwaves, there has already been a lot of research on what the risks are for human health,\" said Anderson. Scientists can estimate community-wide deaths and illnesses associated with several types of climate-related disasters, including heat waves, floods and wildfires, she added.Anderson said that with this new data set, scientists can now analyze multiple storms in different places and time periods, and drill down to see what happens in different health outcomes for people. Prior to the release of this new tool, most research has focused on data related to a single storm.Schumacher said she's always been interested in looking at how counties across the country are affected by hurricane winds on a broad scale. And she found the perfect research partner in Anderson.\"Brooke and I found that we had a similar interest in characterizing hurricane winds,\" said Schumacher, who helps develop satellite-based products for hurricane forecasters.Data set designed for others to build upon The team used what's known as the R programming language to create the data set, which will allow scientists from around the world to add new facets and enrich what the team has started.Anderson said the concept is similar to when a child gets a toy train set, and it just comes with an oval. \"Next, the grandparents come along, and you get a bridge or you get new roads that head off in different directions,\" she said.The new tool -- maintained by an international group of volunteers on the Comprehensive R Archive Network, CRAN -- also provides very precise data. A scientist can look at rainfall during Hurricane Floyd from several days before (or after) the storm came, Anderson said.CSU scientists are already using the new data set to look at Medicare hospitalizations following storms over a decade in the Eastern United States. Anderson said the team found that the number of people being hospitalized for respiratory conditions tended to increase when the storm hit, and a week after.Another team she's part of used the dataset to look at how tropical cyclones affect different birth outcomes, including pre-term birth and pregnancy outcomes.Schumacher said she sees lots of possibilities for where this research tool can go.\"From my end, there's still plenty of work to do,\" she said. \"What we've created is a really good start. I can see all kinds of ways that we can improve on it, especially as we get better and better observations.\""}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_5", "content": "Such predictions rely on historical records that reveal cyclic changes, such as the El NiÃ±o-Southern Oscillation, that can affect hurricane frequency. But the short observational records that exist for many regions, including Florida's East Coast, are inadequate for detecting climate patterns that fluctuate over longer timeframes.Now new research presented Wednesday at the annual meeting of The Geological Society of America is extending Florida's hurricane record thousands of years back in time -- and hinting at a surprise finding.\"There has been little to no research done on the hurricane record for Florida's East Coast,\" explains Ilexxis Morales, a graduate student in the Environmental Science program at Florida Gulf Coast University and the study's lead author. \"The national hurricane database for this area currently only extends back to the 1850s,\" she says.But what that record suggests, says Morales, is quite intriguing, especially with respect to intense (category 3-5) storms. \"It shows that at least for the past 170 years, Florida's Atlantic Coast has been hit by fewer intense hurricanes than the state's Gulf Coast,\" she says.To better understand this discrepancy, Morales and her Florida Gulf Coast University co-authors, Joanne Muller and James Javaruski, collected sediment cores from a series of lagoons tucked behind narrow barrier islands along the state's eastern coast. Their analysis shows that in contrast to the dark organic matter that comprises most of the cores, hurricanes leave behind a coarser deposit distinctive enough to be called a \"tempest.\"\"When a large storm comes through the area,\" says Morales, \"it picks up light-colored sand from the beach and deposits it in the lagoon.\" Because the grains of sand deposited by large storms are coarser than the organic-rich muds, the researchers can detect ancient tempest deposits using simple grain-size analyses.After identifying the tempest deposits (called tempestites), the team used a variety of methods, including a Lead-210 germanium detector and radiocarbon dating, to determine their ages. While still preliminary, the results from the seven cores the researchers have analyzed to date suggest that there are fewer visible tempestites in the East Coast cores compared to those analyzed from the West Coast.The results hint that the pattern of more major hurricanes hitting Florida's Gulf Coast may extend thousands of years back in time. Morales speculates this difference could be due to the shifting position of the Bermuda High, a semi-permanent ridge of high pressure that can affect a hurricane's direction. \"When the Bermuda High is in a more northeasterly position, hurricanes tend to track along Florida's East Coast and up to the Carolinas,\" says Morales. \"When it shifts southwestward towards the U.S., the high tends to push storms into the Gulf of Mexico instead.\" Sea-surface temperatures can also help explain the difference, says Morales. \"Normally the Atlantic is colder than the Gulf, and this colder water makes it harder for hurricanes to sustain their strength,\" she explains.Similar \"paleotempestology\" studies have been conducted in other locations that are also susceptible to hurricanes, including Texas, Louisiana, New England, and even Australia, and the results have a number of practical applications. \"This data will go to the national hurricane database, which will then help meteorologists better predict storm paths,\" Morales says. The data will also help show which areas are more susceptible to hurricane damage, enabling insurance companies to better adjust hurricane-insurance rates and developers to select building sites less susceptible to storm surge.Once complete, says study co-author James Javaruski, the longer storm record could help researchers determine whether changes observed in it can be attributed to human-induced climate change. The findings can also offer insight into what could happen in the future. \"If we see in other studies that sea surface temperatures were increasing over a certain time frame and find that hurricanes also increased over that same time frame,\" Javaruski says, \"it can give us a good idea of what to expect as we artificially raise sea surface temperatures now.\""}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_6", "content": "\"There are critical questions around the formation and intensification of hurricanes that makes forecasting them extremely difficult,\" said James H. Ruppert Jr., assistant research professor of meteorology and atmospheric science, Penn State. \"We don't yet have sufficient understanding of the processes that drive storm formation.\"Tropical depressions are the weak precursors to intense hurricanes, usually identifiable as a disorganized cluster of clouds in a weak low-pressure area, according to Rupert.\"The tropical depression stage is usually the first time that forecasters are able to identify and start tracking a storm,\" he said.Environmental conditions usually provide a narrow window in which these depressions can form into intense tropical cyclones.\"Understanding the transition from this depression stage to an intensifying hurricane is what we are after,\" said Ruppert.To investigate tropical cyclone formation, the researchers looked at storms forming in the Atlantic and in the western Pacific oceans. They considered two storms, Super Typhoon Haiyan, which occurred in 2013, and Hurricane Maria, which occurred in 2017.The researchers found that infrared radiative feedback from clouds creates a localized greenhouse effect that traps heat in the area of the tropical depression. Deep clouds that are heavily laden with water droplets and ice crystals trap outgoing infrared radiation and warm the atmosphere. This local warming causes lifting motion in the storm, which helps fully saturate the atmosphere and increase inward flowing winds near the ocean's surface. As long as the storm is more than a few degrees above or below the equator, the Coriolis Effect causes these inward flowing winds to form a circulation near the surface. This circulation then intensifies with the help of surface evaporation and eventually forms a central eye, taking on the classic appearance of an intense tropical cyclone.The researchers found that the localized warming created by the cloud greenhouse effect helped accelerate the formation of both Haiyan and Maria. When they removed the effect in the model simulation, the storms either formed more slowly or not at all. The researchers argue that the cloud greenhouse effect is therefore likely instrumental in the formation of many tropical storm events. They report their results today (Oct. 26) in the \"Our ultimate goal is to better forecast tropical cyclones, and it currently remains very hard to forecast storm formation,\" said Ruppert. \"Storm track forecasting has improved immensely in recent decades. Large-scale winds primarily control storm tracks and our ability to both measure and predict these winds has improved greatly, allowing for major progress in storm track prediction. The small-scale processes that govern storm formation and intensification in the first place -- that is where our understanding and ability to observe are still really challenged.\""}

They assessed the frequency and locations of storms and trends in tropical cyclone movement speed -- how quickly a storm moves forward -- globally and regionally in each ocean basin.\"For people in Hawai'i, the threat of hurricanes is always there every year,\" said Chu. \"If hurricanes move faster they would pose danger to coastal communities and emergency managers because they would have less time to prepare for evacuation and other measures.\"The recent study suggests the reason for the observed changes is a combination of natural variations and human-induced climate change.The researchers continue the study the trends in and connections between climate variability and tropical cyclone activity."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_8", "content": "In a new study published in the journal Although hurricane track forecasting has significantly improved in recent decades, there are still significant errors in some cases, and the consequences can be severe. In particular, uncertainty regarding the paths of upper-level troughs with strong winds in the mid-latitudes can lead to greater uncertainty when they influence the tracks of tropical cyclones. The research team found that in cases of hurricanes steered by upper-level troughs, forecasting errors of the hurricanes' central positions were larger than those in cases not influenced by upper-level troughs.Lead author Kazutoshi Sato explains, \"During the forecast period Hurricane Irma in 2017, there was large meandering of the jet stream over the North Pacific and North Atlantic, which introduced large errors in the forecasts. When we included additional radiosonde observation data from the Research Vessel Mirai collected in the Arctic in the late summer of 2017, the error and ensemble spread of the upper-level trough at the initial time of forecast were improved, which increased the accuracy of the track forecast for Irma.\"The researchers also investigated the effect of including additional dropsonde data collected by the United States Air Force Reserve Command and the Aircraft Operations Center of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration over the Atlantic Ocean near Hurricane Irma in 2017. Hurricane forecast accuracy was improved both by dropsonde measurements near the hurricanes and by radiosonde observations over the Arctic Ocean.According to co-author Jun Inoue, an associate professor of National Institute of Polar Research, \"Our findings show that developing a more efficient observation system over the higher latitudes will be greatly beneficial to tropical cyclone track forecasting over the mid-latitudes, which will help mitigate the human casualties and socioeconomic losses caused by these storms.\""}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_9", "content": "\"We know ice sheets are melting as global temperatures increase, but uncertainties remain about how much and how fast that will happen,\" said Chris Forest, professor of climate dynamics at Penn State. \"Our findings shed new light on one area of uncertainty, suggesting climate variability has a significant impact on melting ice sheets and sea level rise.\"While it is understood that continued warming may cause rapid ice loss, models that predict how Antarctica will respond to climate change have not included the potential impacts of internal climate variability, like yearly and decadal fluctuations in the climate, the team of scientists said.Accounting for climate variability caused models to predict an additional 2.7 to 4.3 inches -- 7 to 11 centimeters -- of sea level rise by 2100, the scientists recently reported in the journal \"That increase alone is comparable to the amount of sea level rise we have seen over the last few decades,\" said Forest, who has appointments in the departments of meteorology and atmospheric science and geosciences. \"Every bit adds on to the storm surge, which we expect to see during hurricanes and other severe weather events, and the results can be devastating.\"The Antarctic ice sheet is a complex system, and modeling how it will evolve under future climate conditions requires thousands of simulations and large amounts of computing power. Because of this, modelers test how the ice will respond using a mean temperature found by averaging the results of climate models.However, that process smooths out peaks caused by climate variability and reduces the average number of days above temperature thresholds that can impact the ice sheet melt, creating a bias in the results, the scientists said.\"If we include variability in the simulations, we are going to have more warm days and more sunshine, and therefore when the daily temperature gets above a certain threshold it will melt the ice,\" Forest said. \"If we're just running with average conditions, we're not seeing these extremes happening on yearly or decadal timescales.\"To study the effects of internal climate variability, the researchers analyzed two large ensembles of climate simulations. Large ensembles are generated by starting each member with slightly different initial conditions. The chaotic nature of the climate system causes each member to yield slightly different responses, and this represents internally generated variability, the scientists said.Instead of averaging the results of each ensemble, the scientists fed the atmospheric and oceanic data representing this variability into a three-dimensional Antarctic ice sheet model. They found atmospheric variations had a larger and more immediate impact on the ice sheet, but ocean variability was also a significant factor.Extensive parts of the ice sheet are in contact with ocean water, and previous studies have suggested that warming oceans could cause large chunks to break away. The process may expose ice cliffs so tall that they collapse under their own weight, inducing a domino effect that further depletes the ice shelf.The scientists found model simulations that did not include the effects of internal climate variability significantly delayed the retreat of the ice sheet by up to 20 years and underestimated future sea level rise.\"This additional ice melt will impact the hurricane storm surges across the globe. Additionally, for years, the IPCC reports have been looking at sea level rise without considering this additional variability and have been underestimating what the impact may be,\" Forest said. \"It's important to better understand these processes contributing to the additional ice loss because the ice sheets are melting much faster than we expected.\"The National Science Foundation and the Penn State Center for Climate Risk Management funded this research."}

Sample sites were chosen using a new genetic-aging technique to identify key sites and minimize damage to the living coral.The data revealed coral samples ranging in age from 1910 (based on carbon dating) or 1915 (based on thorium dating) to at least November 2019; Greer and colleagues were also able to determine that Coral Gardens Reef has been home to consistent and sustained living A. cervicornis coral throughout the 1980s and up to at least 2019. While the authors cannot exclude the possibility of short gaps in the presence of A. cervicornis prior to 1980, the radiometric ages and continuous coral growth patterns found at the sample sites strongly suggests that Acropora coral has been growing and thriving at Coral Gardens for over 100 years.Though the results from this study are not sufficient to determine exactly why this site seems to be a refuge for Acropora coral -- Coral Gardens has been subject to the same increases in temperature and tropical storm/hurricane activity as reefs in the region with devastated coral populations, and the genetic diversity of Acropora is not unusually high -- the findings here may be key to efforts to grow, preserve, conserve, and re-seed Caribbean reefs, as is identifying similar coral refuge sites in the area.The authors add: \"Now that we have identified an exceptional refuge for Caribbean Staghorn corals, we hope to better determine, in collaboration with reef scientists with many additional interests and expertise, the sources for success at Coral Gardens.\""}

Importantly, this pre-landfall intensification was not well predicted by hurricane models or forecasts, which as you can imagine is critical information for evacuation and disaster preparation.\"Dzwonkowski and his team's publication, \"Compounding impact of severe weather events fuels marine heatwave in the coastal ocean,\" outlines how one storm could impact the intensity of another storm by restructuring the thermal properties of the water column. The research focuses on Hurricane Michael which devastated Mexico Beach, Florida, and the surrounding communities, on October 10, 2018. The category 5 storm intensified hours before making landfall.Dzwonkowski, a physical oceanographer with the Dauphin Island Sea Lab and Associate Professor at the University of South Alabama in the Department of Marine Sciences, and his team tracked down the key events and processes that pushed the coastal waters in the Gulf of Mexico to an extremely warm state (i.e. a marine heatwave), likely contributing to the intensification of a storm so close to shore.Unlike the deep ocean, the continental shelf has a shallow bottom that limits how much cold water can be mixed up to the surface, cooling the sea surface temperature and weakening approaching storms. Dzwonkowski and his team focused on how a strong mixing event pushes surface heat downward and clears the bottom water of its cold water reserve. If this mixing is followed by a period of rewarming, such as an atmospheric heatwave, the shelf's oceanic environment could be primed for the potential generation of extreme storm events, i.e. Hurricane Michael.\"This work shows that understanding the preceding weather conditions in a region where a storm is going to make landfall can improve interpretation of hurricane model forecasts and what the storm is likely to do prior to landfall,\" says Dr. DzwonkowskiIn mapping out heat flux and mixing, the team focused on the Mississippi Bight in late summer and early fall with data gathered by a mooring site off Dauphin Island's coastline. The mooring site collects data throughout the water column allowing for the full heat content of the shelf to be determined. The period prior to the landfall of Hurricane Michael turned out to be the warmest ocean conditions during this time period in the 13-year record.\"Turns out hurricanes and atmospheric heatwaves will be getting stronger in a warming world which would indicate the identified sequence of events that generate these extreme conditions may become more frequent,\" Dzwonkowski said. \"The occurrence of extreme heat content events, like marine heatwaves has significant implications for a broad range of scientific management interests beyond hurricane intensity.\"Importantly, the mechanisms that generated this marine heatwave are expected to be more frequent and intense in the future due to climate change, increasing the likelihood of such extreme conditions.For example, coral reefs and hypoxia-prone shelves are already stressed by long-term warming trends. These temperature-specific benthic communities and habitats are typically of significant societal and economic value. As such, the newly identified sequence of compounding processes is expected to impact a range of coastal interests and should be considered in management and disaster response decisions.This research was funded by the NOAA RESTORE Science Program and NOAA NGI NMFS Regional Collaboration network."}

Researchers observed longer dive durations after the hurricane for turtles that stayed in their pre-storm foraging areas. Some dives lasted an hour or more, compared with less than 30 minutes for a typical dive before the storm.The turtles that left their foraging areas after the hurricane passed moved south earlier than would be expected, based on their normal seasonal movements. This change was also more than a month earlier than the typical seasonal cooling in the water column, which is also when the foraging season for loggerhead turtles ends in the Mid-Atlantic Bight.\"Loggerheads experience environmental changes in the entire water column from the surface to the bottom, including during extreme weather events,\" said Crowe. \"This study was an opportunistic look at turtle behavior during a hurricane. Their behavior makes loggerheads good observers of oceanographic conditions where they forage.\"The study was conducted by researchers at the Northeast Fisheries Science Center and colleagues at the nearby Coonamessett Farm Foundation in East Falmouth, Massachusetts. The team has tagged more than 200 loggerheads in the Mid-Atlantic Bight since 2009.This work has created a continuous time-series of data on loggerhead sea turtles. With 10 years of data, researchers can now get a deeper understanding of how turtles behave and what environmental factors drive them. They can also look back at the data and ask new questions, as they did in this study.Waters in the Mid-Atlantic Bight are highly stratified, or layered, by temperature in the summer. At the surface, water is warm. A cold layer, also called a cold pool, forms beneath this warm layer and is present from May to October. The presence of the cold pool overlaps with the Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from June through November. It also overlaps with the presence of foraging loggerheads that are in the area between May and September.Hurricane modeling is especially difficult in the Mid-Atlantic Bight because of the cold pool. In this study, it was unclear which aspect of the environmental changes prompted behavioral changes. Previous studies have found that loggerhead behavior appears to be sensitive to changes in water temperatures throughout the water column. Hurricanes cause the water layers to mix, which creates cooler surface temperatures. The mixing also disrupts the thermocline -- the boundary layer between warm surface waters and colder, deeper waters.Ocean temperature data recorded by the turtles' satellite tags are consistent with observations from weather buoys and autonomous gliders operating in the region. Depending on how many tags are deployed, data from tagged turtles can cover a more extensive area within a season than other oceanographic data sources.More measurements of water temperatures throughout the water column in the region could help improve oceanographic models. Researchers say data from the turtle tags are an underused resource that has the potential to improve weather models, including hurricane models.Many of the natural and human-induced impacts on sea turtle behavior, or the environments that sea turtles live in, are still unknown.Previous studies indicate that sounds from dredge operations, seismic activity,offshore wind farm development, and marine recreation may also impact sea turtle distribution and dive behavior. Turtles might be impacted directly or through habitat alterations. While studies have looked at how tropical storms and hurricanes affect some marine species, there are few examples of examining sea turtle interactions with large storms.In this study, turtle behavior did not return to pre-storm behavior within 2 weeks after the storm.\"The long-term cumulative effects of a changing climate and the increase in intensity of hurricanes and other storms is something that needs to be looked at. Changes in sea turtle movements and behavior can affect abundance estimates and management decisions,\" Crowe said. \"This study reminds us that turtles live in a dynamic environment, and we cannot assume their behavior will be consistent throughout space and time.\"The study was supported by funds from the Atlantic Marine Assessment Program for Protected Species and the New England/Greater Atlantic Region's Research Set-Aside Program."}

Drones, however, can gather close-up information from a number of angles and viewpoints. It's possible, of course, for first responders to fly drones for damage assessment, but drones are now widely available among residents and routinely flown after natural disasters.\"The number of drone videos available on social media soon after a disaster means they can be a valuable resource for doing timely damage assessments,\" Liang said.Xiaoyu Zhu, a master's student in AI and Innovation in the LTI, said the initial system can overlay masks on parts of the buildings in the video that appear damaged and determine if the damage is slight or serious, or if the building has been destroyed."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_14", "content": "The study, led by the University of Bristol, analysed future projections of hurricane rainfall in the Caribbean and found it to be particularly vulnerable to climate change, resulting in extreme hurricane rainfall events being as much as five times more likely in a warmer world.\"Hurricane research has previously focused on the United States, so we wanted to look at the Caribbean region, which has fewer resources to recover. The findings are alarming and illustrate the urgent need to tackle global warming to reduce the likelihood of extreme rainfall events and their catastrophic consequences, particularly for poorer countries which take many years to recover,\" said lead author Emily Vosper, Research Student at the School of Computer Science, at the University of Bristol.The researchers generated thousands of synthetic hurricanes under three climate scenarios: present day conditions compared to the Paris Agreement goals of 1.5 degrees Celsius and 2Â°C warming above pre-industrial levels. The main objective of the Paris Agreement, a global framework to tackle climate change, is to hold the global average temperature increase to well below 2Â°C above pre-industrial levels and endeavour to limit the temperature increase to 1.5Â°C.Focusing their analysis on the Caribbean region, the study generated rainfall statistics by applying a physics-based model to the synthetic hurricanes. The model takes into account several factors including the land features and large-scale winds, and has been shown to give realistic results compared to observations of real-life hurricanes.The study, published in Hurricane Maria brought as much as a quarter of normal annual rainfall to some regions of Puerto Rico when it made landfall in 2017 and storms of this magnitude are roughly once in a 100-year events. The results show that in a 2Â°C warmer world, an event of similar size to Maria would be more than twice (2.3 times) as likely, occurring once every 43 years. Similarly, a 100-year storm affecting the Bahamas would be 4.5 times as likely under the 2Â°C Paris Agreement scenario compared to the present day. Under the more ambitious goal of 1.5Â°C warming, such extreme hurricane rainfall events affecting the Dominican Republic would occur roughly once every 57 years, which is half as likely compared to the 2Â°C warming scenario where they would occur once every 30 years.Emily said: \"We expected extreme hurricanes to be more prevalent in the 2Â°C global warming scenario, but the scale of the projected increases was surprising and should serve as a stark warning to countries across the globe underscoring the importance of keeping climate change under control.\"The projections reinforce the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change special report, which concludes that restricting global warming to 1.5Â°C would limit the risk of climate-related hazards, such as torrential rainfall, drought, and temperature extremes.Emily said: \"Our findings show that the impacts of a 2Â°C warming above pre-industrial levels are set to disproportionately affect the Caribbean. By focusing efforts to stabilise global warming to the more ambitious 1.5Â°C goal, we could dramatically reduce the likelihood of extreme hurricane rainfall events in the area, particularly in the Eastern Caribbean region.\"It takes at least six years for even the richest of the Caribbean countries to rebuild after a major hurricane hits, stalling economic growth. Building resilient infrastructure throughout the islands is not feasible due to financial and time constraints. The study recommends its findings could be used to inform a multi-hazard, multi-scale approach which identifies the most at-risk areas so resilience funding and strategies can be more effectively targeted.Emily said: \"Resources to mitigate damage are limited, so our findings could help highlight the hotspots in greatest danger and need. An integrated climate risk approach is needed to fully understand the threat of future hurricanes to Caribbean populations.\"Further studies could therefore incorporate factors that directly affect the health and well-being of local populations -- such as storm surge, flood and landslide modelling -- into the rainfall results to quantify such threats and feed into adaptation and resilience planning.\"Reducing the likelihood of extreme hurricanes should be the overriding priority. Our research clearly illustrates how vital it is to keep striving to meet the lower global warming temperature target, and the collective responsibility all countries, cities, communities, governments and individuals share to make that happen.\""}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_15", "content": "\"We were inspired by the fact that the spread of epidemics and pandemics in communities has been studied by people in health sciences and epidemiology and other fields, and they have identified some principles and rules that govern the spread process in complex social networks,\" said Dr. Ali Mostafavi, associate professor in the Zachry Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering. \"So we ask ourselves, are these spreading processes the same for the spread of flooding in cities? We tested that, and surprisingly, we found that the answer is yes.\"The findings of this study were recently published in Nature The contagion model, Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR), is used to mathematically model the spread of infectious diseases. In relation to flooding, Mostafavi and his team integrated the SEIR model with the network spread process in which the probability of flooding of a road segment depends on the degree to which the nearby road segments are flooded.In the context of flooding, susceptible is a road that can be flooded because it is in a flood plain; exposed is a road that has flooding due to rainwater or overflow from a nearby channel; infected is a road that is flooded and cannot be used; and recovered is a road where the floodwater has receded.The research team verified the model's use with high-resolution historical data of road flooding in Harris County during Hurricane Harvey in 2017. The results show that the model can monitor and predict the evolution of flooded roads over time.\"The power of this approach is it offers a simple and powerful mathematical approach and provides great potential to support emergency managers, public officials, residents, first responders and other decision makers for flood forecast in road networks,\" Mostafavi said.The proposed model can achieve decent precision and recall for the spatial spread of the flooded roads.\"If you look at the flood monitoring system of Harris County, it can show you if a channel is overflowing now, but they're not able to predict anything about the next four hours or next eight hours. Also, the existing flood monitoring systems provide limited information about the propagation of flooding in road networks and the impacts on urban mobility. But our models, and this specific model for the road networks, is robust at predicting the future spread of flooding,\" he said. \"In addition to flood prediction in urban networks, the findings of this study provide very important insights about the universality of the network spread processes across various social, natural, physical and engineered systems; this is significant for better modeling and managing cities, as complex systems.\"The only limitation to this flood prediction model is that it cannot identify where the initial flooding will begin, but Mostafavi said there are other mechanisms in place such as sensors on flood gauges that can address this.\"As soon as flooding is reported in these areas, we can use our model, which is very simple compared to hydraulic and hydrologic models, to predict the flood propagation in future hours. The forecast of road inundations and mobility disruptions is critical to inform residents to avoid high-risk roadways and to enable emergency managers and responders to optimize relief and rescue in impacted areas based on predicted information about road access and mobility. This forecast could be the difference between life and death during crisis response,\" he said.Civil engineering doctoral student and graduate research assistant Chao Fan led the analysis and modeling of the Hurricane Harvey data, along with Xiangqi (Alex) Jiang, a graduate student in computer science, who works in Mostafavi's UrbanResilience.AI Lab.\"By doing this research, I realize the power of mathematical models in addressing engineering problems and real-world challenges.This research expands my research capabilities and will have a long-term impact on my career,\" Fan said. \"In addition, I am also very excited that my research can contribute to reducing the negative impacts of natural disasters on infrastructure services.\""}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_16", "content": "The study, published in the journal \"A key finding from this study is that our data showed that the ocean currents in the deepest parts of the South Atlantic Ocean behave differently than we thought before we had this new long-term dataset, which may have large implications for the climate and weather forecasts made by ocean models in the future,\" said Marion Kersale, an oceanographer with the UM Rosenstiel School's Cooperative Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Studies and lead author on the study.The MOC is one of the main components of ocean circulation, which constantly moves heat, salt, carbon, and nutrients throughout the global oceans. Variations of the MOC have important impacts on many global scale climate phenomena such as sea level changes, extreme weather, and precipitation patterns.The MOC consists of an upper cell of warmer, lighter waters that sits on top of colder, denser waters, known as the abyssal cell. These water masses travel around the global ocean, exchanging temperature, salinity, carbon and nutrients along the way.This study provided remarkable insights into the full-depth vertical, horizontal, and temporal resolution of the MOC. A key new result from this study has been the estimation of the strength of the abyssal cell (from 3000 m to the seafloor), which previously have only been available as once-a-decade snapshot estimates from trans-basin ship sections.This study found that the upper layer circulation is more energetic than that in the very deep, or abyssal, layer at all time scales ranging from a few days to a year. The flows in the upper and deep layers of the ocean behave independently of one another which can impact how the entire MOC system influences sea level rise and hurricane intensification in the Atlantic.Research such as the study led by Kersale is helping oceanographers to refine and improve our understanding of the complexities of the MOC system. These observations will allow scientists to validate Earth system models and will aid in UM Rosentiel School and NOAA's goals to improve our understanding of the climate/weather system."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_17", "content": "Researchers led by the University of Iowa have identified a connection between a climate system in East Asia and the frequency of tropical storms that develop in the Atlantic Ocean -- which can strengthen into hurricanes that threaten the United States.In a new study, the researchers say the East Asian Subtropical Jet Stream (EASJ) an upper-level river of wind that originates in East Asia and moves west to east across the globe, carries with it an atmospheric phenomenon called a Rossby wave.Rossby waves occur naturally within the Earth's oceans and atmosphere, forming because of the planet's rotation. The researchers say Rossby waves hitch a ride on the EASJ to the North Atlantic when tropical cyclones in the Atlantic are most likely to form. The waves affect wind shear, a key element in the formation of tropical storms.\"When the EASJ is stronger, it can enhance this pattern, which leads to stronger teleconnections and stronger wind shear in the North Atlantic,\" explains says Wei Zhang, a climate scientist at IIHR-Hydroscience & Engineering at Iowa. \"That can suppress Atlantic tropical cyclone formation.\"The scientists observed nearly 40 years of Atlantic tropical cyclones during prime formation season, from August to November, and their connection during the same time period with EASJ activity between July to October.\"What we found was there is a signal (Rossby waves) in terms of wind shear and that this signal is coming from the west, being Asia, over the Atlantic, via the East Asian Subtropical Jet Stream,\" says Zhang, who is corresponding author on the study, published online in the journal The researchers analyzed various data sets, as well as the database from the National Hurricane Center between 1980 and 2018, to seek patterns associated between tropical cyclones generated in the Atlantic and the EASJ. They determined based on that information that a stronger EASJ is associated with fewer Atlantic tropical cyclones.The study comes as Hurricane Isiaias became the fifth named storm to make landfall in the continental U.S. -- and already the second hurricane to swipe land -- when it swept across the U.S. East Coast last week.The researchers previously found a connection between the EASJ and storms affecting the western U.S. After that study, they looked for other associations.\"We said, 'OK let's see whether this subtropical jet can influence other weather systems,\" says Gabriele Villarini, IIHR's director and a co-author on the study.\"We found a physical mechanism that can provide a basic understanding in the context of tropical cyclone formation,\" Villarini says. \"Then the question becomes, 'OK, now that you know that, what are you going to do with it?'\"He continues: \"That's the part that is not there yet, in the sense of how predictable is the East Asian Subtropical Jet, and how far ahead can we predict it for an entire season, so that it can become a useful tool for predicting tropical cyclone formation in the North Atlantic.\"The researchers also aim to understand how climate change could affect the EASJ, which may contribute to tropical cyclones' frequency in the North Atlantic."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_18", "content": "The 2020 Atlantic hurricane season has been off to a rapid pace with a record-setting nine named storms so far and has the potential to be one of the busiest on record. Historically, only two named storms form on average by early August, and the ninth named storm typically does not form until October 4. An average season produces 12 named storms, including six hurricanes of which three become major hurricanes (Category 3, 4, or 5).\"This is one of the most active seasonal forecasts that NOAA has produced in its 22-year history of hurricane outlooks. NOAA will continue to provide the best possible science and service to communities across the Nation for the remainder of hurricane season to ensure public readiness and safety,\" said U.S. Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross. \"We encourage all Americans to do their part by getting prepared, remaining vigilant, and being ready to take action when necessary.\"The updated outlook calls for 19-25 named storms (winds of 39 mph or greater), of which 7-11 will become hurricanes (winds of 74 mph or greater), including 3-6 major hurricanes (winds of 111 mph or greater). This update covers the entire six-month hurricane season, which ends Nov. 30, and includes the nine named storms to date.A comprehensive measure of the overall hurricane season activity is the Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) index, which measures the combined intensity and duration of all named storms during the season. Based on the ACE projection, combined with the above-average numbers of named storms and hurricanes, the likelihood of an above-normal Atlantic hurricane season has increased to 85%, with only a 10% chance of a near-normal season and a 5% chance of a below-normal season.\"This year, we expect more, stronger, and longer-lived storms than average, and our predicted ACE range extends well above NOAA's threshold for an extremely active season,\" said Gerry Bell, Ph.D., lead seasonal hurricane forecaster at NOAA's Climate Prediction Center.Current oceanic and atmospheric conditions that make an \"extremely active\" hurricane season possible are warmer-than-average sea surface temperatures in the tropical Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea, reduced vertical wind shear, weaker tropical Atlantic trade winds and an enhanced west African monsoon. These conditions are expected to continue for the next several months. A main climate factor behind these conditions is the ongoing warm phase of the Atlantic Multi-Decadal Oscillation, which reappeared in 1995 and has been favoring more active hurricane seasons since that time.Another contributing climate factor this year is the possibility of La Nina developing in the months ahead. Indicative of cooler-than-average sea surface temperatures in the equatorial regions of the eastern Pacific Ocean, La Nina can further weaken the wind shear over the Atlantic Basin, allowing storms to develop and intensify.NOAA's hurricane season outlook is for overall seasonal activity and is not a landfall forecast. Landfalls are largely determined by short-term weather patterns, which are only predictable within about a week of a storm potentially reaching a coastline. NOAA's National Hurricane Center provides tropical weather outlooks out to five days in advance, provides track and intensity forecasts for individual storms, and issues watches and warnings for specific tropical storms, hurricanes and the associated storm surge.\"NOAA has the most highly trained and dedicated forecasters that serve to protect American lives and property. With improved forecast skill, new storm surge products, and new observations, such as GPS Radio Occultation, we are better positioned than ever before to keep Americans out of harm's way,\" said Neil Jacobs, Ph.D., acting NOAA administrator. \"It is now more important than ever to stay informed with our forecasts, have a preparedness plan, and heed guidance from local emergency management officials.\"This hurricane season FEMA encourages residents in hurricane-prone regions to keep COVID-19 in mind when making preparations and during evacuations.

{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_19", "content": "\"In this study we document what we believe to be the first instance of a hurricane causing both heavy rainfall and contributing to multiple instances of fire simultaneously,\" said Alison Nugent, lead author of the study and assistant professor of Atmospheric Sciences in the UH Manoa School of Ocean and Earth Science and Technology (SOEST).A team of UH Manoa and East-West Center scientists analyzed multiple aspects of the storm's meteorology and climatology, the environmental conditions leading up to the storm, and documented the associated societal impacts.They found that land-use characteristics and preceding moisture conditions exacerbated fire hazard, and both fire and rain severity were influenced by the hurricane environment and local topographic features. Conditions at the edge of the storm resulted in dry windy weather conducive to fire, while closer to the storm center, the incredibly moist atmosphere lifted by Hawai'i's mountains brought intense, long-lasting rainfall. The simultaneous occurrence of rain-driven flooding and landslides, strong winds, and multiple fires complicated emergency response.The vulnerability of a population in any given location to the impacts of tropical cyclone hazards is determined by a multitude of interacting factors. Biophysical aspects include distance inland from the coast, terrain slope, coastal ecosystem integrity, and land surface cover. Socioeconomic factors include infrastructure quality, the availability of early warning systems, and capacity for evacuation and emergency response.\"The surprising thing about Hurricane Lane was that, despite never making landfall, the storm caused considerable damage and disruptions across the state from two rather contradictory things: fire and rain,\" said Nugent. \"Severe flooding on the windward island of Hawai'i Island built over several days, and multiple fires initiated on the lee sides of Maui and OÊ»ahu within hours of each other. Hurricane Lane is one of only three documented cases of hurricanes influencing wildland fire risk in real-time.\"In Hawai'i, landfall by hurricanes is relatively rare due to persistent vertical wind shear over the islands, which weakens hurricanes by essentially tipping them over. However, when hurricanes do occur near Hawai'i, the geography of the islands can exacerbate the hazards. The nearly 750 miles of coastline makes much of the state susceptible to coastal flooding, and the mountainous topography can enhance high-intensity rainfall, as well as intensifying wind speeds. In addition, the steep mountainous terrain can enhance flash flooding and trigger landslide events.The study highlights Hawai'i's vulnerability to natural hazards and reveals that these events can place significant constraints on emergency responders. This research also demonstrates UH Manoa's technical expertise across multiple disciplines -- climatology, meteorology, water resources, fire science -- to assess and predict the impacts of natural hazards and other climate-related events.In the future the team plans to develop the analytical approaches and Hawai'i-focused climate products needed to assess and prepare for future impacts, especially in the context of a changing climate where intensity and frequency of extreme events is likely to increase."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_20", "content": "The study also found that the occurrence of tropical cyclones with lower moving speeds and higher total rainfalls became more frequent after 1990 in the Pearl River Delta. The discovery offers invaluable insights that will enable the development of better flood management and adaptation strategies in the coastal region of China which is under threat due to tropical cyclones.The research team led by Dr Li Jianfeng, Assistant Professor of the Department of Geography at HKBU, studied 406 tropical cyclones which made landfall and lasted for more than two days over the coast of China, and specifically the Pearl River Delta where Hong Kong is located, between 1961 and 2017. The study, which started in 2018, aimed to investigate the trend of tropical cyclones' moving speeds and its correlation with the volume of rainfall in the long run.The research team analysed track data of the 406 tropical cyclones from the International Best Track Archive for Climate Stewardship (IBTrACS) and numerical simulations of eight Global Climate Models (GCMs) developed by meteorological and modelling centres around the world. IBTrACS is one of the most commonly used datasets for tropical cyclone studies, while GCMs are important tools for scientific communities to investigate and project climate behaviour.The team found that the observed moving speed of the tropical cyclones underwent a significant drop of 11%, decreasing from 21 km per hour in 1961 to 18.6 km per hour in 2017. The simulated moving speed also showed a drop of 10%, decreasing from 21.2 km per hour to 19.1 km per hour during the same period.Data on the volume of local rainfall brought about by the 406 tropical cyclones was also examined. While the mean total volume of local rainfall increased by 8% between 1961 and 2017, the 90th percentile of the total volume of local rainfall increased even more significantly by 18%, rising from 187 mm to 223 mm. As a result, the data indicated an increase in extreme rainfall caused by tropical cyclones over the 57-year period examined.Using statistical analysis, the team detected a negative correlation between the moving speeds of the tropical cyclones and their volume of local rainfall. The mean volume of local rainfall of slow-moving tropical cyclones with moving speeds of 15 km per hour or below was 99.1 mm, while that of fast-moving tropical cyclones with moving speeds of 25 km per hour or above was 80.5 mm. In other words, slow-moving tropical cyclones brought about 20% more rainfall on average when compared with fast-moving ones.\"The total amount of rainfall over a specific region brought about by a tropical cyclone is directly proportional to rainfall intensity, and inversely proportional to moving speed. The slower a tropical cyclone moves, the longer it spends passing over the region. As the region is affected for a longer duration, slower tropical cyclones bring about more rainfall,\" said Dr Li.The study further examined the correlation between the moving speeds of tropical cyclones and total rainfall in the Pearl River Delta. Among the 147 tropical cyclones that affected the Pearl River Delta between 1961 and 2017, 14 of them were slow-moving and had a rainfall intensity of 30 mm per day or more. Ten of them occurred after 1990, including three with a total volume of rainfall of more than 200 mm, indicating a substantial increase of flood risks caused by slow-moving tropical cyclones in recent years.Among the 406 tropical cyclones examined in this study, 82 affected Hong Kong and moved within 200 km of the city. Out of these 82 tropical cyclones, 22 were slow-moving, and 14 of them (about 64%) occurred after 1990. They include Typhoon York in 1999 and Severe Tropical Storm Goni in 2009 which caused extensive damage in the region.\"With analysis backed by long-term observations, we have provided evidence showing that slower tropical cyclone movement tends to elevate rainfall volume and thus it imposes greater flood risks at a regional scale. Therefore, more holistic and integrated flood risk management strategies, as well as flexible adaptation options, will be needed to deal with the growing threat of floods,\" said Dr Li.The research findings were published in the  scientific journal Apart from HKBU researchers, the research team also comprised researchers from Shenzhen University, China University of Geosciences, The Chinese University of Hong Kong (Shenzhen), University of Alberta, and Princeton University."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_21", "content": "The study published online July 3 in The research began in Houston as Harvey deluged the city with 30-40 inches of rain over five days. Rice University researchers riding out the storm began collaborating with colleagues from Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory (LDEO) and Harvard University to explore whether climate change would increase the likelihood of slow-moving rainmakers like Harvey.\"We find that the probability of having strong northward steering winds will increase with climate change, meaning hurricanes over Texas will be more likely to move like Ike than Harvey,\" said study lead author Pedram Hassanzadeh of Rice.Harvey caused an estimated $125 billion in damage, matching 2005's Katrina as the costliest hurricane in U.S. history. Ike was marked by coastal flooding and high winds that caused $38 billion damage across several states. It was the second-costliest U.S. hurricane at the time and has since moved to sixth. Ike struck Galveston around 2 a.m. Sept. 13, 2008, crossed Texas in less than one day and caused record power outages from Arkansas to Ohio on Sept. 14.Hassanzadeh, a fluid dynamicist, atmospheric modeler and assistant professor of both mechanical engineering and Earth, environmental and planetary sciences, said the findings don't suggest that slow-moving storms like Harvey won't happen in late 21st century. Rather, they suggest that storms during the period will be more likely to be fast-moving than slow-moving. The study found the chances that a Texas hurricane will be fast-moving as opposed to slow-moving will rise by about 50% in the last quarter of the 21st century compared with the final quarter of the 20th century.\"These results are very interesting, given that a previous study that considered the Atlantic basin as a whole noticed a trend for slower-moving storms in the past 30 years,\" said study co-author Suzana Camargo, LDEO's Marie Tharp Lamont Research Professor. \"By contrast, our study focused on changes at the end of the 21st century and shows that we need to consider much smaller regional scales, as their trends might differ from the average across much larger regions.\"Hassanzadeh said the researchers used more than a dozen different computer models to produce several hundred simulations and found that \"all of them agreed on an increase in northward steering winds over Texas.\"Steering winds are strong currents in the lower 10 kilometers of the atmosphere that move hurricanes.\"It doesn't happen a lot, in studying the climate system, that you get such a robust regional signal in wind patterns,\" he said.Harvey was the first hurricane Hassanzadeh experienced. He'd moved to Houston the previous year and was stunned by the slow-motion destruction that played out as bayous, creeks and rivers in and around the city topped their banks.\"I was sitting at home watching, just looking at the rain when (study co-author) Laurence (Yeung) emailed a bunch of us, asking 'What's going on? Why is this thing not moving?'\" Hassanzadeh recalled. \"That got things going. People started replying. That's the good thing about being surrounded by smart people. Laurence got us started, and things took off.\"Yeung, an atmospheric chemist, Hassanzadeh and two other Rice professors on the original email, atmospheric scientist Dan Cohan and flooding expert Phil Bedient, won one of the first grants from Rice's Houston Engagement and Recovery Effort (HERE), a research fund Rice established in response to Harvey.\"Without that, we couldn't have done this work,\" Hassanzadeh said. The HERE grant allowed Rice co-author Ebrahim Nabizadeh, a graduate student in mechanical engineering, to work for several months, analyzing the first of hundreds of computer simulations based on large-scale climate models.The day Harvey made landfall, Hassanzadeh also had reached out to Columbia's Chia-Ying Lee, an expert in both tropical storms and climate downscaling, procedures that use known information at large scales to make projections at local scales. Lee and Camargo used information from the large-scale simulations to make a regional model that simulated storms' tracks over Texas in a warming climate.\"One challenge of studying the impact of climate change on hurricanes at a regional level is the lack of data,\" said Lee, a Lamont Assistant Research Professor at LDEO. \"At Columbia University, we have developed a downscaling model that uses physics-based statistics to connect large-scale atmospheric conditions to the formation, movement and intensity of hurricanes. The model's physical basis allowed us to account for the impact of climate change, and its statistical features allowed us to simulate a sufficient number of Texas storms.\"Hassanzadeh said, \"Once we found that robust signal, where all the models agreed, we thought, 'There should be a robust mechanism that's causing this.'\"He reached out to tropical climate dynamicist Ding Ma of Harvard to get another perspective.\"We were able to show that changes in two important processes were joining forces and resulting in the strong signal from the models,\" said Ma, a postdoctoral researcher in Earth and planetary sciences.One of the processes was the Atlantic subtropical high, or Bermuda high, a semipermanent area of high pressure that forms over the Atlantic Ocean during the summer, and the other was the North American monsoon, an uptick in rainfall and thunderstorms over the southwestern U.S. and northwestern Mexico that typically occurs between July and September. Hassanzadeh said recent studies have shown that each of these are projected to change as Earth's climate warms.\"The subtropical high is a clockwise circulation to the east that is projected to intensify and shift westward, producing more northward winds over Texas,\" he said. \"The North American monsoon, to the west, produces a clockwise circulation high in the troposphere. That circulation is expected to weaken, resulting in increased, high-level northward winds over Texas.\"Hassanzadeh said the increased northward winds from both east and west \"gives you a strong reinforcing effect over the whole troposphere, up to about 10 kilometers, over Texas. This has important implications for the movement of future Texas hurricanes.\"Models showed that the effect extended into western Louisiana, but the picture became murkier as the researchers looked further east, he said.\"You don't have the robust signal like you do over Texas,\" Hassanzadeh said. \"If you look at Florida, for instance, there's a lot of variation in the models. This shows how important it is to conduct studies that focus on climate impacts in specific regions. If we had looked at all of North America, for example, and tried to average over the whole region, we would have missed this localized mechanism over Texas.\""}

{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_23", "content": "Of those 31 million people, about 8.5 million directly benefit from the severe weather-protection of mangroves and coral reefs, key buffers that could help cushion the blow against future tropical storms and rising waters, according to the study published May 29 in the peer-reviewed journal Because the two \"natural infrastructures\" absorb wave energy, reduce wave heights and provide a host of other environmental benefits, the study findings underscore the need for worldwide conservation and restoration of these natural resources. A particular focus, the authors said, should be placed on the most vulnerable regions, which lack available resources for more expensive protective measures, such as construction of levees or sea walls.\"Simply put, it's much cheaper to conserve a mangrove than to build a sea wall,\" said Northern Illinois University scientist Holly Jones, the study's lead author.A 100-meter-wide coastal strip of mangroves can reduce wave heights by as much as two-thirds, previous research has shown. Coral reefs meanwhile buffer wave energy by up to 97% in some contexts, significantly reducing erosion and cutting flood-damage costs in half annually.\"Coral reefs and mangroves serve as cost-efficient buffers against the adverse impacts of climate change, and they already play important roles in protecting human lives and livelihoods, while providing a multitude of biodiversity benefits,\" said Jones, who holds a joint appointment at NIU in biological sciences and environmental studies.Her co-authors on the research are Barry Nickel and Erika Zavaleta of the University of California, Santa Cruz; Tanja Srebotnjak of Harvey Mudd College in Claremont, California; and Will Turner, Mariano Gonzalez-Roglich and David G. Hole of Conservation International in Arlington, Virginia.The study aimed to identify highly vulnerable coastal regions that would benefit most from \"ecosystem-based adaptation,\" or using conservation, restoration and sustainable management of existing ecosystems to address climate impacts.Regions meeting study criteria for \"highly vulnerable\" were within two miles of coastline and scored in the top 10th percentile of the authors' vulnerability index for being highly exposed to the effects of tropical storms and/or sea-level rise, dense in population and low in \"adaptive capacity.\" The authors developed the adaptive-capacity measure to take into account economic data, education levels and other factors that play into a region's ability to adjust to climate variability.The authors found that 30.9 million people globally live in regions that are most vulnerable to tropical storms and projected sea-level rise.\"Our estimate is very conservative,\" Jones said. \"This population lives in regions in the top 10th percentile for vulnerability. If we apply our model to coastal regions that scored in the top half for vulnerability, the population soars to over 700 million people.\"Highly vulnerable, coastal regions that would benefit the most from the conservation of mangroves and coral reefs span across Central America, the Caribbean, Eastern Africa, Southeast Asia and the South Pacific region. And yet only 38% of mangroves and 11% of coral reefs located along the most vulnerable coastlines are protected, according to the study.\"Protection of mangroves and coral reefs is critical,\" said Will Turner, study co-author and senior vice president of global strategies at Conservation International. \"They have the potential to save lives, store carbon and support fisheries; the co-benefits they provide are great. At Conservation International, we're working with local communities, carbon finance, governments and the insurance industry to ensure that generations will benefit from the protection and restoration of these ecosystems.\"The authors noted that many of the world's coastal zones already bear the brunt of extreme weather. Events such as Hurricane Dorian in the Bahamas and hurricanes Maria, Harvey and Irma in the United States and the Caribbean claimed thousands of lives and generated financial costs running into hundreds of billions of dollars.Additionally, past research indicates that the loss of lives and assets in coastal zones is likely to increase significantly as a result of demographic and socio-economic trends alone, leading to a doubling or more of hurricane damages by 2100.Coastlines in Florida and the U.S. island territories of Puerto Rico and Guam also stand to benefit from mangrove and coral reef conservation and restoration.Globally, the densest populations receiving adaptation benefits (people protected per hectare) from mangroves are in India, the United States and Ghana, the study found. The greatest amount of people protected per hectare of coral reefs are in South Africa, Singapore, China and the United States.More than a billion coastal dwellers worldwide face some degree of vulnerability to climate change. While most coastal regions are outside of tropical zones and aren't buffered by mangroves or coral reefs, other ecosystems such as wetlands, estuaries and seagrasses provide protective benefits, Jones said.\"The United States is a wealthy country and has more ability to adapt than other countries, but it still could see significant benefits from conservation and restoration of existing natural infrastructure,\" Jones said. \"Coastal ecosystems reduce the proportion of vulnerable people and infrastructure along exposed U.S. coastlines by around half through their absorption of wave energy.\"The study authors also pointed to other benefits of natural infrastructures, which provide habitats for a host of marine and terrestrial animals and create recreation and tourism opportunities. In the most vulnerable coastal regions alone, mangroves store at least 896 million metric tons of carbon.\"Ensuring the resiliency of mangroves is a win-win-win for people, nature and the climate,\" said Dave Hole, co-author of the study and senior director within Conservation International's Betty and Gordon Moore Center for Science.\"Mangroves store more carbon than any other forest ecosystem on Earth, drawing CO2 down from the atmosphere and storing it for decades, and so helping slow global warming,\" he said. \"As interest in ecosystem-based adaptation continues to grow, it's vital that its multiple co-benefits are part of the conversation.\"The authors noted that their global study provides \"a coarse approximation\" of threats and of regions of the world that might benefit most from ecosystem-based adaptation.Despite mounting interest in ecosystem-based adaptation, implementation has mostly been in the form of site-specific projects. What's needed next, the authors said, is systematic assessment of the broader potential, analyses of the ways in which ecosystem protection varies from site to site, and further investment in conservation and restoration.\"It's a relatively new option that's gaining more traction,\" Jones said. \"Beyond engineering solutions, there are these ecosystems that have been providing benefits to us for centuries. They're worthy of our attention and resources.\""}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_24", "content": "A study led by Dr Marji Puotinen from the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS) sounds a warning about the way strong cyclone winds build extreme seas that affect coral reefs in Australia and around the world.Conventional modelling used to predict how a cyclone, hurricane or typhoon might impact corals assumes that wave damage occurs primarily within 100 kilometres of its track.To test this, Dr Puotinen and colleagues looked at Scott Reef, a well-studied atoll reef structure off the northwest of Western Australia, and how it fared as a result of Cyclone Lua -- a slow-moving weather event that developed off the coast in 2012.Although the area of the cyclone producing the most intense winds came no closer than 500 kilometres to the reef, the high seas it whipped up battered it with waves four to 20 metres high for three and a half days.The researchers found that at its most exposed sections, Scott Reef lost 50 per cent of its massive and robust Porites corals and virtually all its more fragile branching Acropora coral species. Similar damage was found on another reef, a further 300 kilometres distant, and models predicted damaging waves could be felt up to 1000 kilometres away.\"This example demonstrates that if we assume damage from all cyclones occurs within a 100 kilometre radius of a cyclone's track, we will underestimate the spatial extent for big, strong cyclones by up to 10 times,\" Dr Puotinen said.\"This could lead to making unfortunate choices when trying to prioritise conservation targets.\"She added that estimates of wave damage from cyclones involve highly complex calculations because they change constantly, varying in strength, size and speed over time. The largest waves occur from storms that move slowly, and have the highest winds spread over the largest area.To test the consequences of using the standard distance-based model, she and colleagues -- from the AIMS node in Perth, the University of Western Australia and the Indian Ocean Marine Research Centre -- collected existing information on cyclone size and frequency, crunching data gathered between 1985 and 2015 for 150 coral reef ecoregions around the world.Position and strength and size for each cyclone was recorded every six hours, allowing variations to be plotted in detail.They found that more than 70 per cent of the ecoregions had experienced at least one impact by a cyclone at peak strength and size during the 30-year period. Some, however, experienced them roughly every five years, and others roughly every 10.\"Coral reefs have been living with cyclones for millions of years,\" said Dr Puotinen. \"But recovery after a big battering is a slow process, which can take a decade or more. This means that many coral reefs around the world will not have time to fully regrow before the next cyclone hits.\"Climate change models present a complex picture for cyclones. The total number occurring in any given period may well not increase -- but that's not necessarily good news for vulnerable reefs.\"Changes in the atmosphere mean it will be harder for cyclones to form in the first place, but warmer ocean water, which fuels their intensity, means it will be easier for them to strengthen once they do,\" Dr Puotinen explained.She added that her team's findings carry lessons for reef management and conservation strategies.\"When deciding where on the Great Barrier Reef, for instance, to invest millions of dollars to repair or enhance reefs, you don't want to select a location likely to be regularly battered by cyclone waves,\" she said.\"Our research should make it easier for reef managers to choose between candidate reefs.\"Dr James Gilmour, also from AIMS, a co-author on the paper, said the findings illustrated the complexity and severity of the threats facing reefs around the world.\"Coral reef communities around the world are under increasing threat from a range of stressors, and we must understand which parts of the reef should be the focus of conservation efforts,\" he said.\"In particular, it is the combination of cyclones with exposure to rising water temperatures that is the most significant emerging threat to reefs globally.\"Unravelling the specific effects of cyclones, the researchers conclude, will provide vital clues for the management of at-risk areas."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_25", "content": "A warming planet may be fueling the increase.\"Through modeling and our understanding of atmospheric physics, the study agrees with what we would expect to see in a warming climate like ours,\" says James Kossin, a NOAA scientist based at UW-Madison and lead author of the paper, which is published today (May 18, 2020) in the The research builds on Kossin's previous work, published in 2013, which identified trends in hurricane intensification across a 28-year data set. However, says Kossin, that timespan was less conclusive and required more hurricane case studies to demonstrate statistically significant results.To increase confidence in the results, the researchers extended the study to include global hurricane data from 1979-2017. Using analytical techniques, including the CIMSS Advanced Dvorak Technique that relies on infrared temperature measurements from geostationary satellites to estimate hurricane intensity, Kossin and his colleagues were able to create a more uniform data set with which to identify trends.\"The main hurdle we have for finding trends is that the data are collected using the best technology at the time,\" says Kossin. \"Every year the data are a bit different than last year, each new satellite has new tools and captures data in different ways, so in the end we have a patchwork quilt of all the satellite data that have been woven together.\"Kossin's previous research has shown other changes in hurricane behavior over the decades, such as where they travel and how fast they move. In 2014, he identified poleward migrations of hurricanes, where tropical cyclones are travelling farther north and south, exposing previously less-affected coastal populations to greater risk.In 2018, he demonstrated that hurricanes are moving more slowly across land due to changes in Earth's climate. This has resulted in greater flood risks as storms hover over cities and other areas, often for extended periods of time.\"Our results show that these storms have become stronger on global and regional levels, which is consistent with expectations of how hurricanes respond to a warming world,\" says Kossin. \"It's a good step forward and increases our confidence that global warming has made hurricanes stronger, but our results don't tell us precisely how much of the trends are caused by human activities and how much may be just natural variability.\"This work was supported by NOAA Oceanic and Atmospheric Research Climate Program Office."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_26", "content": "After decades of research, meteorologists still have questions about how hurricanes develop. Now, Florida State University researchers have found that even the smallest changes in atmospheric conditions could trigger a hurricane, information that will help scientists understand the processes that lead to these devastating storms.\"The whole motivation for this paper was that we still don't have that universal theoretical understanding of exactly how tropical cyclones form, and to really be able to forecast that storm-by-storm, it would help us to have that more solidly taken care of,\" said Jacob Carstens, a doctoral student in the Department of Earth, Ocean and Atmospheric Science.The research by Carstens and Assistant Professor Allison Wing has been published in the Current theories on the formation of hurricanes agree that some sort of disturbance must exist to start the process that leads to a hurricane. Carstens used numerical models that started with simple conditions to better understand exactly how those disturbances arise.\"We're trying to go as bare bones as possible, looking at just how exactly clouds want to organize themselves without any of these external factors playing into it to form a tropical cyclone more efficiently,\" he said. \"It's a way we can further round out our broader understanding and look more purely at the actual tropical cyclones themselves rather than the surrounding environment's impact on it.\"The simulations started with mostly uniform conditions spread across the imaginary box where the model played out. Then, researchers added a tiny amount of random temperature fluctuations to kickstart the model and observed how the simulated clouds evolved.Despite the random start to the simulation, the clouds didn't stay randomly arranged. They formed into clusters as the water vapor, thermal radiation and other factors interacted. As the clusters circulated through the simulated atmosphere, the researchers tracked when they formed hurricanes. They repeated the model at simulated latitudes between 0.1 degrees and 20 degrees north, representative of areas such as parts of western Africa, northern South America and the Caribbean. That range includes the latitudes where tropical cyclones typically form, along with latitudes very close to the equator where their formation is rare and less studied.The scientists found that every simulation in latitudes between 10 and 20 degrees produced a major hurricane, even from the stable conditions under which they began the simulation. These came a few days after a vortex first emerged well above the surface and affected its surrounding environment.They also showed the possibility of cloud interaction contributing to the development of a tropical cyclone very close to the equator, which rarely occurs in nature but has still been observed as close as 1.4 degrees north away.Hurricanes are dangerous weather events. Forecasting can help prevent deaths, but a big storm can still cause billions of dollars in damage. A better theoretical understanding of their formation will help meteorologists predict and prepare for these storms, both in short-term forecasts and long-term climate projections, and communicate their understanding to the public.\"It's becoming ever more important in our field that we connect with emergency managers, the general population and other local officials to advise them on what they can expect, how they should prepare and what sorts of impacts are going to be heading their way,\" Carstens said. \"A more robust understanding of how tropical cyclones form can help us to better forecast their location, their track and their intensity. It really goes down the line and helps us to communicate sooner as well as more efficiently and eloquently to the public that really needs it.\"This research was supported by the National Science Foundation."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_27", "content": "In fact, a new study by researchers at the Yale School of Forestry & Environmental Studies finds that local economic impacts -- such as damage to factories and production facilities -- can trigger secondary impacts across the city's production and trade network. For the largest storms, they report, these impacts can account for as much as three-fourths of the total damage.According to their findings, published in the journal \"Cities are strongly connected by flows of people, of energy, and ideas -- but also by the flows of trade and materials,\" said Chris Shughrue '18 Ph.D., lead author of the study which is based on his dissertation work at Yale. He is now a data scientist at StreetCred Labs in New York. \"These connections have implications for vulnerability, particularly as we anticipate cyclones and other natural hazards to become more intense and frequent as a result of climate change over the coming decades.\"The paper was co-authored by Karen Seto, a professor of geography and urbanization science at F&ES, and B.T. Werner, a professor from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography.\"This study is especially important in the context of climate impacts on urban areas,\" Seto said. \"Whereas we tend to consider a city's vulnerability to climate change as limited to local events, this study shows that we need to rethink this conceptualization. It shows that disasters have a domino effect through urban networks.\"Using a simulation coupled with a global urban trade network model -- which maps the interdependencies of cities worldwide -- the researchers show how simulated disasters in one location can trigger a catastrophic domino effect.The global spread of damage was particularly acute when cyclones occurred in cities of North America and East Asia, largely because of their outsize role in global trade networks -- as purchasers and suppliers, respectively -- and because these regions are particularly susceptible to cyclone events.Often, adverse impacts are primarily caused by a spike in material prices, followed by production losses to purchasers. These production losses eventually can cause industrial shortages, which can then induce additional cycles of price spikes and shortages throughout the production chain.Similar outcomes have been borne out following real world disasters. For instance, when catastrophic flooding occurred in Queensland, Australia, the impact on coking coal production prompted a 25-percent spike in the global costs. And the economic impacts of Hurricane Katrina extended far beyond New Orleans for several years after the historic storm.While the example of cyclones can act as a proxy for other isolated disasters -- such as the 2011 tsunami in Japan which caused global economic disruptions, particularly in the auto sector -- the researchers say the findings are particularly relevant in terms of climate-related natural events.\"To be resilient to climate change is not only about building dikes and sea walls, but understanding a city's supply chains and how they are linked to other cities that may be vulnerable,\" Seto said."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_28", "content": "Zhang, a postdoctoral research associate in atmospheric and oceanic sciences, decided to tackle the question by using a large ensemble of climate simulations. He worked with an international team of researchers from the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory on Princeton University's Forrestal campus and the Meteorological Research Institute in Tsukuba, Japan. The results of this work appear in the April 22 issue of Science Advances.Zhang and his colleagues selected six potential warming patterns for the global climate, then ran 15 different possible initial conditions on each of the six patterns, resulting in an ensemble of 90 possible futures. In all 90 simulations, they told the computers to assume that global carbon dioxide levels have quadrupled and the planet's average temperature has risen by about 4 degrees Celsius -- a level of warming that experts predict could be reached before the turn of the century, if no action is taken to curb fossil fuel use.\"Our simulations suggest that future anthropogenic warming could lead to a significant slowing of hurricane motion, particularly in some populated mid-latitude regions,\" Zhang said. His team found about the storms' forward motion would slow by about 2 miles per hour -- about 10 to 20% of the current typical speeds -- at latitudes near Japan and New York City.\"This is the first study we are aware of that combines physical interpretation and robust modeling evidence to show that future anthropogenic warming could lead to a significant slowing of hurricane motion,\" he said.\"Since the occurrence of Hurricane Harvey, there has been a huge interest in the possibility that anthropogenic climate change has been contributing to a slow down in the movement of hurricanes,\" said Suzana Camargo, the Marie Tharp Lamont Research Professor at Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, who was not involved in this research. \"In a new paper, Gan Zhang and collaborators examined the occurrence of a slowdown of tropical cyclones in climate model simulations. They showed that in this model, there is a robust slowdown of tropical cyclone motion, but this occurs mainly in the mid-latitudes, not in the tropics.\"Why would the storms slow down? The researchers found that 4 degrees of warming would cause the westerlies -- strong currents blowing through the midlatitudes -- to push toward the poles. That shift is also accompanied by weaker mid-latitude weather perturbations. These changes could slow down storms near populated areas in Asia (where these storms are called typhoons or cyclones, not hurricanes) and on the U.S. eastern seaboard.Usually when people talk about hurricane speeds, they're referring to the winds whipping around the eye of the storm. Those wind speeds are what determine a storm's strength -- a Category 5 hurricane, for example, has sustained winds of more than 157 miles per hour. By contrast, Zhang and his colleagues are looking at the \"translational motion,\" sometimes called the \"forward speed\" of a storm, the speed at which a hurricane moves along its path. (The term comes from geometry, where a figure is \"translated\" when it slides from one part of a graph to another.) No matter how fast its winds are, a storm is considered \"slow-moving\" if its translational speed is low. Hurricane Dorian, which battered Grand Bahama Island from Sept. 1 to 3, 2019, was a Category 5 hurricane with wind gusts reaching 220 miles per hour, but it had a translational speed of just 1.3 mph, making it one of the slowest hurricanes ever documented.Some researchers have suggested that tropical storm translation speeds have slowed over land regions in the United States since 1900. Zhang and his colleagues used their climate models to see if human-caused warming was responsible for the observed slowdown, but they couldn't find a compelling link, at least based on trends since 1950 in their simulations. In addition, they noted that observed slowing translational speeds reported in recent studies could arise primarily from natural variability rather than human-caused climate changes.Zhang used the metaphor of dieting to explain the ambiguity of hurricane observations.\"If I go to the gym and eat fewer sweets,\" he said, \"I would expect to lose weight. But if I'm only using a bathroom scale to weigh myself, I'm not going to get convincing data very soon, for many reasons including that my bathroom scale isn't the most accurate,\" he continued. \"Assume after two weeks, I see some weak trend,\" he said. \"I still can't tell whether it's due to exercise, diet or just randomness.\"Similarly, the observed slowdown trend in hurricanes or tropical storms over the past century could be due to small-scale local changes or could just be random, he said.\"In the debate between 'Everything is caused by climate change' and 'Nothing is caused by climate change' -- what we are doing here is trying to offer that maybe not everything can be immediately attributed to climate change, but the opposite is not right, either,\" Zhang said. \"We do offer some evidence that there could be a slowdown of translational motion in response to a future warming on the order of 4 degrees Celsius. Our findings are backed by physics, as captured by our climate models, so that's a new perspective that offers more confidence than we had before.\""}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_29", "content": "\"Conflicts and disasters, and the social isolation that often follows, have a major impact on healthcare and lead to delays in the diagnosis and treatment of cancers,\" says Tohoku University's Yasuhiro Miki, who specializes in disaster obstetrics and gynecology.On March 11, 2011, Miyagi Prefecture in eastern Japan experienced a 9.0 magnitude earthquake, followed by a destructive tsunami that affected its coastal areas. Miki and colleagues at Tohoku University, led by disaster scientist Kiyoshi Ito, examined how the earthquake affected cervical cancer screening rates in Miyagi Prefecture.Across Japan, approximately 15 women per 100,000 people are affected by cervical cancer. This rate is higher than that in countries such as the US (6.5) and South Korea (8.4), and similar to that in India (14.7) and the Philippines (14.9). Also, less than 1% of girls in Japan have received the human papillomavirus vaccine, which protects against cervical cancer. This means that cervical cancer screening is of particular importance for early detection and diagnosis. Even so, cervical cancer screening rates are lower in Japan (42.3% of women aged 20-69) compared to other countries (80% in the US and the UK, for example).In the five years after the 2011 disaster, cervical cancer screenings dropped by more than 3% in four areas of Miyagi Prefecture covered by mobile van testing. In the coastal city of Onagawa, for example, cervical cancer screening dropped 7% following the disaster. While rates improved slightly over the years, they were still 6.9% lower in 2016 compared to pre-earthquake levels. Similar trends, though less severe, were found in other areas of the prefecture; with rates significantly lower in coastal areas compared to non-coastal ones.\"Cervical cancer screening is essential for maintaining good health, but in many affected areas, the rates markedly decreased in the year following the earthquake,\" says Miki. \"More problematically, the decline in cervical cancer screening rates did not even recover in some areas five years after the earthquake.\"The issue is not specific to Japan. Researchers in the US had previously observed fewer women were diagnosed with cervical cancer in areas affected by Hurricane Katrina in the five years following 2005, compared to the five years preceding it. Those diagnosed also had more advanced disease, suggesting that the cervical cancer screening services were not being fully utilized.\"Long term monitoring of women's health is needed after a disaster,\" Miki says. \"Measures need to be taken to restore screening rates in all affected areas.\"The team recommends further studies to understand why screening rates were affected more in some areas compared to others."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_30", "content": "\"Up to now, the focus on damage to forests has been on catastrophic wind speeds. Here, the data show that rain tends to be the greatest risk factor,\" said Jazlynn Hall, a Columbia University PhD. student who led the study. Her team identified several ways in which extreme rain might topple trees, but they do not completely understand the phenomenon yet, she said. She said that adding in climate-driven extreme rainfall to the various dangers threatening tropical and subtropical forests suggests that they may store less carbon in the future than previously thought.When Irma arrived off Puerto Rico on Sept. 6, 2017, it was then the most powerful Atlantic hurricane ever recorded. (Dorian, two years later, surpassed it.) But the main storm passed well off the coast; it dumped a foot of rain, but spared the island the heaviest winds. Forests suffered little damage. Then, two weeks later, on Sept, 20, Maria hit directly, with sustained winds of up to 130 miles per hour, and an astonishing 5 feet of rain over 48 hours in some areas.Extrapolating from a combination of satellite imagery and on-the-ground surveys made a year before the hurricanes, and repeated shortly after, the researchers say that in the wake of Maria, some 10.4 billion tons of Puerto Rico's tree biomass went down, with trunks snapped off, uprooted or stripped of leaves and branches -- 23 percent of the island's pre-hurricane forest. But the damage was not uniform, and the researchers sorted through various risk factors that might account for differences.Conventional wisdom has it that big trees high up on slopes directly exposed to high winds should suffer the most in storms. Indeed, the researchers did find that canopy height was an overarching factor; they confirmed earlier research showing that the island's biggest trees were prime victims. After that, conventional wisdom dissolved. Drilling down past tree height, the scientists found that the next most important factors were the amount of rain a specific locality got, plus the maximum local sustained wind speeds. Underlying those: the amount of antecedent rain from Irma, plus the amount of water that could be stored in the first five feet or so of soil from both storms. Adding it all up, the researchers concluded that rain, and its resulting storage in soil, dominated in determining which locales suffered the worst damage. Slope, elevation, topographic protection from wind and orientation toward the wind turned out to be the weakest factors.\"It's surprising, in the sense that when you think about hurricane damage to forests, you think about wind,\" said Hall's advisor and paper coauthor Maria Uriarte, a professor at Columbia's Earth Institute. \"We're very aware of what flooding does to human infrastructure, but not so much to natural ecosystems.\" Uriarte led a series of prior studies on the storms, including one last year suggesting that forests in the paths of increasingly powerful and frequent hurricanes may eventually go into permanent decline.The researchers say extreme rain potentially could affect trees in multiple ways. For one, in relatively flat areas where soils are porous and have a high capacity to store water for extended periods, Irma probably pre-loaded the dirt with liquid. When Maria came along, the ground around tree root zones became waterlogged. This theoretically would weaken the soil and make it easier for wind to uproot trees.In addition to uprooting, the researchers also found that many trees in high-damage areas instead suffered snapped trunks. This, Hall speculated, could happen because rain simultaneously increases the weight of the soil and a tree's canopy, exerting increased strain on the trunk in the face of high winds. A heavier canopy could also contribute to uprooting by simply making it easier for the tree to tip over in saturated soil, she said. Counterintuitively, trees growing on slopes might in many cases resist damage better, because soils there might drain more quickly than those in low-lying areas that are protected from wind, but which collect more rainfall.\"The protective role of topography may be lessened in storms of Hurricane Maria's magnitude, which may foreshadow similar effects in future intense storms,\" says the paper. \"Our study supports the idea that compounded disturbances can interact in ways that cannot be predicted.\"Hurricanes derive their strength from heated air, and previous studies have projected that, due to warming climate, wind speeds of North Atlantic hurricanes may increase by 6 to 15 percent by 2100. Perhaps more salient in light of the new study: Warmer air also pulls in more moisture, and current models project that rainfall will increase even more drastically -- 20-plus percent. Added to that, hurricanes may stall over land for increased times, meaning that rainfall will not be more intense, but last longer. This was what caused 2017's Hurricane Harvey to devastate southeast Texas with the wettest recorded tropical cyclone ever to hit the United States.A study last year by other researchers says that things may be heading this way already. It estimates that trends in sea-surface temperatures over the last 60 years have made the probability of Hurricane Maria-scale precipitation five times more likely. In addition, intervals between high-rain storms like Irma and Maria have already decreased by 50 percent, hiking up the possibility of the sequence that took place in 2017.Tropical forests are now absorbing a third less carbon from the air than they did in the 1990s, according to a study out last week. The main reasons right now are burning and logging of trees, higher temperatures and droughts. But if the new study holds up, in some places it may not be the fire next time, but water."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_31", "content": "Usually, in rivers, large flooding events move from upstream to downstream faster than small events. This study identified a different model by tracking flooding events as moved from the river to the coastal ocean. The river delta, which is common in many natural systems, turned out to be very important for understanding when and where flooding is likely to happen.Using years of observations (in some cases 9 decades of data), this study found that the Tombigbee-Alabama Delta (also known as the Mobile-Tensaw Delta) delays and reduces flooding for cities along the delta and bay. Amazingly, this effect is largely caused by the vegetation that naturally occurs in the delta.Most of the delta is a densely packed tupelo-bald cypress swamp, supporting the most biodiverse location in temperate North America. For large events, the delta swamp acts like a sponge quickly absorbing the initial floodwaters, and then slowly releases the water back to the main rivers. This gives communities more time to prepare and reduces the risk of river flooding overlapping with a storm surge during a hurricane. The slower release of water from the delta also slows the impact on the bay, delaying the initial flushing while also keeping the salinity low for a longer period of time. In contrast, smaller flooding events moved downstream faster. This occurs because smaller flooding events remain in the confines of the river channel, where they are not impacted by the swamps of the delta.These findings indicate the intensity of coastal flooding can be decreased and provide more time to prepare by allowing inland regions of rivers to flood and/or by managing vegetation type, both of which reduce the downstream height of water."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_32", "content": "In the most comprehensive study of its sort to date, UC San Diego economists show that U.S. counties with more wetlands experienced substantially less property damage from hurricanes and tropical storms over a recent 20-year period than those with fewer wetlands.A major focus of the study is estimating the monetary value of wetlands' property-protecting services. On average, the marginal value of one square kilometer of wetlands is estimated at $1.8 million per year. The study also finds there is considerable spatial variation in the value of wetlands' protective services, with their value in heavily populated areas that are at frequent risk of being hit by major storms often being considerably higher.The paper, titled \"Coastal wetlands reduce property damage during tropical cyclones,\" is published in the Richard Carson, a professor in the UC San Diego Department of Economics, is the senior author and recent doctoral alumna Fanglin Sun, now a researcher at Amazon, is the first author.\"Wetlands play a critical role in helping to reduce property damage from storms. With coastal areas under increasing threat from more powerful storms due to climate change, it's critical to prevent further destruction of existing wetlands,\" Carson said. \"Government should also actively seek to restore wetlands that have been lost.\"To arrive at their calculations, the co-authors analyzed the effects all tropical cyclones on the Atlantic and Gulf coasts between 1996 and 2016: 88 hurricanes and tropical storms that hit 232 U.S. counties.They worked with precise storm tracks and used highly detailed geo-spatial data -- enabling them to make estimates at not just the county level but down to the neighborhood too -- taking into account a number of factors, including property values and local elevation, as well as building codes. The relative protection from wetlands is greatest, it turns out, in areas with the weakest building codes.They studied freshwater and saltwater wetlands, as well as forested wetlands (or mangroves) and scrub/shrub wetlands. All types of wetlands, they find, contribute significantly to reductions in property damage from storms.The co-authors say their model can be used to estimate property damage both under different climate-change conditions and under different scenarios of wetland loss, too. To illustrate the latter, they apply their model to Hurricane Irma, which made landfall in 2017, just outside the study's sample period. If the 19 Florida counties affected by the storm had not lost 2.8% of their wetland coverage between 1996 and 2016, damage from Irma would have been lower by about $430 million, a significant amount for a single storm.The co-authors hope that the estimates detailed in their PNAS paper are useful for both policymakers and the public alike.They also point out that storm protection for property is just one of the ecological services that wetlands provide. Wetlands also serve as habitat for fish and wildlife, filter industrial, residential and agricultural runoff, support outdoor recreational opportunities and sequester carbon, benefits that were not addressed in this study."}

The scientists examined the impacts of both tropical cyclones, including hurricanes, and extra-tropical cyclones, such as nor'easters.The team did so by using a new global climate computer model that allowed them to combine information on weather, climate and sea level in a fully integrated way.The scientists found that even in the absence of global warming, the Gulf Coast, and especially New Orleans, is particularly vulnerable to storm surge. As the climate warms, the Gulf Coast will be even more susceptible to extreme storm surges, said first author Jianjun Yin, an associate professor of geosciences.More than 60 million people live in the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico regions. Between 2000 and 2017, those regions were hit by 13 hurricanes that each caused more than $10 billion in damages.For both regions, storm surge heights will increase in the future as warming progresses, Yin and his colleagues found. Stronger hurricanes will affect the Gulf Coast and increased sea level will affect the East Coast.\"For the Gulf of Mexico coast, the extreme sea level is highly sensitive to tropical cyclone characteristics like the storm winds. So if the hurricane becomes stronger, there's an elevated storm surge height because the region is highly sensitive to the storm's winds,\" Yin said.\"But for the East Coast of the U.S., especially the Northeast coast of the U.S., the story is different -- the maximum storm surge is mainly influenced by the background sea level rise,\" Yin said.The paper, \"Response of Storm-related Extreme Sea Level along the US Atlantic Coast to Combined Weather and Climate Forcing,\" by Yin and his co-authors is published in the Yin had done previous research on sea level rise using computer climate models and wanted to investigate what scientists call \"extreme sea level events\" -- big spikes in daily coastal sea level, generally caused by storms.However, previous models could not handle the complex interactions between the ocean and the atmosphere Yin wanted to include, either because the models lacked an integrated approach or were too coarse.New technology, in the form of a new global climate model developed by the NOAA Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory in Princeton, New Jersey, came to the rescue.By using the new model, GFDL CM4, Yin and his colleagues could incorporate information about tropical and extra-tropical cyclones, atmospheric and oceanic circulation, weather and sea level rise. Having such rich information in the model allowed the team to more accurately predict how the seas along the eastern seaboard of the U.S. would respond to storms.The team studied the coastline from Halifax, Nova Scotia, to Houston, Texas.The researchers analyzed several simulations using the model. The control used pre-industrial conditions similar to those in the 1800s.

It provides an overview of how these very diverse ecosystems are being threatened by a combination of ongoing climate changes, increasingly extreme weather and damaging local human activities.The international team of researchers argue that only international action to decrease COLead researcher Dr Filipe FranÃ§a from the Embrapa AmazÃ´nia Oriental in Brazil and Lancaster University said: \"Tropical forests and coral reefs are very important for global biodiversity, so it is extremely worrying that they are increasingly affected by both climate disturbances and human activities.\"\"Many local threats to tropical forests and coral reefs, such as deforestation, overfishing, and pollution, reduce the diversity and functioning of these ecosystems. This in turn can make them less able to withstand or recover from extreme weather. Our research highlights the extent of the damage which is being done to ecosystems and wildlife in the tropics by these interacting threats.\"Dr Cassandra E. Benkwitt, a marine ecologist from Lancaster University, said: \"Climate change is causing more intense and frequent storms and marine heatwaves. For coral reefs, such extreme events reduce live coral cover and cause long-lasting changes to both coral and fish communities, compounding local threats from poor water quality and overfishing. Although the long-term trajectory for reefs will depend on how extreme events interact with these local stressors, even relatively pristine reefs are vulnerable to both climate change and extreme weather.\"Tropical forest species are also being threatened by the increasing frequency of extreme hurricanes.Dr Guadalupe Peralta from Canterbury University in New Zealand said: \"A range of post-hurricane ecological consequences have been recorded in tropical forests: the destruction of plants by these weather extremes affects the animals, birds and insects that rely on them for food and shelter.\"In some regions, such as the Caribbean Islands, extreme weather events have decimated wildlife, reducing numbers by more than half.\"We are starting to see another wave of global extinctions of tropical birds as forest fragmentation reduces populations to critical levels,\" explained Dr Alexander Lees, from Manchester Metropolitan University.The combination of higher temperatures with longer and more severe dry seasons has also led to the spread of unprecedented and large-scale wildfires in tropical forests.Dr Filipe FranÃ§a said that at the end of 2015, SantarÃ©m in the Brazilian state of ParÃ¡ was one of the epicentres of that year's El NiÃ±o impacts. \"The region experienced a severe drought and extensive forest fires, and I was very sad to see the serious consequences for forest wildlife.\"The drought also affected the forests ability to recover from the fires. Dung beetles play a vital role in forest recovery by spreading seeds. The study provides novel evidence that this seed spreading activity plummeted in those forests most impacted by the dry conditions during the 2015-2016 El NiÃ±o.Coral reefs were also critically damaged by the same El NiÃ±o, explains Professor Nick Graham from Lancaster University.He said: \"The 2015-16 coral bleaching event was the worst ever recorded, with many locations globally losing vast tracts of valuable corals. Worryingly, these global bleaching events are becoming more frequent due to the rise in ocean temperature from global warming.\"The last part of the study emphasizes that urgent action and novel conservation strategies are needed to ameliorate the impacts of the multiple threats to tropical forests and coral reefs.Dr Joice Ferreira from Embrapa AmazÃ´nia Oriental said: \"To achieve successful climate-mitigation strategies, we need 'action-research' approaches that engage local people and institutions and respect the local needs and diverse socio-ecological conditions in the tropics.\"The scientists caution that managing tropical ecosystems locally may not be enough if we do not tackle global climate change issues.They stress the urgent need for all nations to act together if we really want to conserve tropical forests and coral reefs for future generations."}

As Hurricane Irma made landfall, the team was able to track the movements of individual white-tailed deer in real time utilizing satellite data transmitted from the GPS collars every four hours.Using the data collected during the hurricane, the researchers were able to estimate habitat use and movement rates. \"We found that the deer, particularly the female deer, increased their movement rate substantially,\" said Abernathy, who is in her third year as a student in the Department of Fish and Wildlife Conservation. \"We also observed that the deer changed their habitat selection during the storm.\"\"Typically, deer prefer prairie and marshland habitats during the wet season -- those areas have the most prolific forage -- and avoid forests because that is the habitat of their main predator: the Florida panther,\" continued Abernathy, who has helped coordinate the project and was the lead author of the paper. \"During the storm, we observed the inverse: deer avoided those areas, selecting the pine forests at higher elevations. More than half of the animals we tracked left their home range for higher terrain.\"These findings suggest that animals have the capacity to adapt their behaviors to survive extreme weather events. Since global climate change has the potential to contribute to an increase in flooding, drought, hurricanes, and tsunamis, this research has broad implications for wildlife behavioral mitigation strategies.\"In a lot of our climate change assessments, we make the assumption that animal behavior is static and that what we observe now is how the animals are going to respond in extreme events, such as hurricanes,\" Abernathy explained. \"What this research demonstrates is that animals have behavioral mechanisms that allow for survival, but those mechanisms aren't going to be observed until the animals are undergoing a significant event.\"Abernathy's research has local implications as well: because deer seek higher elevations of pine forests during heavy storms, it is essential that land managers and conservationists protect and manage these environments. They could mean the difference between life and death for this key prey species of the endangered Florida panther.\"Heather has masterfully handled the role as the point of contact for the cooperating agencies and numerous stakeholder groups affiliated with this project,\" noted Assistant Professor Mike Cherry, Abernathy's advisor. \"Many of these groups have passionate opinions about our research, and Heather has interacted with these groups with grace and professionalism.

As a result, cities throughout the country will grapple with new populations. Effects could include more competition for jobs, increased housing prices, and more pressure on infrastructure networks.\"Sea level rise will affect every county in the US, including inland areas,\" said Dilkina, the study's corresponding author, a WiSE Gabilan Assistant Professor in computer science at USC and associate director of USC's Center for AI for Society.\"We hope this research will empower urban planners and local decision-makers to prepare to accept populations displaced by sea-level rise. Our findings indicate that everybody should care about sea-level rise, whether they live on the coast or not. This is a global impact issue.\"According to the research team, most popular relocation choices will include land-locked cities such as Atlanta, Houston, Dallas, Denver and Las Vegas. The model also predicts suburban and rural areas in the Midwest will experience disproportionately large influx of people relative to their smaller local populations.Sea-level rise is caused primarily by two factors related to global warming: added water from melting ice sheets and glaciers and the expansion of sea water as it warms. Within just a few decades, hundreds of thousands homes on the US coast will be flooded. In fact, by the end of the century, 6 feet of ocean-level rise would redraw the coastline of southern Florida, parts of North Carolina and Virginia and most of Boston and New Orleans.To predict the trajectory of sea-level rise migration, the researchers took existing projections of rising sea levels and combined this with population projections. Based on migration patterns after Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita, the team trained machine learning models -- a subset of artificial intelligence -- to predict where people would relocate.\"We talk about rising sea levels, but the effects go much further than those directly affected on the coasts,\" said Caleb Robinson, a visiting doctoral researcher from Georgia Tech advised by Dilkina and the study's first author. \"We wanted to look not only at who would be displaced, but also where they would go.\" Dilkina and Robinson worked with co-author Juan Moreno Cruz, an economist and professor at the University of Waterloo.As expected, the researchers found the greatest effects of sea-level rise migration will be felt by inland areas immediately adjacent to the coast, as well as urban areas in the southeast US. But their model also showed more incoming migrants to Houston and Dallas than previous studies, which flagged Austin as the top destination for climate migrants from the southeastern coast.This result, notes the researchers, shows that population movement under climate change will not necessarily follow previously established patterns. In other words: it is not business as usual.Sea-level rise could also reroute people relocating from unaffected areas. Counties surrounding Los Angeles, in particular, could see tens of thousands of migrants whose preferred coastal destinations are now flooded choosing alternative destinations.The results of this study could help city planners and policymakers plan to expand critical infrastructure, from roads to medical services, to ensure the influx of people has a positive impact on local economies and social well-being.\"When migration occurs naturally, it is a great engine for economic activity and growth,\" said co-author Juan Moreno Cruz, an economist and professor at the University of Waterloo.\"But when migration is forced upon people, productivity falls and human and social capital are lost as communities are broken apart. Understanding these migration decisions helps economies and policy makers prepare for what is to come and do as much as possible to make the influx of migration a positive experience that generates positive outcomes.\""}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_37", "content": "Previous research has suggested that human influences such as emission of greenhouse gasses that alter climate does affect precipitation in extreme storms. The research in this study, however, is a first to use a \"forecast attribution\" framework that enables scientists to investigate the effect of climate change on individual storm events days in advance.Changes in extreme weather are one of the most serious ways society experiences the impact of climate change. Severe weather and natural disasters account for much damage and has a major economic impact on countries. Reed and colleagues nationally are investigating ways to better forecast extreme storms in the context of climate change.In 2018, prior to the landfall of Hurricane Florence, Reed and colleagues made predictions based on simulations of the storm given climate change models. They predicted Hurricane Florence would be slightly more intense for a longer portion of the forecast period, rainfall amounts over the Carolinas would be increased by 50 percent due to climate change and warmer water temperatures, and the hurricane would be approximately 80 kilometers larger due to the effect of climate change on the large-scale environment around the storm.\"With our ability for additional 'hindsight' numerical modeling of the storm around climate change factors, we found predictions about increases in storm size and increased storm rainfall in certain areas to be accurate, even if the numbers and proportions are not exact,\" explains Reed. \"More importantly, this post-storm modeling around climate change illustrates that the impact of climate change on storms is here now and is not something only projected for our future.\"He said that while the post-storm analysis did show that the storm was slightly more intense during the forecast period due to climate change -- as they predicted -- as measured by minimum surface pressure and near-surface winds, the finding remains the most uncertain from the hindsight model.One key finding of the post-storm model showed that Hurricane Florence was about nine kilometers larger in mean maximum diameter due to climate change. Additionally, rainfall amounts over large ranges were significantly increased. Mean total overland rainfall amounts associated with the forecasted storm's core were increased by 4.9 Â± 4.6% with local maximum amounts experiencing increases of 3.8 Â± 5.7% due to climate change.Reed emphasizes that by attributing climate change effects to individual storms, as his team did with Hurricane Florence, scientists are better able to communicate the direct impacts of climate change on extreme weather to the public.The research is supported in part by the Stony Brook Foundation, National Science Foundation through the National Center for Atmospheric Research, and the Department of Energy's Office of Science."}

This rare plant requires fire to survive, and is the only host plant for two species of endangered butterfly -- Bartram's scrub-hairstreak and the Florida leafwing. Without croton, the butterflies will go extinct.\"It may seem strange to associate fire with places like the Everglades and Florida Keys, but these plants flourish in rocky, dry areas that aren't usually seasonally flooded,\" says Erica Henry, postdoctoral researcher at NC State and first author of a paper describing the work. \"Historically, pine rocklands burned frequently, and the croton seems to both seed and re-sprout following fire. But in the Keys particularly, using fire to maintain these habitats isn't possible due to human development.\"Henry was initially interested in determining the most effective means of managing croton populations in Everglades National Park and the National Key Deer Refuge on Big Pine Key. However, in 2017 Hurricane Irma struck Florida and created another opportunity for research.\"We had been looking at managed and non-managed plots in both locations -- the Everglades and the Keys -- since 2015,\" Henry says. \"Our initial focus was on the difference between mechanical understory removal and/or controlled burns versus nonmanagement, but Irma gave us the opportunity to see if any sort of human management helped recovery in the aftermath of a natural disaster.\"Prior to the storm, Henry found that croton populations with consistent fire management in Everglades National Park were stable, whereas those on Big Pine Key that hadn't been burned in 15 years were declining at a rate of 20% per year. \"This is a fast rate of decline and causes real problems for the butterflies that depend on these plants,\" Henry says.Henry resampled plants from both sites 10 months after Irma. The two locations experienced differing effects from Irma: the Keys suffered from storm surge and wind gusts up to 160 mph, while the Everglades were not overwashed and experienced wind gusts up to 100 mph. Plant survival in both locations was much higher in managed plots than in unmanaged plots, but being outside Irma's eyewall meant plants in the Everglades did better overall.\"The hurricane was especially bad on Big Pine Key,\" Henry says. \"Areas on the Key that hadn't been managed suffered the most, but the habitat management seemed to help.\"The endangered butterfly, Bartram's scrub-hairstreak -- whose numbers were declining prior to Irma -- hasn't been seen on Big Pine Key since, but are still present in the Everglades National Park. Henry hopes the research will give park and land management officials strategies to harden habitats against natural disasters.\"It seems that even in extreme conditions best practices remain best practices,\" Henry says. \"The pine rockland habitat depends on human management.

And every plot of Emanuel's graph of his power dissipation index values-versus-ocean temperature substantiated Wolf's initial suspicion that phase transitions -- such as the transition from water to vapor -- indicate just how much kinetic energy is released as the water that was turned to vapor by a hurricane then cools and falls to Earth as liquid."}

To get to the subseasonal scale, scientists need information on conditions that affects global weather such as large-scale convective anomalies like the Madden-Julian Oscillation in the tropical Indian Ocean into their computer models.\"The SubX public database makes 3-4 week forecasts available right now and provides researchers the data infrastructure to investigate how to make them even better in the future,\" said Pegion.SubX has already shown great promise forecasting weather conditions. It accurately predicted the amount of rainfall from Hurricane Michael -- roughly 50 mm, the 4th of July heat wave in Alaska where temperatures reached over 90 degrees Fahrenheit -- 20 to 30 degrees above average in some locations -- and the polar vortex that hit the midwestern U.S. and eastern Canada in late January and killed 22 people.For Kirtman and his team, the power to make these predictions requires the capacity to compute and store a large amount of data. This means they depend heavily on the UM Center for Computational Science's (CCS) computing capability to handle the complex computation needed for their models. CCS resources are critical for Kirtman and Pegion to meet the on-time, in-real-time, all-the-time deadlines required for SubX to be successful.SubX's publicly available database contains 17 years of historical reforecasts (1999-2015) and more than 18 months of real-time forecasts for use by the research community and the National Weather Service.As Kirtman and his research team pointed out in an Oct. 2019 article in the American Meteorological Society's journal"}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_41", "content": "But according to new research out of UC Santa Barbara, the rains that come once the storm has weakened may actually be more intense than when the storm is at its strongest.\"The highest intensities of rainfall occur after the hurricanes have weakened to tropical storms, not when they first make landfall as major hurricanes,\" said lead author Danielle Touma, a postdoctoral scholar at the university's Bren School of Environmental Science & Management. The study appears in the journal The finding has counterintuitive implications. \"If we're thinking about risks, we know that major hurricanes can drive storm surges, there's strong winds and so on. But this paper is also saying hurricanes are still dangerous even after they've weakened to tropical storms,\" said coauthor Samantha Stevenson, an assistant professor at Bren.Around the time Hurricane Harvey hit Houston in 2017, Touma was developing a new method for studying areas and intensities of rainfall around tropical cyclones -- which include hurricanes and tropical storms -- based on weather station data. Many previous studies have used satellite and radar data, but these records are limited to the late 20th and early 21st centuries. In contrast, records from weather stations begin in 1900. Using the measurements from the stations, Touma could calculate the extent of land that experienced rain from a given weather system, as well as how much rain fell.These issues were in sharp focus during the 2017 hurricane season, especially as flooding in Southern Texas racked up roughly $130 billion in damages, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.Analyzing decades of records, Touma discovered that the accompanying rainfall tended to be more severe after a hurricane had abated to the category of a tropical storm. In that sense, the cyclones were more dangerous after they had subsided, in spite of their slower wind speeds.\"You might think hurricanes are most dangerous when they're strongest, because that's when the winds are whipping around the fastest,\" Stevenson said, \"but this paper actually finds that the risk due to extreme rainfall is largest after the hurricane has weakened a bit.\"Tropical cyclones tend to slow down once they hit land because they are cut off from their energy source, the ocean. There's no longer warm water evaporating below them to drive the convection that fuels the system. As a result, the cyclone becomes disorganized and spins at lower speeds, causing it to spread out. \"Now it's kind of parked in one spot, and it can just dump a lot of rain on a particular location,\" Stevenson explained.Naturally, this effect is most pronounced for cyclones that started as major hurricanes. A smaller cyclone would follow the same pattern -- hit land, slow down and spread out -- but it wouldn't contain the sheer volume of water to cause the same degree of damage.Scientists predict that the intensity of tropical cyclone rainfall will increase as global temperatures rise. In fact, the team has already begun to see this trend in their historical data.\"Since our analysis used longer records than previous studies, we were better able to detect long-term trends,\" Stevenson explained. \"What this paper adds to the conversation is which types of storms we have to pay more attention to in disaster preparedness plans.\""}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_42", "content": "Linda Thunstrom, an assistant professor in the UW College of Business' Department of Economics, led the groundbreaking research to shed light on the controversial topic of the value of \"thoughts and prayers\" in response to natural and human-caused disasters.\"The results suggest that the act of praying is a substitute for material help -- in other words, prayers crowd out donations, at least in some contexts,\" Thunstrom says.In the study, Thunstrom conducted multiple, first-of-their-kind economic experiments on the topic. Three experiments focused on whether people, given the opportunity to donate to hurricane victims, would do so after they pray and think about the victims. A previous study -- conducted in conjunction with former UW sociology faculty member Shiri Noy, now with Denison University in Ohio -- placed actual economic values on thoughts and prayers through an economic experiment involving victims of Hurricane Florence in North Carolina last year.The latter study received major national and international attention after it appeared in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences earlier this year. That study found that, from the perspective of Christian hurricane victims, the monetary value of prayers by others on their behalf was significant. In contrast, atheists and agnostics were actually \"prayer-averse,\" placing a negative monetary value on prayers on their behalf by others.This new study found that people who prayed for hurricane victims before donating gave less than they would have otherwise: Because those who prayed believed that prayers improved the victims' well-being, they donated less. On the other hand, simply taking a moment to think about victims didn't have a significant effect on the level of donation. It should be noted that these results are not entirely conclusive, though: In one experiment -- in which possible donations were much smaller than in the other experiments -- prayers had no impact on subsequent donations.\"The result implies that victims of natural disasters may be financially worse off from people expressing their sympathy through the act of praying,\" Thunstrom says. \"However, this does not mean that recipients of prayers are worse off in terms of welfare. It is entirely possible that a recipient of prayers assigns a positive (monetary) value to a prayer, which may or may not exceed the value by which monetary donations drop due to the act of praying.\"The debate over the value of \"thoughts and prayers\" has come to the forefront as a result of the verbal responses of political and other leaders to mass shootings and natural disasters such as hurricanes and wildfires. Critics argue that expressing sympathy through thoughts and prayers is a meaningless gesture in response to tragedy -- and that, in some cases, it's an excuse to not take action.Thunstrom's new article notes that previous research has found that religiosity is positively associated with behavior that benefits other people, such as volunteer work in the community. She also notes that intercessory prayers increase awareness and empathy. But, because religious people believe that prayer directly impacts other people's well-being -- in other words, that prayer is a \"moral action\" similar to a charitable donation -- prayers can act as a substitute for donations.\"The results suggest that calls for thoughts and prayers in response to major catastrophes -- whether conducted individually or by entire communities -- might affect, in unexpected and important ways, people's related behavior to benefit others,\" Thunstrom says, suggesting further research that examines contexts in which complementarity between prayers and donations could exist."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_43", "content": "The traditional way of calculating hurricane damage, in order to be able to compare hurricanes and follow their development over time, was to survey the subsequent cost of the damage done by each hurricane. In other words, what would a hurricane from the 1950s cost, if it made landfall today? Using this method, a typical find is that the majority of the rising tendency in damage can be attributed to the fact that there are more of us and we are more wealthy, and there is quite simply more costly infrastructure to suffer damage. But evidence of a climatic change in destructive force by hurricanes has been obscured by statistical uncertainty.Aslak Grinsted has calculated the historical figures in a new way. Instead of comparing single hurricanes and the damage they would cause today, he and his colleagues have assessed how big an area could be viewed as an \"area of total destruction.\" Meaning how large an area would you have to completely destroy in order to account for the financial loss. Simultaneously, this makes comparison between rural areas and more densely populated areas like cities easier, as the unit of calculation is now the same: The size of the \"area of total destruction.\"In previous studies it proved difficult to isolate the \"climate signal.\" The climate signal should be understood as the effect climate change has had on hurricane size, strength and destructive force. It lay hidden behind variations due to the uneven concentration of wealth and it was statistically uncertain whether there was any tendency in the destruction. But with the new method this doubt has been eradicated. The weather has indeed become more dangerous on the south- and east coast of the USA. Furthermore, the result obtained by the research team has turned out to be more congruent with the climate models we use to predict and understand the development in extreme weather. It fits with the physics, quite simply, that global warming has the effect that there is an increase in the force released in the most extreme hurricanes."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_44", "content": "So, when Hurricane Maria struck Puerto Rico as a Category 4 storm in September 2017, Perfecto and Vandermeer had certain expectations about the types and extent of damages the storm would inflict on the coffee industry, long a backbone of the island's agricultural sector.But when they analyzed data collected at 28 Puerto Rican coffee farms less than a year after Maria and compared it to 2013 data from the same farms, many of those expectations flew right out the window.One of the biggest surprises: There was no link between the amount of shade on a coffee farm -- a key measure of management intensity -- and damage from the hurricane.The expectation by Perfecto and Vandermeer going into the Hurricane Maria study was that shade trees would act as windbreaks and that damage to coffee plants would be less severe in these \"agroforestry systems\" than at farms without trees.While most of the Puerto Rican coffee farms did lose a great deal of shade cover -- an average of 37.5% canopy loss -- there was \"no relationship\" between the amount of shade on a farm and damage to its coffee plants, the researchers report in a study scheduled for publication Oct. 30 in Instead, the researchers observed an enormous amount of variability.One possible explanation: Yes, the wind-shielding effect of shade trees is real, but it has limits. Maria was the strongest hurricane to hit Puerto Rico since 1928, with sustained winds of 155 mph.\"Canopy cover with relatively large shade trees is likely to be effective at providing some windbreak protection of coffee plants,\" said Perfecto, a professor at the U-M School for Environment and Sustainability and first author of the study. \"But when winds are so strong, those trees are toppled, and their trunks and canopies can do considerable damage to the coffee trees below.\"Across Latin America in recent decades, many coffee farmers have abandoned traditional shade-growing techniques, in which the plants are grown beneath a diverse canopy of trees. In an effort to increase production, much of the acreage has been converted to \"sun coffee,\" which involves thinning the canopy or removing it completely.That's also true at coffee farms on Puerto Rico, which are mainly clustered in the island's central western region. Those farms can be placed along a management intensification gradient that runs the gamut from highly diverse shaded systems with a forest-like canopy (least intensified) to coffee monocultures with no shade trees (most intensified).Given this wide range of management styles, Puerto Rico offered the U-M researchers an excellent model system to study the ability of coffee farms to withstand hurricane damage and to recover afterward. It's a research question that's especially important in the context of a changing climate, with the possibility of increasingly frequent intense hurricanes.The U-M-led study examined both resistance, defined as the degree to which a system can withstand damages, and resilience, the degree to which a system returns to its original state after being perturbed.While management style at a given coffee farm proved to be a poor predictor of either resistance or resilience, the socioeconomic context of individual farms seems to be a better indicator, according to the researchers.The importance of socioeconomic context can be seen by examining one key player on any farm or backyard garden: weeds.Hurricane Maria reduced shade cover on Puerto Rico's coffee farms, which stimulated the growth of weeds. Grasses, sedges and broadleaf weeds formed natural trellises that allowed vines to spread to coffee bushes, where they soon engulfed and choked the plants.Farmers who had the resources to hire laborers or to buy herbicides were able to quickly clear weeds before the vines took over.But poor or infirm farmers weren't able to mount a speedy response after the storm. Once vines climb onto coffee bushes, spraying herbicides is no longer an option, and the required labor increases dramatically.\"These processes make the resilience of coffee farms to hurricane disturbance in Puerto Rico partly a function of shade ... but also, and perhaps more importantly, a function of the socioeconomic position of the farmer,\" the authors wrote. \"In other words, the resilience of the system is a property of socioecological factors.\"In addition, some farmers who had enough money to fertilize their coffee plants seemed to have weathered the storm better than those who did not fertilize, according to the researchers. Fertilizers (either organic or conventional) can promote the growth of a well-developed root system, which can help plants withstand high winds and heavy rains.The U-M-led research team conducted a survey of 36 Puerto Rican coffee farms in 2013. The study included measurements of shade cover and other variables, as well as interviews with farmers to obtain data on expenditures for pesticides, herbicides and fertilizers.Eight of the 36 farms were abandoned after Hurricane Maria. The remaining 28 farms were resurveyed between February and July 2018. A subset of 10 farms were chosen for a detailed examination of key pests on the property. Interviews with farmers on the 10 intensively sampled farms were conducted in August 2018.The projected 2018 coffee harvest for the 10 intensively studied farms averaged 219 kilograms per hectare of green coffee beans, compared to a pre-hurricane average of 1,272 kilograms per hectare for the years 2010 through 2012."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_45", "content": "A new analysis by Princeton researchers explains why this trend is likely to continue with global warming. Both the higher moisture content of warmer air and storms' increasing wind speeds conspire to produce wetter storms, the researchers reported in a study published on October 18 in the \"Potential changes in the frequency of occurrence and rainfall rates from tropical cyclones are major concerns for flood hazards in the United States, especially for urban regions along the Gulf and Atlantic coasts,\" said co-author James Smith, Princeton's William and Edna Macaleer Professor of Engineering and Applied Science. \"This study provides an important step in understanding the rainfall rate piece of the problem; the picture is one in which changes in rainfall extremes should be carefully examined in assessing flood hazards.\"The results help resolve a puzzle that's emerged from recent climate modeling studies. Models project that by the end of the century hurricane rainfall rates will increase up to twice as fast as would be expected due to increasing moisture from rising sea surface temperatures alone. The Princeton team wanted to understand what other forces might contribute to the wetter storms.\"A predicted increase exceeding simple theory gave us a little bit of discomfort, because we only trust our predictions to the extent that we can understand them, and to the extent to which they show up in observations,\" said co-author Gabriel Vecchi, a professor of geosciences and the Princeton Environmental Institute.The researchers suspected that wind might play a role. Climate models also project that tropical storm winds will strengthen as temperatures rise, and observational studies have shown that storms with stronger winds tend to produce higher rainfall rates. Vecchi and his colleagues reasoned that a combination of higher sea surface temperatures and stronger storms might explain the predicted increases in rainfall rates.To test this hypothesis, lead study author Maofeng Liu, a postdoctoral research associate in civil and environmental engineering, devised an approach to isolate the effect of increasing wind speeds: He considered the rainfall rates of projected storms in separate groups according to their wind intensity.For each of six ocean basins where tropical cyclones form, Liu grouped storms according to their maximum sustained wind speeds: tropical storms, with winds between 39 and 73 miles per hour; and hurricanes in Saffir-Simpson categories 1 through 5, with categories 4 and 5 grouped together due to the smaller number of storms at this intensity level.Liu used this resampling method to analyze more than 4,000 simulated storms under current and future climate conditions. The approach revealed that within each storm intensity category, increases in rainfall rates with rising temperatures aligned well with the increase per degree Celsius of warming expected according to classical thermodynamics (about 7%). Only when storms of all intensities were grouped together did rainfall rates appear to outpace what would be expected to happen as a result of temperature increases alone.\"We found that not only did a storm's holding capacity for water vapor increase because of global warming,\" said Liu, \"but also that the storms were getting stronger and contributing to higher rainfall rates.\"Vecchi noted that several studies have shown the current probability of a storm like Hurricane Harvey is twice as high because of global warming. \"This study makes a statement about the future,\" he said. \"But we're having this convergence, where our observations are starting to show the increased rainfall that our models have been predicting for quite a while, and now we also have a clear theoretical understanding as to why it should be happening.\""}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_46", "content": "This increase was likely caused by disaster-related health care disruptions, said Sue Anne Bell, an assistant professor at the U-M School of Nursing and a member of the U-M Institute for Healthcare Policy and Innovation.Bell is first author on two unrelated studies that outline these findings: The most recent compares cancer patients in Louisiana who experienced Katrina to similar patients who did not experience a hurricane.The second analyzes interruptions in home health care during Hurricane Harvey, which hit Texas in 2017. While the study didn't look specifically at cancer patients, the overall findings may help explain the higher breast cancer mortality rate for Katrina survivors, Bell said.Both studies suggest a larger, more somber message.\"With an aging population there's a much higher rate of chronic disease that requires sustained treatment and access to health care,\" Bell said. \"How will we meet dialysis needs or the needs of someone with high blood pressure or diabetes or cancer?\"Even missing one week of chemotherapy has significant effects on long-term mortality. What does it mean if your access to health care is disrupted for an even longer period of time because of a disaster?\"In the cancer study, researchers compared 10-year mortality rates of Katrina survivors diagnosed with breast, lung or colon cancer within six months of the hurricane, against similar cancer patients elsewhere. They identified 1,738 cancers cases in the 12 parishes in Louisiana most affected by Katrina and 6,557 cases in unaffected counties.After adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics and cancer stage, associations among all cancer types trended toward higher mortality, but the association was statistically significant only among breast cancer cases.Bell believes that number is higher. The study was limited by the difficulty quantifying geographic inequalities that account for higher mortality among poor people diagnosed with cancer.\"One goal of my work is to find ways to drill down to the specificity of care within counties affected by a disaster,\" Bell said. \"There is a lot of variability. We need more precise ways to measure what happens to people after a disaster.\"The first step is getting a clear picture of the outcomes for older adults and people with chronic diseases after a disaster, Bell said.\"In the meantime, sharing resources like medical records, making them easier to access, and cooperative agreements between health systems that are receiving survivors would help,\" she said.In the home health study, Bell said that despite activating emergency plans, only 45% of 122 Texas home health agencies stayed open during Hurricane Harvey. Three-fourths reported that home visits were disrupted and nearly half of those lasted longer than one week. Yet, only 3% of agencies reported receiving outside help.As a clinician scientist and disaster responder, Bell sees unmet need and misery during and after disasters -- especially in the elderly or chronically ill.During Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico in 2017, Bell said she \"saw hundreds of people waiting to be seen for primary care complaints because they didn't have health care. They came multiple times and waited hours. Hospitals were full, health care offices were closed.\"Planning is important, she said. In the home care study, agencies reported moving up treatment for dressing changes or medication refills. Individuals should know medications and doses, and strategize backup plans with a PCP, she said.\"For instance, what if there's no power for electrical medical equipment? What if I must evacuate and miss medical appointments? There's a fair bit of personal accountability that the individual can do beforehand,\" Bell said."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_47", "content": "\"We're calling them 'stormquakes,'\" said lead author Wenyuan Fan, an assistant professor of Earth, Ocean and Atmospheric Science. \"This involves coupling of the atmosphere-ocean and solid earth. During a storm season, hurricanes or nor'easters transfer energy into the ocean as strong ocean waves, and the waves interact with the solid earth producing intense seismic source activity.\" The research is published in the journal Fan and his colleagues analyzed nearly a decade of seismic and oceanographic records from September 2006 to February 2019 and found a connection between strong storms and intense seismic activity near the edge of continental shelves or ocean banks.Specifically, researchers found evidence of more than 10,000 stormquakes from 2006 to 2019 offshore of New England, Florida and in the Gulf of Mexico in the United States, as well as offshore of Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and British Columbia in Canada.\"We can have seismic sources in the ocean just like earthquakes within the crust,\" Fan said. \"The exciting part is seismic sources caused by hurricanes can last from hours to days.\"Fan and his colleagues developed a novel approach to detect and locate seismic events and determine whether the seismic event is a stormquake. It must occur during a stormy day and meet other geophysical standards to determine the robustness of the correlation between the storm and the seismic event. Additionally, other seismic events such as earthquakes must be ruled out.One example the researchers cited was Hurricane Bill, an Atlantic hurricane that originated on Aug. 15, 2009, strengthened into a Category 4 hurricane and ultimately struck Newfoundland as a tropical storm. It was a Category 1 hurricane when it approached offshore New England on Aug. 22, 2009.When the hurricane arrived, numerous seismic events were located off the New England and Nova Scotia coasts, which produced transcontinental surface waves. Similarly, Hurricane Ike in 2008 caused stormquake activity in the Gulf of Mexico and Hurricane Irene in 2011 did the same near Little Bahama Bank off Florida's shore.Fan and his colleagues noted that not all hurricanes cause stormquakes. There are hotspots. Scientists detected no evidence of stormquakes off of Mexico or from New Jersey to Georgia in the United States. Even Hurricane Sandy, one of the costliest storms on record in the United States, did not spur stormquakes.This suggests that stormquakes are strongly influenced by the local oceanographic features and seafloor topography, Fan said.\"We have lots of unknowns,\" Fan said. \"We weren't even aware of the existence of the natural phenomenon. It really highlights the richness of the seismic wave field and suggests we are reaching a new level of understanding of seismic waves.\"Researchers from Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution as well as Scripps Institution of Oceanography and the U.S. Geological Survey contributed to this research."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_48", "content": "The study, which focuses on New Orleans but could serve as a model for cities around the world, is the first to show how long-term changes in soil lead levels have a corresponding impact in lead blood levels in children.\"Lead dust is invisible and it's tragic that lead-contaminated outdoor areas are unwittingly provided for children as places to play,\" says lead study author Howard Mielke, a pharmacology research professor at Tulane University School of Medicine. \"Young children are extremely vulnerable to lead poisoning because of their normal crawling, hand-to-mouth, exploratory behavior.\"Exposure to lead is often irreversible, particularly for children, and includes behavioral or learning problems, decreased IQ, hyperactivity, delayed growth, hearing problems, anemia, kidney disease and cancer. In rare cases, exposure can lead to seizures, coma, or death.In metropolitan New Orleans, children living in communities with more lead in the soil and higher blood lead levels have the lowest school performance scores. Lead was recently cited as a top risk factor for premature death in the United States, particularly from cardiovascular disease, and is responsible for 412,000 premature deaths each year.The research team began tracking the amount of lead in New Orleans soil in 2001, collecting about 5,500 samples in neighborhoods, along busy streets, close to houses and in open spaces including parks. The team from Mielke's Lead Lab collected another round of soil sampling 16 years later. Those samples showed a 44% decrease in the amount of soil lead in communities flooded during Hurricane Katrina in 2005 as well as soils in communities not affected by the levee failures and storm surge.Researchers then compared the soil lead with children's blood lead data maintained by the Louisiana Healthy Homes and Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Program from 2000-2005 and 2011-2016. Researchers found that lead in blood samples decreased by 64% from 2000-2005 to the 2011-2016 time period and that decreasing lead in topsoil played a key factor in the declining children's blood lead levels.Lead exposure is a critical environmental justice issue, according to researchers. The team found black children were three times more likely than white children to have higher blood lead levels, which could be explained by socioeconomic status and education, the type and age of housing and proximity to major roads and industry.\"While the metabolism of the city could theoretically affect all residents equally, in reality social formations produce inequitable outcomes in which vulnerable populations tend to bear greater burdens of contaminant exposure,\" Mielke says.Mielke says further study is needed to determine if demographic changes in New Orleans since 2001 contributed to the decline in children's blood lead levels, and if decreases are occurring equitably for all populations.This new study is co-authored by researchers from Australia, Colorado State University, and City University of New York."}

Just one year after the survey, the county was affected by Hurricane Florence and was nearly missed by Hurricane Dorian in September.The survey asked homeowners whether they believed in climate change, in human causation of climate change, or in God having a role in controlling the weather or climate. Coastal homeowners were also questioned about their knowledge of climate-related hazards, their knowledge of warming oceans and their perception of the seriousness of the impact of climate change.\"We found that climate change attitudes have little to no statistically significant effect on coastal homeowners' actions towards home protection, homeowner action or homeowner intentions to act in the future,\" said Tracy Kijewski-Correa, the Leo E. and Patti Ruth Linbeck Collegiate Chair and associate professor of civil and environmental engineering and earth sciences, associate professor of global affairs and co-author of the study. \"This is despite the fact that with climate change, U.S. coastlines have experienced increased frequency and intensity of tropical storms and sea level rise, which has further heightened their vulnerability to waves, storm surge and high-tide flooding.\"According to the study published in \"Despite persistent differences between Democrat and Republican ideologies in regards to climate change, the behavior of people from either party appears relatively similar. Neither has or intends to take action to improve the structural vulnerabilities of their homes,\" said Debra Javeline, associate professor of political science at Notre Dame and lead author of the study. \"Homeowners' knowledge about climate change also held no significance, showing that providing more information and understanding may not be the main driver of convincing homeowners to reduce the vulnerabilities of their coastal homes.\"The research team found that although coastal homeowners may perceive a worsening of climate change-related hazards, these attitudes are largely unrelated to a homeowner's expectations of actual home damage. Javeline says this may be a reflection of the limited communication about home vulnerabilities from other key stakeholders, like insurance companies, government agencies or sellers of home improvement products.\"Although increasing education and awareness of climate change is important, our findings suggest that encouraging homeowners to reduce the vulnerability of their coastal home may be more effective if expressed in regards to structural mitigation and its economic benefits, rather than in context of climate change,\" said Javeline."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_50", "content": "According to the researchers, climate change is linked to an increase in the frequency and intensity of natural disasters, which leads to the necessity of planning for and evaluating the risk of these disasters. Two years after Hurricane Maria, Puerto Rico is still recovering, and weeks after Dorian decimated Abaco and Grand Bahama, the recovery process of what looks like an enormous blast zone is still unclear. The impacts on New Orleans of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 are still visible in that city today.\"We have a whole distribution of damages that we usually average to determine economic impacts,\" said Francesca Chiaromonte, holder of the Dorothy Foehr Huck and J. Lloyd Huck Chair in Statistics for the Life Sciences and professor of statistics at Penn State. \"But it is the extreme events that cause the damages that are most difficult to deal with.\"With the larger, dramatic events becoming more costly, understanding the impacts and planning for future costs are important. If only averages are looked at, people can miss important changes.\"Large events can overwhelm local infrastructures,\" said Klaus Keller, professor of geosciences and director of the Center for Climate Risk Management at Penn State. \"Many decision-makers are designing strategies to manage climate risk. The success of these strategies often hinges critically on how extreme events are changing.\"Policies based only on average annual or decadal costs do not account for the increasing impact of the most dramatic events.\"Things really ramp up at the top 5% mark,\" said Chiaromonte, who is also scientific coordinator of the EMbeDS Department of Excellence at the Sant'Anna School of Advanced studies in Pisa, Italy. \"And when we get to the top 1%, damages increased approximately 20 fold between 1970 and 2010.\"The researchers chose a quantile regression to analyze the data to move away from \"average\" data findings. They also accounted for some important controls, such as changes in population and wealth over time. Even when accounting for these changes, single-event damages in the top 1% are estimated to increase by $26 million every year.\"While the effect of time on averages is hard to detect, effects on extreme damages are large, statistically significant and growing with increasing percentiles,\" the researchers report today (Oct. 7) in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.The researchers note that increases in the costs of extreme natural disasters are not uniform around the globe. They appear more dramatic in areas traditionally considered temperate.\"This may be due to the fact that extreme disasters are now hitting temperate areas as well as the fact that these areas are less prepared to deal with extreme disasters compared to tropical regions,\" said Chiaromonte. \"Tropical regions, especially those in the rich part of the world, have developed mechanisms to attenuate the impacts of extreme disasters. Similar efforts may, in fact, be needed in areas that we have traditionally considered 'safer.'\"While the economic impact of extreme natural disasters is increasing, based on the data considered in the study, mortality is on a downward trend, perhaps because of lower vulnerabilities, improved early warning systems and evacuation systems, and more effective relief efforts. However, this should not breed complacency, the researchers note. The data indicate an increase in casualties linked to extreme temperature events.An important implication of this study is that the insurance industry and public disaster management institutions should expect to face increasing economic losses, the researchers said. Another important implication is that adaptation measures will be critical in temperate areas as well as in the tropics.The researchers also note that if part of the shift to larger, more expensive, natural disasters is the result of climate change, then mitigation of climate change is an obvious approach to mitigating economic impacts.Also working on this project were Matteo Coronese, doctoral student in economics, Sant'Anna School of Advanced Studies; Francesco Lamperti, assistant professor, Institute of Economics, Sant'Anna School, and research fellow, RFF-CMCC European Institute of Economics and the Environment, Milan, Italy; and Andrea Roventini, professor, Institute of Economics, Sant'Anna School, and research fellow, OFCE Science Po, Sophia Antinopolis, France.The European Union Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation program and the Penn State Center for Climate Risk Management supported this work."}

The findings, published in \"Climate change is forcing coastal nations to reckon with a new reality of disaster management and rethink the business-as-usual development model in order to survive,\" said Jessica Silver, ecosystem services analyst at Stanford's Natural Capital Project and lead author on the study. \"In the Bahamas, the islands hardest hit by Hurricane Dorian -- Grand Bahama and Abaco -- are those our research identified as the most at risk to coastal hazards in the whole country. Understanding and mapping at-risk areas and their natural assets is a first step in changing development norms.\"The integrated approach scientists used in this study could also help other coastal communities plan where to invest in natural habitats to reduce storm damage. A combination of open-source modeling software and cutting-edge environmental analyses with local information can be used to identify where and how people in coastal communities are at greatest risk to climate disasters.Silver and other researchers at the Natural Capital Project have been working in the Bahamas for five years alongside government partners, Bahamian scientists, The Nature Conservancy and the Inter-American Development Bank. Together, they have modeled coastal hazards and the role nature plays in reducing risk in the country.\"We need solutions that leverage powerful allies to protect coastal communities now and in the future,\" Silver said. \"In the Bahamas, these allies include the hundreds of kilometers of coastal forests, mangroves, barrier and fringing reef, and seagrasses that envelop the archipelago.\"The work is part of a growing body of research showing that natural defenses can, in many places, represent more climate-resilient alternatives to traditional built shoreline protection -- like seawalls and jetties -- which is expensive to build and maintain.For example, coral reefs weaken storm surges by taking the energy out of waves. The waves that do make it past the reefs are buffered by mangrove forests and seagrass beds, which also secure sand and sediment to prevent shoreline erosion. By the time a storm reaches homes and streets, the island's environmental barricades have gradually lessened its strength. These natural defenses are also a local source of sustenance and economic security. Healthy coastal habitats support abundant fisheries -- a resource especially important in the aftermath of a storm, when food supplies are low. Thriving marine areas help communities regain their financial footing through key industries like tourism and commercial fishing.Local decision-makers often lack basic information about where and how to invest in critical risk-reducing ecosystems. So, the research team combined information on storm waves and sea-level rise with maps of coastal habitats and census data to close this information gap. The researchers assessed the risk reduction provided by coral reefs, mangroves and seagrass along the entire coast of the Bahamas using open-source software developed by the Natural Capital Project. They looked at current and projected sea-level rise scenarios to identify the most vulnerable groups of people and where they live.\"Our results show that the population most exposed to coastal hazards would more than double with future sea-level rise and more than triple if ecosystems were lost or degraded,\" said Katie Arkema, co-author and lead scientist at the Natural Capital Project. \"We see that on populated islands like Grand Bahama and Abaco, natural habitats provide protection to disproportionately large numbers of people compared to the rest of the country. Without them, the destruction from Dorian could have been even worse.\"The study equips the Bahamian government and supporting development banks with clear, actionable information to guide future investments in natural ecosystems. It shows where nature is providing the greatest benefit to people and can help decision-makers understand where and how targeted conservation and restoration projects could support coastal resilience. In the aftermath of Hurricane Dorian's destruction, the Stanford team has been in close communication with their Bahamian co-authors, who are already using these results to call for strategic investments in nature.\"We hope, in some small way, that the results of this study will help our friends and colleagues build a more resilient future for the Bahamas,\" Silver said. \"And, we hope that other countries will look to the Bahamas as a beacon of progress and fortitude in the face of climate adversity.\""}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_53", "content": "Hurricanes like Nicole can cause significant damage to human structures on land, and often permanently alter terrestrial landscapes. But these powerful storms also affect the ocean.Scientists have a good understanding of how hurricanes impact the surface layer of the ocean, the sunlit zone, where photosynthesis can occur. Hurricanes' strong winds churn colder water up from below, bringing nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus to the surface and stimulating short-lived algae blooms. However, until recently, we didn't know much about how hurricanes impact the deep ocean.A new study of Hurricane Nicole by researchers at the Marine Biological Laboratory (MBL), Woods Hole, and the Bermuda Institute of Ocean Sciences (BIOS) has provided novel insight on those impacts. Nicole had a significant effect on the ocean's carbon cycle and deep sea ecosystems, the team reports.The Oceanic Flux Program (OFP) has been continuously measuring sinking particles, known as marine snow, in the deep Sargasso Sea since 1978. It's the longest-running time series of its kind.Before hitting Bermuda, Hurricane Nicole passed right through the OFP site, about 50 miles southeast of Bermuda. This gave the scientists a unique opportunity to study how hurricanes impact the deep ocean.To study the deep ocean, the OFP strings scientific equipment, including sediment traps, at various depths on a mooring line that extends up from a 2,000-pound anchor situated on the seafloor (2.8 miles below the surface).In the new study, published in High-velocity winds associated with Hurricane Nicole generated intense surface-ocean cooling and strong currents and underwater waves, some of which lasted more than two weeks. This significantly accelerated the biological pump, with the currents pushing nutrients into the surface layer, triggering an algae bloom.The supercharged biological pump then rapidly funneled the organic material from the hurricane-induced algae bloom down into the deep ocean. This provided a big boost of food for marine life in the deep ocean where light doesn't reach.The scientists found substantial increases in fresh organic materials in sediment traps at 4,900 feet and 10,500 feet below the surface. Algae growth measurements at the OFP site after Hurricane Nicole's passage were among the highest observed in October over the last 25 years.\"The surface and the deep ocean are really well connected in the aftermath of these powerful storms,\" explained Rut Pedrosa PÃ mies, a biogeochemist and oceanographer at MBL's Ecosystems Center and first author of the study. \"The material that is reaching those depths is crucial for the deep-ocean ecosystem.\"Since 1980, seven Category 3 or greater hurricanes have passed within 186 miles of Bermuda. These hurricanes affected a total of more than 32,800 square miles of surface water, an area greater than the state of Maine.Current climate models indicate that hurricane intensity could increase as human-induced global warming continues. This could expand the area of ocean disturbed by hurricanes, with implications for the ocean's biogeochemical cycles and deep-ocean ecosystems.Due to the extreme conditions of the deep ocean, this remarkable biome has been notoriously difficult for scientists to study. Additionally, due to difficulties of shipboard data collection in extreme weather conditions, the direct impacts of hurricanes are not well understood. Sediment traps like those used by the OFP are crucial to understanding their influence on the deep ocean.When the OFP began in 1978, scientists were only able to collect a single cup of sinking particles every two months. \"Now, we have biweekly sample resolution and sediment traps at three depths,\" Pedrosa PÃ mies said.With the proliferation of new equipment and technologies to study the deep ocean, understanding this last frontier is finally within reach."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_54", "content": "\"Coastal birds are often held up as symbols of vulnerability to hurricanes and oil spills, but many populations can be quite resilient to big disturbances,\" explains lead author Dr. Christopher Field, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Maryland's National Socio-Environmental Synthesis Center (SESYNC). \"The impacts of hurricanes, in terms of populations rather than individual birds, tend to be surprisingly small compared to the other threats that are causing these species to decline.\"Field and colleagues from five other universities studied the resilience of four species of coastal birds, including the endangered Saltmarsh Sparrow. The researchers developed simulations that allowed them to explore how disturbances like hurricanes would affect the birds' populations over time. They started with models that project population sizes into the future based on the species' birth and death rates. The research team then subjected these populations to simulated hurricanes that killed a certain number of birds. Because they were using computational simulations, the researchers were able to look at the full range of potential hurricane sizes -- from storms that caused no bird deaths to storms that were more severe than anything ever observed.The researchers found that the four coastal species were able to absorb the impacts of storms across a wide range in severity. For example, the study found that a storm could cause mortality for a third of Saltmarsh Sparrows and Clapper Rails in one year, and it would still be unlikely that their populations would deviate significantly from their trajectories over time.Resilience can be defined in many ways, so Field and colleagues borrowed concepts from classical ecology and applied them to bird populations. They used these concepts to better understand the risk that these species could face from storms that are strengthening because of climate change. The research team looked not only at the ability of populations to absorb impacts, but also the birds' ability to recover over time after large disturbances. Two of the species in the study, Saltmarsh Sparrows and Clapper Rails, are declining, largely from increased coastal flooding caused by higher sea levels. The researchers found that populations were often able to recover from large storms within 20 years, even when populations continued to decline from other threats, such as regular flooding.If coastal birds are resilient to hurricanes, does that mean they will be resilient to climate change? \"It's tempting to focus on dramatic events like hurricanes, especially as they get stronger from climate change,\" Field says. \"But less visible threats like sea-level rise and increased coastal flooding are here to stay, and they are they are going to continue to drive coastal birds, like Saltmarsh Sparrows, toward extinction.\"Dr. Chris Elphick, a coauthor on the study from the University of Connecticut, suggests that there are lessons here for people too. \"After a big event like a hurricane, we often rush to rebuild and improve coastal resilience without thinking as much as we perhaps should about the longer term chronic changes in the system. Obviously, we need to respond to the damage done, but addressing the gradual, less noticeable changes, may be just as important to coastal communities in the long run.\""}

And only a quarter of those who rely on electrical power to run health-related equipment have a backup power supply.These findings and other new data from the National Poll on Healthy Aging, suggest that older adults and their loved ones and health care providers should take time to focus on key steps recommended by emergency preparedness professionals, and planning for how they will cope and communicate in an emergency.The poll, carried out by the U-M Institute for Healthcare Policy and Innovation with support from AARP and Michigan Medicine, U-M's academic medical center, asked a national sample of more than 2,200 adults aged 50 to 80 questions about their readiness for several kinds of emergency situations. Three-quarters of those polled said they had experienced at least one major emergency in their life.\"Whether it's as straightforward as a power outage that lasts a day, or as severe as a hurricane, tornado or earthquake, preparing can make a huge difference,\" says Preeti Malani, M.D., the poll's director and a professor at the U-M Medical School. \"A bit of time spent now can protect your health, and spare you worry and expense, when something like this does happen.\"Sue Anne Bell, Ph.D., FNP-BC, a U-M School of Nursing researcher and IHPI member who studies the health implications of major emergencies and disasters, worked with the poll team. \"The results of this poll can be used to target efforts to better support older adults to prepare for an emergency,\" she says. \"By knowing areas where older adults are well prepared, and where they are not, programs can work alongside older adults to become fully prepared and ready.\"Bell notes that one of the most important steps any adult can take to be ready for emergency situations is to talk with loved ones about what to do in different situations, and what needs they should consider. For older adults with health conditions, who often rely on medication, medical supplies and equipment, this can be especially important.But the poll found that only 40 percent of older adults have spoken with their loved ones about such issues.\"Having a basic emergency plan to evacuate and stay safe during a flood, hurricane or fire is a smart idea for everyone,\" says Alison Bryant, Ph.D., senior vice president of research for AARP. \"Preparing for natural disasters is particularly important for family caregivers caring for older adults who may have serious health and mobility challenges that need to be considered.\"The poll does show some areas where most older adults appear prepared. For instance, 82 percent said they have a week's supply of their medications on hand, and 72 percent said they have a week's worth of other health supplies. Experts recommend having at least this amount on hand.When it came to food and water, however, just over half of those polled said they had the recommended week's worth of these supplies on hand. Even fewer had cell phone chargers and radios that didn't require electrical power.If they had to evacuate their homes, nearly all those polled said they would have transportation. But for one in four, paying for a place to stay for a week would be a serious challenge.Financial readiness -- including saving up for an emergency fund to cover any sort of unexpected costs -- is a key part of emergency preparedness, says Bell.The National Poll on Healthy Aging results are based on responses from a nationally representative sample of 2,249 adults aged 50 to 80 who answered a wide range of questions online. Questions were written, and data interpreted and compiled, by the IHPI team. Laptops and Internet access were provided to poll respondents who did not already have them.A full report of the findings and methodology is available at"}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_56", "content": "Raging winds can demolish trees, defoliate entire canopies and scatter debris across forest floors, radically altering the habitats and reshaping the selective pressures on many organisms, suggests a new study published today in the journal \"It is tremendously important to understand the environmental impacts of these 'black swan' weather events on evolution and natural selection,\" says lead author Jonathan Pruitt, an evolutionary biologist and Canada 150 Chair in McMaster's Department of Psychology, Neuroscience & Behaviour.\"As sea levels rise, the incidence of tropical storms will only increase. Now more than ever we need to contend with what the ecological and evolutionary impacts of these storms will be for non-human animals,\" he says.Pruitt and his team examined female colonies of the spider known as Anelosimus studiosus, which lives along the Gulf and Atlantic coasts of the United States and Mexico, directly in the path of tropical cyclones that form in the Atlantic basin from May to November.To conduct the research, scientists had to tackle many logistical and methodological challenges which included anticipating the trajectory of the tropical cyclones. Once a storm's path was determined, they sampled populations before landfall, then returned to the sites within 48 hours.They sampled 240 colonies throughout the storm-prone coastal regions, and compared them to control sites, with particular interest in determining if extreme weather -- in this case areas disturbed in 2018 by subtropical storm Alberto, Hurricane Florence and Hurricane Michael -- caused particular spider traits to prevail over others.As a species, A. studiosus is divided into two sets of inherited personality traits: docile and aggressive. The aggressiveness of a colony is determined by the speed and number of attackers that respond to prey, the tendency to cannibalize males and eggs, the vulnerability to infiltration by predatory foreign spiders, among other characteristics.Aggressive colonies, for example, are better at acquiring resources when scarce but are also more prone to infighting when deprived of food for long periods of time or when colonies become overheated.\"Tropical cyclones likely impact both of these stressors by altering the numbers of flying prey and increasing sun exposure from a more open canopy layer,\" explains Pruitt. \"Aggressiveness is passed down through generations in these colonies, from parent to daughter, and is a major factor in their survival and ability to reproduce.\"The analysis suggested that after a tropical cyclone event, colonies with more aggressive foraging responses produced more egg cases and had more spiderlings survive into early winter. The trend was consistent across multiple storms that varied in size, duration and intensity, suggesting the effects are robust evolutionary responses, says Pruitt."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_57", "content": "Now a new approach developed at Penn State's Center for Advanced Data Assimilation and Predictability Techniques can forecast the intensity and trajectory of Hurricane Harvey, according to researchers at Penn State and the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration.The approach used data from the GOES-16 satellite, coupled with Penn State's all-sky radiance method, which more accurately modeled Hurricane Harvey. The data is called \"all-sky\" because it captures data in all weather conditions, including clouds and rain.The work, led by Fuqing Zhang, distinguished professor of meteorology and atmospheric science at Penn State, now deceased, is the first time GOES-16 satellite data was used to forecast hurricanes. Hurricane Harvey was the first major hurricane captured by GOES-16, which became fully operational in 2017. Zhang died in July not long after being diagnosed with cancer.When he discussed the research in June, Zhang said, \"This is still experimental. We have demonstrated that we can improve the track, position, intensity and structure of this particular event. We still need to study all other hurricane events with new satellite data but this gives us a lot of promises for the future of hurricane forecasting.\"Zhang added that this study, published in the In this proof-of-concept study, researchers used hindcasting -- using data collected during the event, but analyzing it afterwards. This allowed researchers to hone in on the most telling data and further refine the model.The process for creating operational-ready models often takes several years. It begins with hindcasted models before those models are tested alongside existing models to see if any improvements occurred. Because weather forecasting saves lives, the models undergo strict procedures and testing before implementation.The all-sky radiance approach was paired with a model developed at the National Center for Atmospheric Research with help from members of Penn State's Department of Meteorology and Atmospheric Science. When running the model for a 24-hour period, researchers found assimilating all-sky radiance data better reproduced cloud intensity and patterns when contrasted with the current model. That led to more accurate forecasting in both the eye of the storm and peripherals.Research shows common inaccuracies in forecasting hurricane intensity and structure days in advance primarily come from poor hurricane vortex generation. Better predicting the eyewall and secondary circulations of a storm could lead to more accurate hurricane prediction, Zhang said.\"We will continue to test our satellite data assimilation system with more hurricanes to see if this method works well with other severe weather events,\" said Xingchao Chen, an assistant research professor at Penn State who was involved in this research. \"In addition to all-sky infrared radiances, we are beginning to look at microwave radiances, which effectively penetrate cloudy regions.\"When researchers contrasted images created using models with and without all-sky radiance data included, it not only showed a stark improvement over operational models, it created images nearly identical to actual satellite images during the storm. The operational models that failed to predict the rapid intensification of Harvey included the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) regional-scale Hurricane Weather Research and Forecasting Model, NOAA's Global Forecast System, and the integrated forecast system by the European Center for Medium Range Weather Forecasts.\"That's the beauty of assimilating the GOES-16 satellite,\" Zhang said. \"It looks almost identical to the actual observation. The use of all-sky radiance doesn't just improve existing models. It makes a huge difference.\"Masashi Minamide, Robert G. Nystrom and Xingchao Chen, all of Penn State, and Shian-Jiann Lin and Lucas M. Harris, of NOAA, contributed to this research.

{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_58", "content": "There's a significant need for mental health interventions for social service workers, who are at high risk of burnout, chronic stress and emotional distress in disaster recovery, said the study's co-authors, University of Illinois social work professors Tara Powell and Kate M. Wegmann.\"Since many people in helping professions may be trying to rebuild their own lives while helping traumatized people in the community, providing these workers with the training and tools to practice physical, emotional and social self-care is critical to helping them reduce their own stress and avert burnout,\" said Powell, who led the study.Powell and her co-authors examined the impact that the Caregivers Journey of Hope workshop had on 722 professionals who assisted victims of Superstorm Sandy in New York and New Jersey.Sandy ravaged the Eastern Seaboard of the U.S., Canada and the Caribbean during October 2012, killing more than 200 people and causing more than $70 billion in damage. New York and New Jersey were among the hardest-hit regions on the U.S. mainland, where 87 people died and more than 650,000 homes were damaged or destroyed, according to the study.Powell co-developed the Caregivers Journey of Hope curriculum while working for Save the Children. The curriculum was designed to bolster the resilience of social workers, teachers and children in New Orleans and reduce emotional distress they experienced as a result of Hurricane Katrina in 2005.Recovery from disasters often takes years, Powell and Wegmann noted in the study. Working closely with traumatized clients and vicariously experiencing their terror and pain can adversely affect the mental health of counselors and social workers.In turn, this distress can trigger a host of emotional, behavioral, physical and interpersonal problems, negatively affecting caregivers' job performance and personal lives, according to the study.Obtaining social support can be especially important for counselors because the often-confidential nature of their work prevents them from discussing traumatizing or stressful experiences outside the workplace, the researchers wrote.\"The half-day Caregivers Journey of Hope workshop gives front-line care providers an opportunity to process disaster-related stress in a safe, confidential environment, build social support and develop strategies to cope with stressors in the workplace and at home,\" Powell said. \"A wealth of research over the past couple of decades has illustrated that higher levels of stress are associated with lower levels of social support.\"Working in small groups, workshop participants share their experiences; explore the types, sources and effects of stress; and develop solutions, such as ways they can build their social support networks. They also discuss strategies for rebuilding their communities and for enhancing individual and community-level recovery.Powell and Wegmann tested the intervention with social workers and counselors from 37 agencies in New York and New Jersey after Sandy.Participants reported substantial decreases in their stress levels and showed significant improvements on all of the other measures surveyed, the researchers found.Caregivers who were newest on the job -- those with one to four years' experience -- benefitted the most, showing the greatest gains in their ability to recognize the signs and effects of stress and in their perceived ability to cope with taxing situations.\"This finding is of particular importance, as those with less experience in the social service field are at a higher risk for experiencing various forms of caregiver distress,\" Wegmann said. \"Research has shown that those who perceive that they can actively cope with stressors or who have higher coping self-efficacy tend to have better health and mental health outcomes.\""}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_59", "content": "Researchers analyzed a continuous record kept since 1898 of tropical cyclone landfalls and rainfall associated with Coastal North Carolina storms. They found that six of the seven highest precipitation events in that record have occurred within the last 20 years, according to the study.\"North Carolina has one of the highest impact zones of tropical cyclones in the world, and we have these carefully kept records that shows us that the last 20 years of precipitation events have been off the charts,\" said Hans Paerl, Kenan Professor of Marine and Environmental Sciences at the UNC-Chapel Hill Institute of Marine Sciences.Paerl is lead author on the paper, \"Recent increase in catastrophic tropical cyclone flooding in coastal North Carolina, USA: Long-term observations suggest a regime shift,\" published July 23 in Nature Research's Three storms in the past 20 years -- hurricanes Floyd, Matthew and Florence -- resulted in abnormally large floods. The probability of these three flooding events occurring in such a short time period is 2%, according to the study.This frequency suggests that \"three extreme floods resulting from high rainfall tropical cyclone events in the past 20 years is a consequence of the increased moisture carrying capacity of tropical cyclones due to the warming climate,\" the study said.In addition to the growing number of storms and floods, an increasing global population is compounding the problem by driving up emissions of greenhouse gases, leading to increases in ocean temperature, evaporation and subsequent increases in precipitation associated with tropical cyclones.North Carolina has seen an increase in unprecedentedly high rainfall since the late 1990s. The state also has seen an increase in higher rainfall from tropical cyclones over the past 120 years, according to the study.\"The price we're paying is that we're having to cope with increasing levels of catastrophic flooding,\" Paerl said. \"Coastal watersheds are having to absorb more rain. Let's go back to Hurricane Floyd in 1999, which flooded half of the coastal plain of North Carolina. Then, we had Hurricane Matthew in 2016. Just recently we had Hurricane Florence in 2018. These events are causing a huge amount of human suffering, economic and ecological damage.\"Part of that damage comes from how frequently storms hit the coast, Paerl said. This frequency means communities and ecosystems are challenged with rebuilding and rebounding before the next storm hits. The storms themselves don't have to be intense, massive hurricanes, Paerl said. A Category 1 storm with intensive rainfall can cause huge amounts of damage.The increasing rainfall means more runoff going into estuarine and coastal waters, like the Neuse River Estuary, and downstream Pamlico Sound, the USA's second largest estuarine complex and a key Southeast fisheries nursery. More runoff means more organic matter and nutrient losses from soil erosion, farmland and animal operations, urban centers and flushing of swamps and wetlands. This scenario increases the overloading of organic matter and nutrients that ecosystems can't process quickly enough to avoid harmful algal blooms, hypoxia, fish and shellfish kills.Additionally, North Carolina's population is growing. The state has more than 10.3 million residents, according to 2018 U.S. Census data. In 1990, North Carolina had 6.6 million residents.\"We are in part responsible for what's going on in the context of fossil fuel combustion emissions that are leading to global warming,\" Paerl said. \"The ocean is a huge reservoir that is absorbing heat and seeing more evaporation. With more evaporation comes more rainfall.\"Previous research from Paerl's team has shown that heavy rainfall events and tropical storms lead to more organic materials being transferred from land to ocean. As those materials are processed and decomposed by estuarine and coastal waters, more carbon dioxide is generated and vented back up into the atmosphere, where it can add to already rising carbon dioxide levels. These effects can last for weeks to months after a storm's passage.\"We can help minimize the harmful effects of a 'new normal' of wetter storm events,\" Paerl said. \"Curbing losses of organic matter and nutrients by vegetative buffers around farmlands and developed areas prone to storm water runoff, minimizing development in floodplains and avoiding fertilizer applications during hurricane season, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions are positive steps which we can all contribute to.\""}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_60", "content": "Researchers from Georgia State and Arizona State University developed a mathematical model to study the impact of heavy rainfall events (HREs) such as hurricanes on the transmission of vector-borne infectious diseases in temperate areas of the world, including the southern coastal U.S. In the aftermath of this type of extreme weather event, the mosquito population often booms in the presence of stagnant water. At the same time, the breakdown of public and private health infrastructure can put people at increased risk of infection. The study, which was published in According to the study, an HRE that occurs on July 1 results in 70 percent fewer disease cases compared to an HRE that occurs on June 1.\"Mosquitos are very sensitive to temperature not only in terms of their ability to survive and reproduce, but also in their ability to infect individuals,\" said Gerardo Chowell, professor of mathematical epidemiology in the School of Public Health and lead author of the study. \"The warmer it is, the faster an infected mosquito will be able to transmit the virus. Considering that mosquitos have an average lifespan of less than two weeks, that temperature difference can have a dramatic effect on disease outbreaks.\"Population displacement can also affect the spread of vector-borne disease in a few ways, the researchers found. When people opt to leave the area, it reduces the number of local infections, while potentially increasing the number of infections elsewhere. However, those individuals who are not displaced during an HRE may be at higher risk because standard measures to combat mosquito breeding (such as removing pools of stagnant water) are neglected when fewer people remain in the area. And as people move into a disaster area to offer emergency relief -- or when they return after the event -- the number of local infections rises.\"Since mosquito-borne diseases tend to be spread by the movement of people rather than the movement of mosquitoes, disaster-induced movements of people can shift where and when outbreaks occur,\" said Charles Perrings, professor in the School of Life Sciences at Arizona State University and a co-author of the study.Chowell notes that as HREs become more frequent in the southern U.S. and other tropical areas there's a need to develop further quantitative tools to assess how these disasters can affect the risk of disease transmission.\"Our team will now focus on improving methods to quantify the number of people that actually leave during a hurricane, how quickly they leave and when they return,\" he says. \"We are also looking at additional hurricanes to study the impact of different displacement patterns.\"Other authors of the study include Kenji Mizumoto, assistant professor at Kyoto University and former post-doctoral researcher at Georgia State, Juan Banda, assistant professor of computer science at Georgia State and Silvestro Poccia, a visiting Ph.D. student at Arizona State.The study was supported by grant number 1414374 from the National Science Foundation (NSF) as part of the joint NSF-National Institutes of Health-U.S. Department of Agriculture Ecology and Evolution of Infectious Diseases Program.

{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_61", "content": "New work described in the Researcher Umesh Korde found steady linear improvement to infrastructure might not be the fastest way to get affected areas back online. He said mobile electricity-generating ocean platforms could be brought to such locations by sea to restore energy to those impacted areas more quickly.Using variational calculus, Korde found if mobile electricity-generating ocean devices can become a reality, it appears a quicker recovery path could be achieved through daisy chaining multiple wave energy devices with a temporary connection to shore.\"The question is, among all the different functions of time, what's the function that minimizes the total length of time that it takes to get sufficient power to restart the power grid for an island?\" he said.As a hurricane strikes, damage to an area's power grid prompts other areas in the national grid to pitch in electricity. A relatively small, isolated grid on an island like Puerto Rico might lack access to a nearby functioning grid and experience a complete shutdown.\"What you see in many cases is that they don't have access to enough spare electricity to turn themselves back on,\" Korde said. \"We might just need to provide enough to 'black-start' that grid.\"For now, however, the optimization Korde has calculated remains a tentative plan pending availability of the correct technology. A handful of wave generator projects produce electricity around the world, but these generators are not mobile enough to quickly deploy after hurricanes.Korde hopes his paper helps provide researchers looking to improve wave generator technology with a broader scope of how their technology can be used to meet the pressing needs of disaster areas."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_62", "content": "\"Our results clearly indicate the presence of coal ash at the bottom of Sutton Lake and suggest there have been multiple coal ash spills into the lake from adjacent coal ash storage facilities after, and even before, floodwaters from Hurricane Florence caused major flooding in 2018,\" said Avner Vengosh, professor of geochemistry and water quality at Duke University's Nicholas School of the Environment, who led the research.\"The levels of coal ash contaminants we detected in Sutton Lake's sediments, including metals with known environmental impacts, are similar to or higher than what was found in stream sediments contaminated by the 2008 Tennessee Valley Authority coal ash spill in Kingston, Tennessee, or the 2014 Dan River spill here in North Carolina,\" Vengosh said.Sutton Lake served as an impoundment for a Duke Energy coal-fired power plant from the 1970s until the plant was retired and replaced with a natural gas-powered plant in 2013. It is located on the Cape Fear River about 11 miles upstream from the city of Wilmington, and is now widely used for recreational boating and fishing. In September 2018, floodwaters from Hurricane Florence inundated the lake and an adjacent coal ash landfill before flowing back into the Cape Fear.Coal ash has long been known to contain high levels of toxic and carcinogenic elements that can pose ecological and human health risks if they leak into the environment. Power plants in the United States generate about 100 million tons of the ash a year. About half of it is stored in landfills or impoundments, in most cases adjacent to waterways.\"What's happened at Sutton Lake highlights the risk of large-scale unmonitored spills occurring at coal ash storage sites nationwide. This is particularly true in the Southeast where we see many major land-falling tropical storms and have a large number of coal ash impoundments located in areas vulnerable to flooding,\" Vengosh said.While several lines of evidence suggest the coal ash solids found in Sutton Lake originate from multiple spills, further analysis will be needed to determine the timeline of these events and if similar unmonitored spills have also happened in other lakes near coal ash ponds in North Carolina, Vengosh said.The spills could have been caused by floods, he noted, but other causes such as accidental release or past dumping practices cannot be ruled out.He and his colleagues published their peer-reviewed study May 24 in the journal To do the study, they conducted four independent sets of laboratory tests on bottom sediments collected in October 2018 from seven sites in Sutton Lake and three sites in the adjacent Cape Fear River. They also analyzed three sediment samples collected from Sutton Lake in 2015 and three more collected that same year from nearby Lake Waccamaw, which has never served as a coal ash impoundment.The researchers analyzed each sample using four different methods for detecting and measuring the possible presence of coal ash solids -- magnetic susceptibility, visual observation of microscopic coal ash particles, trace element distributions, and strontium isotope ratios.The tests revealed high levels of coal ash solids mixed with natural sediments in the samples collected from Sutton Lake in both 2018 and 2015.Among the contaminants detected were many metals -- including arsenic, selenium and thalium, once used as rat poison -- that have toxic impacts at elevated levels. The metals are naturally found in coal and are enriched in coal-ash residuals when the coal is burned.Past studies by Vengosh's lab have shown that some of these metals, such as arsenic, can be released from coal ash solids into water trapped between grains of sediment at the lake's bottom, where they build up and, over time, bioaccumulate up the local food web. A 2017 study by Duke University Ph.D. student Jessica Brandt revealed that 85% of all fish tissue samples collected from Sutton Lake still contained selenium at levels that exceeded Environmental Protection Agency standards four years after the coal-fired power plant there was retired. Another study showed that strontium isotope ratios in the inner ears of fish from Sutton Lake now mirror the ratios found in coal ash.\"A coal ash spill is not a one-time contamination,\" Vengosh said. \"It builds up a legacy in the environment. Even if you close the site, the legacy and threat remain, as our research has revealed at Sutton Lake and other coal ash spill sites such as Kingston, Tennessee. Collectively, these findings imply that the distribution and impact of coal ash in the environment is far larger than previously thought.\"The new study was supported by Duke's Nicholas School of the Environment. No external funding was sought.Vengosh collaborated with Ellen Cowan, professor of geological and environmental sciences at Appalachian State University, on the study. His other coauthors were Rachel Coyte, Andrew Kondash, Zhen Wang, Jessica Brandt and Gary Dwyer, all of Duke."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_63", "content": "\"The results from our field experiment unequivocally show that the loss of wetland vegetation increases the rate of erosion on wave-stressed shorelines by 100%,\" said Brian R. Silliman, Rachel Carson Professor of Marine Conservation Biology at Duke's Nicholas School of the Environment.\"These findings are going to make it hard for oil companies whose spills kill marsh grasses or mangroves on the edge of coastal wetlands to say that the loss of plants due to heavy oiling doesn't have a long-term effect,\" he said.Some industry-sponsored scientists have theorized that the increased erosion of Louisiana marshes following the 2010 Deepwater Horizon spill didn't stem from the spill itself. They say that Hurricane Katrina, which struck the coast five years earlier, was already causing the marshes to erode faster and that plant loss from the oil spill played a negligible role.\"Our study refutes that claim,\" Silliman said. \"We're not saying that soil type and hurricane-driven wave action don't affect marsh-edge erosion rates too, but our findings clearly show that the loss of plant roots compounds everything else and accelerates erosion even further.\"Silliman and his colleagues published their peer-reviewed paper May 23 in To test the competing theories, they conducted a three-year field experiment at salt marsh sites in Florida with similar soils, vegetation and wave exposure as marshes that were hit by the Deepwater Horizon spill.The researchers divided the sites into test plots of different sizes and subjected plots of each size to three different treatments. In some plots, they repeatedly cut the plants' stems down to the ground but left the roots intact. In other plots, they used herbicide to kill the plants, roots and all. Other plots were left unaltered to serve as controls where researchers could measure the base rate of erosion caused by wave action.\"In plots where we just cut off the stems, no extra erosion over the base rate occurred because the roots were still there to help hold things together. But in plots where we killed the roots too, the amount of land loss increased by 100 percent,\" Silliman said.\"The size of the test plot didn't matter. Wherever we started killing roots, that's where erosion started happening,\" he said.An analysis of other recent peer-reviewed studies on marsh erosion corroborated the team's findings and confirmed that the amount of land loss in an affected marsh is directly proportional to the amount of root loss.\"These small-scale experiments confirmed what we found in large-scale observational studies across hundreds of kilometers of heavily oiled marshes in Louisiana following the Deepwater Horizon spill,\" Silliman said. \"If a disturbance like heavy oiling kills the roots, increased erosion occurs. The more roots killed, the more erosion. And because the eroded area is much lower in elevation and is flooded continuously, the plants can't grow back. The land has been converted into sea.\"\"Coastal wetlands offer protection from storm surges and other extreme weather and climate events,\" said David Garrison, a program director in the National Science Foundation's Division of Ocean Sciences, which funded the research. \"This paper is an important step in understanding the resilience of these important ecosystems.\"Various sources have estimated that between 15,000 and 24,000 acres of Gulf Coast salt marshes experienced plant stem oiling above a 90% threshold as a result of the Deepwater Horizon spill. Previous research led by Silliman has shown that 90% is the tipping point at which root death occurs and recovery is no longer possible.\"Given the vital roles coastal salt marshes play in protecting shorelines from erosion and flooding, providing habitat for wildlife and helping clean our water, we need to better understand the thresholds of salt marsh resilience to human disturbances like oil,\" Silliman said."}

Network science typically points to the biggest interactions, or the most heavily traveled routes. That's not what we see here,\" said Jianxi Gao, an assistant professor of computer science at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, and lead author of the study. \"A little bit of flood-induced damage can cause abrupt widespread failures.\"Gao, a network scientist, worked with environmental scientists at Beijing Normal University and a physicist at Boston University to reconcile traditional network science models that predict how specific disruptions impact a road network with environmental science models that predict how topography influences flooding. Traditional network science predicts continuous levels of damage, in which case knocking out minor roads or intersections would cause only minor damage to the network. But because of how water flows over land, adding topographical information yields a more accurate prediction.In Florida, an increase from 30mm to 35mm of rainfall knocked out 50 percent of the road network. And in New York, Gao found that runoff greater than 45mm isolated the northeastern part of the state from the interior of the United States.In the Hunan province of China, an increase from 25mm to 30mm of rainfall knocked out 42 percent of the provincial road network. In the Sichuan province, an increase from 95mm to 100mm in rainfall knock out 48.7 percent of the provincial road network. And overall, and an increase from 160mm to 165mm of rainfall knocked out 17.3 percent of road network in China and abruptly isolated the western part of mainland China.The researchers validated their model by comparing predicted results with observed road outages in Houston and South East Texas caused by Hurricane Harvey. Their model predicted 90.6 percent of reported road closures and 94.1 percent of reported flooded streets.\"We cracked the data. Hurricane Harvey caused some of the most extensive road outages in U.S. history, and our model predicted that damage,\" Gao said. \"Adding 3D information causes more unusual failure patterns than we expected, but now we have developed the mathematical equations to predict those patterns.\"Gao was joined in the research by Weiping Wang and Saini Yang of Beijing Normal University, and H.

PTSD can cause nightmares, flashbacks, the feeling of being always on guard, trouble sleeping and an inability to remember parts of the traumatic event.Other key findings of the survey, in which more than 96,000 third through 12th graders took part:Orengo-Aguayo said the survey also found that more than 6,000 children reported a family member, friend or neighbor may have died as a result of the storm. \"What students reported aligns with an article in the New England Journal of Medicine on mortality rates after Hurricane Maria.\" That article, by researchers at the Harvard T.H Chan School of Public Health, estimated there were about 4,600 deaths related to the storm. The government of Puerto Rico puts the death toll at about 3,000 people.While more than 7% of the children surveyed had PTSD symptoms, that's actually lower than anticipated.

Stewart said one potential protective factor may be a concept called \"familismo\" in Spanish. \"It's the importance of family and community. Puerto Ricans place a high value on these social connections. We know from the literature that social support may be a protective factor after a traumatic event.\"The PTSD rate might also have to do with the timing of when the Puerto Rico Department of Education conducted the survey, she said. \"Most surveys have been done at the six to 12-month mark, given all it takes to get this funded and done. In this case, the department administered the surveys at five to nine months, which is sooner. Many of the students were still dealing with losses of basic necessities-food, electricity. Their focus could still be on getting these basic needs met and mental health difficulties may have developed later at the six to 12-month mark, which was not captured in this survey.\"Orengo-Aguayo, Stewart and another bilingual MUSC mental health expert, Michael de Arellano, have been part of the effort to help schoolchildren in the aftermath of Maria almost from the beginning.Soon after the storm, a friend in Puerto Rico told Orengo-Aguayo that the education secretary was looking for people who could come up with a comprehensive plan to help teachers and students deal with Maria's aftermath. Schools were closed, utilities were out and loved ones were leaving.Orengo-Aguayo and her colleagues at MUSC, along with a psychology intern from Puerto Rico, sprang into action. They realized they could use a grant they already had from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration and the National Child Traumatic Stress Network to fund the work in Puerto Rico.They've worked with the Puerto Rico Department of Education to train teachers in how to take care of their own mental health while also caring for the kids who weathered the storm.Since their first visit in October of 2017, the MUSC psychologists have been back multiple times to continue their work. They emphasize the importance of asking what people need instead of telling Puerto Ricans what to do. They've also worked closely with Joy Lynn Suarez-Kindy, a clinical psychologist who lives there, to strategize and analyze what is needed.Orengo-Aguayo said the survey shows a few things in addition to data. One, more funding is needed to pay for mental health services in Puerto Rico. Two, the island needs better ways to reach people in rural areas that don't have mental health providers around. Telehealth, which uses technology to connect patients with experts, is one possibility being explored. Three, all storm-prone areas should try to assess what mental health resources they have before a future disaster occurs, not after.She also wants to make sure people on the mainland U.S. don't forget about their fellow citizens in Puerto Rico, including children. \"Puerto Rican youth experienced significant disaster exposure and reported trauma symptoms that warrant evidence-based services. Academics partnering with community stakeholders is the way to go to change the world one child at a time. That is our lab's motto.\""}

But the same 14 chemicals were detected in more than 50 percent of the wristbands returned from the United States, Africa and South America.\"Whether you are a farmworker in Senegal or a preschooler in Oregon, you might be exposed to those same 14 chemicals that we detected in over 50 percent of the wristbands,\" said Holly Dixon, a doctoral candidate at Oregon State and the study's lead author.The study, funded by the National Institutes of Health, is published in the journal This study demonstrates that the wristbands, which absorb chemicals from the air and skin, are an excellent screening tool for population exposures to organic chemicals, said Kim Anderson, an OSU environmental chemist and leader of the research team. It's notable, she said, that most of the 14 common chemicals aren't heavily studied.\"Some of these are not on our radar, yet they represent an enormous exposure,\" she said. \"If we want to understand the impact of chemical exposures, this was very enlightening.\"Anderson and her team invented the wristband samplers several years ago. They have been used in other studies, including one that measured Houston residents' exposure in floodwaters after Hurricane Harvey.In this study, 242 volunteers from 14 communities in four countries -- the United States, Senegal, South Africa and Peru -- wore a total of 262 wristbands. The Houston residents were included in the study.Oregon State researchers analyzed the wristbands for 1,530 unique organic chemicals. The number of chemical detections ranged from four to 43 per wristband, with 191 different chemicals detected. And 1,339 chemicals weren't detected in any wristband. They detected 36 chemicals in common in the United States, South America and Africa.Because the wristbands don't measure chemical levels, the study authors didn't make any conclusions regarding health risks posed by the wearers of wristbands. But certain levels of chemical exposures are associated with adverse health outcomes.For example, exposure to certain polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) has been associated with cancer, self-regulatory capacity issues, low birth weight and respiratory distress. These chemicals were found in many of the wristbands.Exposure to specific flame retardants, which were found in wristbands in the U.S. and South America, has been associated with cancer, neurotoxicity and cardiotoxicity.And exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) has been linked to health effects such as low semen quality, adverse pregnancy outcomes and endocrine-related cancers.The researchers detected 13 potential EDCs in more than half of all the wristbands.Other notable findings in the study included:Toxicological and epidemiological studies often focus on one chemical or chemical class, yet people are exposed to complex chemical mixtures, rather than to a single chemical or an individual chemical class. The results reveal common chemical mixtures across several communities that can be prioritized for future study, Dixon said.The study authors noted two significant limitations. They relied on a convenience sample of volunteers and did not randomly recruit participants, so the chemical exposures they reported may not be representative of all chemical exposures in the 14 communities.Also, deployment length varied depending on the specific project. But they didn't detect a difference in the number of chemicals detected based on how long a participant wore a wristband."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_68", "content": "A new study analyzing Puerto Rico's hurricane history finds 2017's Maria had the highest average rainfall of the 129 storms to have struck the island in the past 60 years. A storm of Maria's magnitude is nearly five times more likely to form now than during the 1950s, an increase due largely to the effects of human-induced warming, according to the study's authors.\"What we found was that Maria's magnitude of peak precipitation is much more likely in the climate of 2017 when it happened versus the beginning of the record in 1950,\" said David Keellings, a geographer at the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa and lead author of the new study in AGU's journal Previous studies have attributed Hurricane Harvey's record rainfall to climate change, but no one had yet looked in depth at rainfall from Maria, which struck Puerto Rico less than a month after Harvey devastated Houston and the Gulf Coast. Extreme rainfall during both storms caused unprecedented flooding that placed them among the top three costliest hurricanes on record (the other being Hurricane Katrina in 2005).The new study adds to the growing body of evidence that human-caused warming is making extreme weather events like these more common, according to the authors.\"Some things that are changing over the long-term are associated with climate change -- like the atmosphere getting warmer, sea surface temperatures increasing, and more moisture being available in the atmosphere -- together they make something like Maria more likely in terms of its magnitude of precipitation,\" Keellings said.JosÃ© Javier HernÃ¡ndez Ayala, a climate researcher at Sonoma State University in California and co- author of the new study, is originally from Puerto Rico and his family was directly impacted by Hurricane Maria. After the storm, HernÃ¡ndez Ayala decided to team up with Keellings to see how unusual Maria was compared to previous storms that have struck the island.The researchers analyzed rainfall from the 129 hurricanes that have struck Puerto Rico since 1956, the earliest year with records they could rely on. They found Hurricane Maria produced the largest maximum daily rainfall of those 129 storms: a whopping 1,029 millimeters (41 inches) of rain. That places Maria among the top 10 wettest hurricanes to ever have hit United States territory.\"Maria is more extreme in its precipitation than anything else that the island has ever seen,\" Keellings said. \"I just didn't expect that it was going to be so much more than anything else that's happened in the last 60 years.\"Keellings and HernÃ¡ndez Ayala also wanted to know whether Maria's extreme rain was a result of natural climate variability or longer-term trends like human-induced warming. To do so, they analyzed the likelihood of an event like Maria happening in the 1950s versus today.They found an extreme event like Maria was 4.85 times more likely to happen in the climate of 2017 than in 1956, and that change in probability can't be explained by natural climate cycles.At the beginning of the observational record in the 1950s, a storm like Maria was likely to drop that much rain once every 300 years. But in 2017, that likelihood dropped to about once every 100 years, according to the study.\"Due to anthropogenic climate change it is now much more likely that we get these hurricanes that drop huge amounts of precipitation,\" Keellings said.The findings show human influence on hurricane precipitation has already started to become evident, according to Michael Wehner, a climate scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in Berkeley, California, who was not connected to the new study. Because so much of Maria's damage was due to flooding from the extreme amount of rain, it is safe to say that part of those damages were exacerbated by climate change, Wehner said.\"Extreme precipitation during tropical cyclones has been increased by climate change,\" he said. \"Not all storms have a large amount of inland flooding, of freshwater flooding. But of those that do, the floods are increased to some extent by climate change.\""}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_69", "content": "ASU researcher Manoochehr Shirzaei of the School of Earth and Space Exploration and former graduate student and lead author Megan Miller (now a postdoctoral researcher at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology) used satellite data to map the Houston-Galveston area impacted by Hurricane Harvey to understand why the flooding was so severe and widespread. The results of their study have been recently published in the journal For their study, Miller and Shirzaei mapped the Eastern Texas area of Houston-Galveston impacted by Hurricane Harvey using satellite radar data collected from the European Space Agency's Sentinel-1 A/B satellites and Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency's Advanced Land Observing Satellite. From this data, Miller and Shirzaei then compiled a snapshot of the extent of standing water in the area following the hurricane.They also measured land subsidence (how much the land surface moves downward) for the area before the storm using space-borne Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR), a radar technique used to generate maps of surface deformation using differences in the phase of the waves returning to the satellite. The technique can measure millimeter-scale changes in deformation over spans of days to years.\"Earth-orbiting radar satellites provide us with an opportunity to map areas when other techniques fail due to cloud coverage and lack of ground access to the area of the disaster,\" says Miller.In analyzing the satellite data, Miller and Shirzaei were surprised to see that large flooded areas fell outside the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) designated 500-year flood zones. \"This highlights the need for revising both flood hazard zone maps and flood resilience plans in coastal regions,\" warns Shirzaei.Through this analysis, they found land subsidence in the Houston-Galveston area of more than 0.19 inches (5 millimeters) per year in 85 percent of the flooded area. The likely causes of subsidence include compaction of sediments, groundwater extraction and hydrocarbon production.They concluded that the area's subsidence affected flood severity by modifying base flood elevations and topographic gradients. \"Ongoing land subsidence across the Houston area possibly lowered the flood control structures and changed floodplain boundaries and base flood drainage, which further intensified flooding,\" says Shirzaei.\"In an era of climate change, weather extremes are becoming more frequent and intense,\" adds Shirzaei. \"The combination of extreme rainfall and ground conditions are causing unprecedented flood events not only in coastal areas like Houston-Galveston, but also in Midwestern states where farmers have experienced damage to livestock and agriculture, stretching from Illinois to Louisiana.\"While risk classification maps used by FEMA provide flood hazard data, this study shows that land elevation and slope are changing rapidly and these maps may need to be updated more frequently to account for such changes.Also, land subsidence lowers coastal lands and makes them more vulnerable to flooding due to sea level rise and storm surges.\"The lessons learned from the floods following Hurricane Harvey highlight the major shortcomings of current flood resilience plans,\" says Shirzaei. \"We encourage stakeholders and regulators to use these findings to update hazard maps and improve flood resiliency plans accordingly to decide what precautionary measures are needed for their communities.\"On the horizon, Shirzaei and his research team are using the same satellite data techniques used in this study to focus on the Spring 2019 flooding that has devastated Midwestern states. They will be looking specifically at the impact of flooding on agriculture crop health and the local population. They hope to be able to provide recommendations on updating maps and resiliency plans to help these areas in the future."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_70", "content": "\"This is the first investigation reporting trauma and PTSD in our Louisiana cohort, with findings suggesting that women in this study report notably high levels of trauma as well as a high prevalence of probable PTSD,\" notes study senior author Edward Peters, DMD, SM, SM, ScD, Professor and Program Director of Epidemiology at LSU Health New Orleans School of Public Health. \"Unfortunately, less than half reported receiving past-year mental health treatment despite the high levels of PTSD symptoms, which suggests that many affected women may not be receiving needed mental health care.\"The research team, which also included researchers from Brown University, the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), and Brigham and Women's Hospital, studied 1,997 women from seven coastal Louisiana parishes affected by the spill (Orleans, St. Bernard, Jefferson, Plaquemines, Lafourche, Terrebonne and St. Mary) who were enrolled in the Women and Their Children's Health (WaTCH) Study. The researchers sought to better understand post-disaster symptomatology, particularly women's mental health. They found five distinct types of PTSD symptoms -- low, moderate without mood alterations, moderate with mood alterations, severe without risk-taking, and severe with risk-taking.Findings also include:The researchers' analysis reveals that a sizable number of women in WaTCH study communities suffer from PTSD symptoms, with roughly 13% of their sample meeting or exceeding the score threshold for probable PTSD on the PTSD Checklist, and even more women reporting subthreshold levels of PTSD symptoms.\"Our study continues to observe that women in southeast Louisiana have a high burden of mental health disorders,\" adds Dr. Peters. \"In addition to the current study, earlier publications by our team have also observed high levels of depression and mental distress in this population.\"The authors conclude that addressing mental health and access to mental health care is important in the population highly affected by the BP Oil Spill. This population also experienced other disasters, including Hurricane Katrina. With a rising number of disasters, those living in southeastern coastal Louisiana, a particularly vulnerable region of the United States, are at higher risk for PTSD and other mental health disorders.The authors report that the study was limited by use of self-reported data and one-time assessment of PTSD symptoms."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_71", "content": "Hurricane Maria not only destroyed far more trees than any previously studied storm; big, old trees thought to be especially resistant to storms suffered the worst. Lead author Maria Uriarte, a faculty member of Columbia University's Earth Institute, said that because hurricanes are projected to intensify with warming climate, the damage probably presages more such events. \"These hurricanes are going to kill more trees. They're going to break more trees. The factors that protected many trees in the past will no longer apply,\" she said. \"Forests will become shorter and smaller, because they won't have time to regrow, and they will be less diverse.\"When Maria hit Puerto Rico in October 2017, it came in as a Category 4, with winds up to 155 miles per hour and up to three feet of rain in places. Many trees were denuded of foliage, snapped in half or blown clear out of the ground. The strongest storm to hit the island since 1928, Maria killed or severely damaged an estimated 20 million to 40 million trees.Uriarte, who has been monitoring tree growth and mortality across Puerto Rico for the past 15 years, returned soon after the hurricane and began documenting its effects. For the new study, she and two colleagues homed in on a 40-acre section of the El Yunque National Forest, near the capital of San Juan, that has been intensively monitored by multiple teams since 1990. This long-term monitoring allowed Uriarte and her colleagues to compare damage from Maria with that of past hurricanes, including 1989's Hurricane Hugo and 1998's Hurricane Georges -- Category 3 storms, but the only things even close to Maria in recent times.They found that Maria killed twice as many trees outright as previous storms, and broke more than three times as many trunks. Some species suffered much worse, with breakage rates up to 12 times those of previous storms. Alarmingly, these tended to be the slowest-growing, most valuable hardwoods that in the past were the most resilient to big storms: towering mahogany-like tabonucos with great crowns, prized for furniture and boat-building, and thick ausubos, whose wood is so dense it does not float in water. These and other big trees provide habitat for many birds and other creatures that smaller trees do not. About half of the trees with broken trunks will die within two to three years, said Uriarte.However, a few species did well in all the storms, and one stood out: the common sierra palm, whose slender, flexible trunk bends with wind and quickly resprouts, grass-like, from its top if it loses foliage. Uriarte believes that the palms and a few pioneer species that can take root quickly and grow following storms may be the future of forests across the Atlantic tropics and subtropics. \"This will yield lower statured and less diverse forests dominated by a few resistant species,\" she said.Tropical cyclones derive their energy from ocean heat. Atlantic temperatures are already ascending, and models predict that by 2100, maximum sustained hurricane winds could increase by as much as 15 percent. Warmer air also carries more moisture, so rainfall could increase by up to 20 percent near storm centers. Both factors destroy trees; extreme winds do it directly, while rain saturates and destabilizes soil, encouraging uprooting. \"The expected changes in hurricane winds and rainfall may have profound consequences for the long-term resilience of tropical forests in the North Atlantic basin,\" says the study.The potential loss of many tree species could have cascading effects on forest wildlife and plants, say the researchers. This also would probably alter forests' growth dynamics, such that instead of soaking in more atmospheric carbon than they give off -- which they currently do -- the equation would reverse, and forests would become net emitters. This would be because the decay of felled trees would outweigh carbon taken in by any replacements. Along with palms, one species that probably would take over would be the fast-growing yagrumo, which shoots up quickly in sunny clearings created by big storms. But the yagrumo also is often the first to fall in storms, and so would just add to the problem. Thus, forests would help feed the very warming that is destroying them. Separate estimates suggest that trees killed or damaged by Hurricane Maria alone will release about 5.75 million tons of carbon to the atmosphere, or about 2.5 percent of the carbon taken up annually by all forests in the United States.Edmund Tanner, a senior lecturer emeritus at the University of Cambridge who studies tropical trees but was not involved in the new research, said the study is important, because \"it reports different, rather than just intensified, effects of strong versus weaker hurricanes.\" Tanner said the effects are \"probably representative of huge areas of tropical lowland forest near sea coasts, some of which are likely to experience similar or worse damage in a warming world.\" Maria \"was a Category 4 hurricane,\" noted Tanner. \"There is a Category 5.\"The study was coauthored by two researchers who have long worked in the El Yunque forest: Jill Thompson, a plant ecologist at the Centre for Ecology & Hydrology in the United Kingdom; and Jess K. Zimmerman, a professor at the University of Puerto Rico in San Juan. The research was funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation."}

The study, conducted in San Juan, also found that HIV care outcomes were related to the participants' pre-hurricane viral suppression status.Through a computer-assisted personal interview, the researchers studied a cohort of people living with HIV and a history of substance use from the San Juan Metropolitan Area using a social and behavioral assessment. They also collected blood samples to measure CD4 and viral load at the study launch and at 6-month follow-up visits, including time points before and after the Hurricane.Indicators such as homelessness, drug and alcohol use in the past 6 months, depression, physical abuse/interpersonal violence, access to care, and social support, among others, were also assessed.Viral suppression decreased from 71 percent to 65 percent across the sample as a result of the impacts of Hurricane Maria, and access to care was reduced by over 22 percent. Study participants who were not virally suppressed pre-Hurricane Maria had significantly less access to care and lower medication adherence, but made a greater number of hospital/clinic/outpatient visits post-Hurricane Maria compared to pre-Hurricane Maria.\"The impact of Hurricane Maria on people living with HIV with a history of substance use in San Juan was mixed,\" observed Diana Hernandez, PhD, first author and Assistant Professor of Sociomedical Sciences at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health. \"But from our results it is clear to see the benefits of conducting further research that will help us understand divergent paths following natural disasters for vulnerable populations.\"Co-authors include Lisa R.

{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_73", "content": "Coal ash is produced by coal-fired power plants and is often stored in ponds. If the walls of these ponds fail, they can spill coal ash into nearby surface waters -- as happened in the wake of Hurricane Florence in 2018, in Virginia's Dan River in 2014, and in Tennessee in 2008. These spills can have significant consequences, because coal ash contains contaminants such as mercury and arsenic.\"Our goal with this work was to see whether we could use bacteria to create a biocement matrix in coal ash ponds, making the coal ash stiffer and easier to contain,\" says Brina Montoya, an assistant professor of civil, construction and environmental engineering at NC State and co-author of two papers on the work.Specifically, the researchers wanted to make use of bacterial species that feed on urea and, in the presence of calcium, produce a stiff substance that binds to surrounding solids. The resulting byproduct is called biocement.\"The idea is to introduce these bacteria -- which are normally found in soil -- into coal ash ponds, along with urea and calcium,\" Montoya says. \"The resulting biocement wouldn't make the coal ash completely solid, but it would be a lot more viscous than the existing coal ash slurry.\"In laboratory experiments, the researchers found that the process works with coal ash -- the bacteria create biocement using coal ash, and the coal ash slurry becomes stiffer. In other words, the coal ash mixture is much less runny.\"This will certainly make it easier to contain, and less likely to contribute to pond failures that discharge coal ash into surface waters,\" Montoya says.But the researchers are hoping that the bacterial biocement will also have a second benefit.Because most coal ash ponds are simply unlined holes in the ground, contaminants in the coal ash can leach into groundwater, raising environmental and public-health concerns. The researchers are hoping that the biocement can also trap potentially toxic metals in the coal ash -- though that work is ongoing.\"We still have a lot to do before this technique could be implemented on a large scale, but we would welcome any industry partners who are interested in helping us fine-tune the process for use in addressing the challenges surrounding coal ash storage,\" Montoya says."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_74", "content": "The University of Vermont study is the first to look at social media patterns across different disaster types (hurricanes, floods and tornadoes), focusing on five of the decade's costliest U.S. emergencies.The study highlights two key findings: First, on average, Twitter users with small local networks (with 100-200 followers) increase their activity more than those with larger networks in these situations. Second, each type of natural disaster studied possessed its very own unique pattern of social media use.The findings, published in the journal \"In planning for natural hazards and disasters, thinking about when and what to tweet really does matter,\" says lead author Meredith Niles of UVM's Gund Institute for Environment and College of Agriculture and Life Sciences. \"We show that social media use differs markedly depending on emergency type, and these insights can help with emergency planning, where effective communications can be a matter of life and death.\"Despite the importance placed on celebrity social media influencers with millions of followers, in natural disasters average Twitter users -- those with 100 to 200 followers -- were found to be more active disseminators of useful information.\"We found 'average Twitter users' tweeted more frequently about disasters, and focused on communicating key information,\" says study co-author Benjamin Emery, a Master student in UVM's Complex Systems Center and Computational Story Lab.\"While these users have fewer followers than so-called influencers, their followers tend to have a higher proportion of friends and family, close networks that are more likely to seek and exchange useful information in emergency situations.\"Instead of relying on high-profile social media influencers to help spread important information, the study suggests efforts should be concentrated on targeting average users with meaningful networks, with compelling, accurate messages that average people will feel compelled to share in the \"social wild online.\"Researchers found key differences in tweet timing and volume, depending on disaster type. For hurricanes, people tweeted more frequently about emergency topics before the event, while for tornadoes and floods, which occur with less warning, Twitter was used for real-time or recovery information.The study suggests that the importance of Twitter for communicating potentially life-saving information could be maximized by tailoring the timing and content of messages to the emergency type.\"We show that people are much more active on Twitter just before a hurricane, when they know it's coming and they are preparing,\" says Niles, with activity dropping during the actual event. \"This suggests that Twitter is most effective as a tool to communicate preparation or evacuation information in advance of hurricanes.\"However, with more unexpected hazards, such as tornadoes and flooding, people were tweeting in real time as the situation unfolds. \"ln the case of floods and tornadoes, it appears that people are using Twitter to share critical information about resources in the immediate aftermath and recovery period,\" Niles adds.Given the importance of food and water during natural hazards, the researchers tracked 39 keywords related to emergencies, food security, water and resources and analyzed their frequency and volume increase across Twitter over the two weeks surrounding each disaster.For example, terms like \"groceries,\" \"supermarket,\" and \"prepare\" were most frequently used before hurricanes whereas terms like \"shelter,\" \"emergency,\" \"wind\" or \"food security\" were used during and after tornadoes. This suggests that people are communicating about their preparation or recovery in real-time and sharing resources that could assist those seeking help.The research was conducted under a standing agreement between the University of Vermont and Twitter that allows the university access to the Decahose (a random stream of 10 per cent of all public tweets made).Data from Twitter was collated from the five most costly time-bounded emergencies (excluding long-term droughts) in the U.S. between 2011 and 2016: Hurricane Sandy (October 2012), Hurricane Irene (August 2011), Southeast/Ohio Valley/Midwest tornadoes (April 2011), Louisiana flooding (August 2016), and Midwest/Southeast tornadoes (May 2011).Study co-authors include Gund Fellow Christopher Danforth, Peter Dodds and Andrew Reagan."}

Additionally, they discuss the conditions specific to landsliding in Puerto Rico and examine the impact of environmental variables (e.g., rainfall, soil moisture, and geology) on observed variations in island-wide landsliding.In their analysis, they show that the average rainfall from Hurricane Maria in mountainous areas was greater than that of any other hurricane or tropical storm in Puerto Rico since 1960.An important aim of the study, the authors write, is to achieve a better understanding of the factors that cause landslides in Puerto Rico in order to enhance susceptibility analyses and risk management efforts."}

Some studies have looked at stress disorders, but a new study from researchers and scholars at Tufts University examined changes in the number of cardiovascular disease (CVD) hospitalizations before and after Katrina, and the disparate effect of Katrina on black and white older adults in Louisiana.The co-first author on the study is Ninon Becquart, a former scholar in the NIH-funded Post-Baccalaureate Research Program (PREP) at Tufts who used R, SQL, and ArcMap to conduct sophisticated data analysis, including visualization. She was mentored on the research project by Elena Naumova, chair of the Division of Nutrition Data Science at the Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy at Tufts.\"Our goal with this research was to contribute to a methodology to assess the impact of natural disasters,\" said Becquart. \"We saw that rates spiked after Katrina's landfall in all older adults, especially in older black adults. The rates appear to stabilize about two months after landfall, which coincides with the clearing of floodwaters from New Orleans.\"\"We can expect to see more natural disasters because of climate change. Our study is one of the few that addresses the impact of natural disasters on CVD hospitalization rates, as well as disparities in hospitalization rates between black and white older adults,\" said Naumova. \"Considering the staggering social, economic, and health impacts of such disasters, we hope this study leads to more research and helps to inform emergency health preparedness.\"The research team focused on changes in the daily rates of cardiovascular hospitalizations (per 10,000) for adults aged 65 and older in three Louisiana parishes (counties), Orleans, Jefferson, and East Baton Rouge, over 710 days for the period from January 7, 2005 to December 17, 2006. They segmented the observation period to correspond to six time periods before, during, and after the arrival and departure of Katrina.Using data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the team assembled a database with daily hospitalization rates for all CVD hospitalizations in the three parishes over the 710 days. They added U.S. Census data supplemented by American Community Survey estimates to obtain demographic and population measures.Preliminary analysis included mapping the daily CVD rates across parishes and work with the data to identify the existing trend line for the CVD hospitalizations. They used the smoothed time series to define the six time segments and develop segmented linear regression models for the overall population in each parish and then separately for the black and the white populations.CVD hospitalization rates had been stable or declining in each parish, but -- in Orleans and Jefferson parishes -- rose precipitously immediately after landfall. This increase in CVD hospitalization rates was prolonged, lasting more than a month after landfall. Notably, the increase in CVD rates was higher among the older black population compared to the older white population, after landfall, indicating differences in the level of impact in these two populations.Over the study period, in East Baton Rouge Parish, CVD hospitalization rates were consistently higher on average for black adults, confirming what has been reported in the literature previously. No significant changes in CVD hospitalization rates were noted after landfall. The researchers speculate that this was because East Baton Rouge received more evacuees than parishes more directly hit by the hurricane, but also note that hospitals were overwhelmed and data might not be complete. In addition, they note that psychological stress has emerged as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease.The 2017-18 hurricane seasons were particularly devastating, as storms like Harvey, Irma, Maria, and Jose ravaged major metropolitan hubs in Houston, Puerto Rico, and Dominica alongside the back-to-back disasters of Florence and Michael in Carolinas and Florida.The NIH-funded PREP program at the Sackler School of Graduate Biomedical Sciences at Tufts is based on the idea that an enriched hands-on experience in research is the best preparation for additional training. It is designed to encourage students from under-represented groups to become research scientists. As a result of this project, and related coursework, Ninon has decided to focus on data analysis with the hopes of eventually completing a graduate degree in data science."}

To their surprise, they detected petrels at one site and shearwaters at two sites.\"We were doing a statewide survey for these species for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service as part of recovery action planning, but Oahu was not initially included as one of the sites to survey, since evidence suggested they weren't there,\" says Young. \"Since we're Oahu-based, we thought we would at least put a few recording units out to see if there was anything. And we were surprised, to say the least, that we not only had calls detected, but detected both species across two years.\"These could be the last survivors of remnant breeding populations on Oahu, or they could be young birds from other islands that are searching for mates and breeding sites. \"Either way, it gives us hope that we will be able to use social attraction -- that is, using calls and decoys -- to attract them nest on an island where they were once abundant,\" says Young. Oahu birds could help boost connectivity between individual island populations and provide extra insurance in case any one island's seabird population is decimated by an event such as a hurricane. As petrel and shearwater numbers continue to decline, protecting Hawaii's remaining seabirds remains a major conservation priority in the region, and the possibility that they're continuing to breed on Oahu provides new reason for optimism."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_78", "content": "When Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico last year, the worst natural disaster on record to affect the U.S. territory, it stripped numerous trees bare of their leaves and consequently disrupted their ability to absorb the light needed for growth and survival.Ecologists from Clemson University took the opportunity to study how hurricanes affect tropical dry forests in the Caribbean and whether trees were capable of compensating for the significant damage by increasing resource acquisition in newly produced leaves.For the study, the researchers examined the leaves of the 13 most dominant tree species one, eight and twelve months after Hurricane Maria struck and compared them with leaves that were collected before the hurricane. They analysed whether the immediate changes observed in leaves were temporary or maintained over multiple seasons.\"Our study took us to the GuÃ¡nica State Forest in southwest Puerto Rico, which comprises one of the best parcels of native dry forest in the Caribbean. Rainfall here is extremely erratic, with huge variability within and between years. The forest also sits on limestone from an ancient coral reef which is extremely porous, meaning trees have little time to capture water as it travels through the underlying rock. As a result, organisms are uniquely adapted to cope with unpredictable water availability,\" said Tristan Allerton, PhD candidate at Clemson University.Trees rely on exchanging gas through their leaves, simultaneously collecting COThey also looked at the newly produced leaves' shape and structure, which play an important role in efficiently extracting gas from the atmosphere.The preliminary findings suggest that 11 of 13 species studied were taking in CO\"A key finding was that the leaves of some of the species contained less chlorophyll than prior to the hurricane. Even though new leaves were better suited structurally to capture valuable resources, lower leaf quality could reduce leaf lifespan and the trees' ability to produce energy,\" added Professor Skip Van Bloem, Allerton's supervisor at Clemson University.Overall, Caribbean tropical dry forests seem to be capable of tolerating major hurricanes, though the ecologists stressed that there may be \"winners\" and \"losers\" in terms of how species respond.Currently it is unclear whether dominant evergreen species can exploit post-hurricane conditions to the same extent as deciduous species.Allerton said: \"Many of our evergreens displayed little change in gas exchange rates and in general the relative decline in new leaf chlorophyll after Maria was much greater than for deciduous species. Under normal conditions, evergreens renew their canopies over monthly/yearly timescales, therefore it's likely hurricane canopy damage is a more expensive process for these trees.\"As climate change leads to expected increases in hurricane frequency and intensity, the species composition of tropical dry forests in the Caribbean is likely to change. One concern would be whether endemic species will disappear over time.\"This would be a huge shame as Caribbean dry forests are known to have a higher proportion of endemic species than mainland dry forests. Many trees found there are also incredibly ancient, making these forests a living museum of biodiversity,\" concluded Allerton."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_79", "content": "\"Nitrate is important for plant growth but this is a case where you can have too much of a good thing,\" said William McDowell, professor of environmental science at UNH. \"The levels of nitrate we were seeing were unusually high. Over the last three decades, we've noticed elevated levels of nitrate right after a hurricane, but after these back-to-back major storms, the wheels came off the bus. We saw an increase in the nitrate levels that still has not fully recovered.\"Researchers used aquatic sensors in streams in the tropical Luquillo Mountains of Puerto Rico to obtain readings every 15 minutes to follow weekly stream chemistry after both Hurricane Irma (August 2017) and Hurricane Maria (September 2017). They compared this new data to weekly stream chemistry results compiled over the last 35 years -- the longest record of tropical stream chemistry in the world. As expected from past hurricanes, nitrate concentrations increased for a few months after each storm, peaking at around four months. The findings, reported at the 2018 fall meeting of the American Geophysical Union (AGU) in Washington, D.C., revealed that unlike past hurricanes, the increase was still evident nine months after Hurricane Maria and did not return to previous base levels. The base readings remained higher and each time it rained the nitrate levels spiked, even after small rainstorms, likely reflecting major biotic processes (leaf and tree decomposition and vegetation regrowth) that control nitrate fluxes.\"After Hurricanes Irma and Maria, there seems to be a \"new normal\" for the base level of nitrate,\" said McDowell. \"If this continues and the mountain streams transport these higher levels of nitrate to the ocean it could disrupt the coastal ecosystem, possibly endangering coral and other sea life.\"Also of concern is forest productivity. Based on previous studies and observations at the Luquillo study site, the historical frequency of major hurricane direct hits on the island was estimated to be every 50-60 years. But recent records show that it is now happening once every 10 years. With this increase in frequency and storm strength, much greater export of nitrate to nitrogen-limited coastal waters can be expected than previously estimated, which could deplete the standing stocks of nitrate in the forest and have uncertain effects on forest productivity and regrowth.This research is based on work supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and conducted at the NSF Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) and the National Critical Zone Observatory (CZO) site in the Luquillo Mountains."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_80", "content": "Two new NASA research efforts delve into Hurricane Maria's far-reaching effects on the island's forests as seen in aerial surveys and on its residents' energy and electricity access as seen in data from space. The findings, presented Monday at the American Geophysical Union meeting in Washington, illustrate the staggering scope of Hurricane Maria's damage to both the natural environment and communities.At night, Earth is lit up in bright strings of roads dotted with pearl-like cities and towns as human-made artificial light takes center stage. During Hurricane Maria, Puerto Rico's lights went out.In the days, weeks and months that followed, research physical scientist Miguel RomÃ¡n at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, and his colleagues developed neighborhood-scale maps of lighting in communities across Puerto Rico. To do this, they combined daily satellite data of Earth at night from the NASA/NOAA Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership satellite with USGS/NASA Landsat data and OpenStreetMap data. They monitored where and when the electricity grid was restored, and analyzed the demographics and physical attributes of neighborhoods longest affected by the power outages.A disproportionate share of long-duration power failures occurred in rural communities. The study found that 41 percent of Puerto Rico's rural municipalities experienced prolonged periods of outage, compared to 29 percent of urban areas. When combined, power failures across Puerto Rico's rural communities accounted for 61 percent of the estimated cost of 3.9 billion customer-interruption hours, six months after Hurricane Maria. These regions are primarily rural in the mountainous interior of the island where residents were without power for over 120 days. However, even more heavily populated areas had variable recovery rates between neighborhoods, with suburbs often lagging behind urban centers.The difference between urban and rural recovery rates is in part because of the centralized set-up of Puerto Rico's energy grid that directs all power to prioritized locations rather than based on proximity to the nearest power plant, RomÃ¡n said. Areas were prioritized, in part, based on their population densities, which is a disadvantage to rural areas. Within cities, detached houses and low-density suburban areas were also without power longer.\"It's not just the electricity being lost,\" RomÃ¡n said. \"Storm damage to roads, high-voltage power lines and bridges resulted in cascading failures across multiple sectors, making many areas inaccessible to recovery efforts. So people lost access to other basic services like running water, sanitation, and food for extended time periods.\"The absence of electricity as seen in the night lights data offers a new way to visualize storm impacts to vulnerable communities across the entirety of Puerto Rico on a daily basis. It's an indicator visible from space that critical infrastructure, beyond power, may be damaged as well, including access to fuel and other necessary supplies. The local communities with long-duration power outages also correspond to areas that reported lack of access to medical resources.The next step for RomÃ¡n when looking at future disasters is to go beyond night lights data and sync it up with updated information on local infrastructure -- roads, bridges, internet connectivity, clean water sources -- so that when the lights are out, disaster responders can cross-reference energy data with other infrastructure bottlenecks that needs to be solved first, which would help identify at-risk communities and allocate resources.Hurricane Maria's lashing rain and winds also transformed Puerto Rico's lush tropical rainforest landscape. Research scientist Doug Morton of Goddard was part of the team of NASA researchers who had surveyed Puerto Rico's forests six months before the storm. The team used Goddard's Lidar, Hyperspectral, and Thermal (G-LiHT) Airborne Imager, a system designed to study the structure and species composition of forests. Shooting 600,000 laser pulses per second, G-LiHT produces a 3D view of the forest structure in high resolution, showing individual trees in high detail from the ground to treetop. In April 2018, post-Maria, the team went back and surveyed the same tracks as in 2017.Comparing the before and after data, the team found that 40 to 60 percent of the tall trees that formed the canopy of the forest were damaged, either snapped in half, uprooted by strong winds or lost large branches.\"Maria gave the island's forests a haircut,\" said Morton. \"The island lost so many large trees that the overall height of forests was shortened by one-third. We basically saw 60 years' worth of what we would otherwise consider natural treefall disturbances happen in one day.\"The extensive damage to Puerto Rico's forests had far-reaching effects, Morton said. Fallen trees that no longer stabilize soil on slopes with their roots as well as downed branches can contribute to landslides and debris flows, increased erosion, and poor water quality in streams and rivers where sediments build up.In addition, the lidar surveys across the island corroborate findings presented at AGU by ecologist Maria Uriarte at Columbia University in New York City, who looked at tree death and damage rates in ground plots at the National Science Foundation Luquillo Long-Term Ecological Research site. Uriarte found certain tree species were more susceptible to the high wind damage, while others such as the palms, survived at higher rates, along with shrubs and shorter trees in the understory.Morton and Uriarte will continue to follow the fate of Puerto Rican forests as they recover from hurricane damages using laser technology from the ground to make detailed measurements of forest regrowth."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_81", "content": "The study, \"Anthropogenic Influences on Major Tropical Cyclone Events,\" will be published November 15 in the journal \"We're already starting to see anthropogenic factors influencing tropical cyclone rainfall,\" said Patricola, a scientist in Berkeley Lab's Earth and Environmental Sciences Area and lead author of the study. \"And our simulations strongly indicate that as time goes on we can expect to see even greater increases in rainfall.\"Patricola chose 15 tropical cyclones that have occurred over the last decade across the globe -- including the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans -- and ran high-resolution climate simulations of those storms in different scenarios, varying factors such as air and ocean temperatures, humidity, and greenhouse gas concentrations. \"It is difficult to unravel how climate change may be influencing tropical cyclones using observations alone because records before the satellite-era are incomplete and natural variability in tropical cyclones is large,\" she said.She split the study into two parts, one to analyze the effects of climate change so far, and the second to project into the future, to understand how various levels of global warming could change tropical cyclone intensity and rainfall.She found that a warming climate has already made rainfall more intense, by 5 to 10 percent, but has so far not appreciably impacted wind speeds in the hurricanes considered in this study. However if the climate continues to warm, peak wind speeds could increase by as much as 25 knots, or about 29 mph.The researchers used what Wehner, an extreme weather expert in Berkeley Lab's Computational Research Division, calls the hindcast attribution method, which he describes as the same as a forecast, except that the event has already happened \"so you potentially have more information to use.\"Wehner and Patricola used the same method last year in an analysis of a severe 2013 Colorado storm that caused record flooding. \"You can certainly use your expert judgment in a better way after the fact,\" he said. \"So you simulate the event in the world that was, followed by simulating a counterfactual storm in a world that might've been had humans not modified the climate system.\"For example, by modeling Hurricane Katrina in a pre-industrial climate and again under current conditions, and taking the difference between the results, researchers can determine what can be attributed to anthropogenic warming. However, the design of the study did not allow the researchers to examine the question of whether hurricanes will become more frequent, or whether they will move differently, such as the way Hurricane Harvey stalled for several days over Houston.Wehner also cautions that only one climate model was used (the Weather Research and Forecasting model, developed by the National Center for Atmospheric Research), and that confidence will be increased when the results are replicated in other models.In addition to the pre-industrial scenario, Patricola and Wehner also simulated the tropical cyclones occurring in three future climate scenarios, known as RCP4.5, RCP6.0, and RCP8.5, each representing increasing levels of greenhouse gas emissions and global warming. Since the beginning of the 20th century, average global surface temperatures have risen about 1 degree Celsius; in RCP8.5, the most extreme scenario, temperatures are expected to rise another 3 to 4 degrees.They found that rainfall could increase 15 to 35 percent in the future scenarios. Wind speeds increased by as much as 25 knots, although most hurricanes saw increases of 10 to 15 knots. \"The fact that almost all of the 15 tropical cyclones responded in a similar way gives confidence in the results,\" Patricola said.Another interesting finding was that the structure of storms may change where rainfall is more intense in the eye of the hurricane but less intense on the outer edges. \"In a warmer world the inner part of the storm is robbing moisture from the outer part of storm,\" Wehner said.Current state-of-the-art long-term climate simulations are approaching resolutions of 25 kilometers and finer, which can broadly represent tropical cyclones. However, important finer-scale features such as cloud clusters can only be approximated at that scale, with unknown implications for climate projections. This motivated the Berkeley Lab team to run their simulations at a resolution of 4.5 kilometers, which allowed some representation of cloud clusters. They found that the finer spatial scale did not alter the qualitative aspects of their conclusions.\"We found that the climate change influences on the wind and rainfall of Hurricane Katrina are insensitive to model resolution between 3 km and 25 km,\" Patricola said. \"This is good news because it suggests we can place more confidence in projections from global climate models at resolutions of at least 25 km, which are becoming more common.\"With 15 hurricanes simulated in five climate scenarios, each one repeated 10 times, the study used millions of computing hours on the Cori supercomputer at Berkeley Lab's National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center. \"NERSC was absolutely crucial in being able to get this research done,\" Patricola said. \"Some studies have looked at how individual storms may have changed due to climate change. One of the important things about this study is that we were able to use the same climate model and methodology for 15 storms, which allows us to assess how robust the results are, and had never been done before.\"Patricola emphasizes the importance of using both observations and climate models to understand the climate system.

{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_82", "content": "Using computer models and weather data, the researchers recreated Hurricane Harvey and compared the total rainfall with urban buildup to total rainfall without urban buildup. The results indicate that human-made development helped create a wetter hurricane -- one that dropped 40 to 60 inches of rain over four days -- as well as more serious flooding, with higher flood peaks and greater overall damage.The results highlight the human role in extreme weather events, as well as the need to consider urban and suburban development when calculating hurricane risk and preparing for hurricane damage and recovery, the authors said. The study also accentuates the need to understand the compounded human impact on rainfall and flooding caused by urbanization and climate change.\"Our focus on the role of urbanization was aimed at providing a fuller perspective of human activities on Harvey's rainfall and flooding,\" said co-author Gabriel Vecchi, a Princeton professor of geosciences and the Princeton Environmental Institute (PEI). \"Humans have influenced both climate, through greenhouse gas emissions, and the local environment around Houston through urbanization in ways that we thought could have affected rainfall and flooding from Harvey.\"The researchers found that as Houston's urban center grew upward and outward, flood risk changed, including a greater risk of higher flood peaks and more serious and dangerous flooding overall. As the city's miles of impervious sidewalks and streets increased, heavy rainfall could not be absorbed into the ground.\"Given that hurricane winds and rainfall are projected to intensify in the future, and that urbanization along our coasts is also expected to continue to increase, our work highlights the need to understand the risks and to implement appropriate flood-mitigation strategies,\" said lead author Wei Zhang, an assistant research scientist at Iowa's IIHR -- Hydroscience and Engineering research center.Much of the scientific analysis that followed the 2017 hurricane season focused on the role of climate -- including the overall warming of the planet -- in determining a hurricane's physical strength and total amount of rainfall. The Princeton and Iowa researchers decided to take a different, but complementary, tack and looked at urbanization's possible role.\"Hurricane Havey's impacts on Houston highlight hazards to coastal cities along the Gulf Coast and Eastern Seaboard of the United States,\" said co-author James Smith, a Princeton professor of civil and environmental engineering and PEI associated faculty. \"An unfortunate repeat performance from Hurricane Florence this year underscores the problems of extreme tropical cyclone rainfall in urban settings.\"The researchers experimented with different computer models to simulate Hurricane Harvey's rainfall in Houston, first looking at total rainfall with the city's current urban profile, then at rainfall for the same geographic area but with open fields and crops in place of streets and skyscrapers. They found that the non-urban areas received significantly less rainfall, and that rainfall patterns were significantly different than in the urban areas.The reason was that \"surface roughness\" due to the presence of human-made structures create a \"drag effect\" on hurricanes. This effect occurs when high winds strike tall buildings, creating friction. In the case of Hurricane Harvey, winds shifted warm surface air farther up into the atmosphere, thereby creating an optimal situation for cloud formation and precipitation.\"When Hurricane Harvey blew into Houston, it literally got snagged on the city's tall skyscrapers and towers,\" said Gabriele Villarini, associate professor of civil and environmental engineering and director of IIHR. \"The friction caused by high winds buffeting tall buildings created a drag effect that influenced air and heat movement and resulted in optimal conditions for precipitation.\"Using statistical models, the researchers also looked at year-over-year changes in flood peaks and compared them to rainfall amounts and population growth, a proxy for urbanization. They compared these results to flood peaks from the 1950s, a period that predates urban development in Houston, and again found a positive correlation between urban growth and increased flood risk.\"Urbanization is generally associated with a significant reduction in storm-water infiltration,\" Villarini said. \"Houston has experienced one of the most impressive urban-development booms in U.S. history, and with growth comes an increase in impervious surfaces. This increase in urbanization, combined with the region's flat clay terrain, represents a very problematic mix, even with flood-mitigation measures in place.\"The researchers caution that failure to account for urban factors in terms of hurricane preparation could present serious and costly problems for coastal cities.\"While this research can't be extrapolated to every coastal urban area in the nation, it does highlight the unexpected costs of development,\" Villarini said. \"For every new roadway poured and for every new high-rise erected, there is an increased risk for more adverse rainfall and flooding, and that's certainly something that city officials and residents should consider when they contemplate future growth.\""}

The murky waters of the Gulf of Mexico can make tracking the seatrout difficult, so the scientists study spawning patterns and behavior by placing underwater microphones in known spawning locations and leaving them there to record what follows.Seatrout are actually not trout but a type of drum fish, and males make a distinct pulsing noise when spawning. The sound allows researchers to map and observe changes at spawning sites -- information that state and federal agencies can use to help maintain healthy, sustainable fisheries.In reviewing recordings captured in 2017, the scientists were surprised to find that the fish were spawning every day during the spawning season. And when Hurricane Harvey hit, they were more surprised that the storm did not disrupt the spawning. The only difference was that immediately after the storm, the fish began spawning 2.5 hours early. Over the course of the five days after the storm, the spawning patterns returned to normal.The time difference was possibly due to water temperature differences brought on by the storm, Biggs noted, as the temperature returned to normal at about the same rate as the spawning patterns.\"Seatrout are an important part of the ecosystem,\" Biggs said. \"They are one of the most popular recreational fish. They are a top predator in the estuary and a favorite food for dolphins.\"The data coming out of the hurricane is a bright spot for the Marine Science Institute, which had several other projects severely disrupted by Harvey. Most of the buildings on the campus were damaged, equipment worth millions of dollars was damaged or destroyed, and many experiments were lost or set back as a result of the storm.Repairs continue on the MSI campus. The Estuarine Research Center, one of three main laboratory buildings, reopened for scientists and students in September. The campus is expected to reopen to the public in spring 2019."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_84", "content": "University of Illinois social work professors Tara M. Powell and Kate M. Wegmann led the study, which utilized a new method of assessing coping among disaster-affected youths to address the limitations of a commonly used survey called Kidcope.\"We know that the way a kid copes after a disaster determines how well they're going to overcome the experience or whether they develop problems such as post-traumatic stress disorder, depression or anxiety,\" Powell said. \"However, one of the things that we don't know is the best measure that researchers and clinicians can use to assess young people's post-disaster coping methods.\"The current study explored the coping strategies used by middle-class teen girls in St. Tammany Parish, an affluent area of New Orleans, after the area was damaged by Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Of the 650 girls in the study, about 82 percent reported that the hurricane forced their families to evacuate their homes.Six months after Katrina, the girls completed an adapted version of the Kidcope assessment, a survey widely used by clinicians and researchers to examine children's and adolescents' use of behaviors such as distraction, social withdrawal and social support to handle major stressors, including natural disasters.However, one limitation of Kidcope is that it was designed for use in clinical settings to examine young people's coping with serious illnesses and lengthy hospitalizations -- contexts that differ from natural disasters, the researchers wrote.When used in prior studies to assess coping among hurricane-affected youths, Kidcope's structural modeling was variable and unstable, according to Powell and Wegmann. To address these inconsistencies, they and co-author Stacy Overstreet of Tulane University tested three different structural models to find the best fit with their study population of young hurricane survivors.They found that the coping strategies utilized by the girls in St. Tammany Parish resembled a four-factor structural model, which included positive coping behaviors along with less healthy externalizing behaviors such as blame and anger, wishful thinking and social withdrawal.In comparing these girls' coping behaviors with those used by a sample of low-income, predominantly African-American peers who also survived Hurricane Katrina, the researchers found few similarities.Instead, the St. Tammany Parish girls' coping methods were consistent with those used by middle-class youths who were affected by a different natural disaster -- Hurricane Andrew, which struck the Bahamas, Florida and Louisiana in 1992, Wegmann said.\"We found that culture really matters in terms of how adolescents respond to a disaster,\" Wegmann said. \"Some of the cultural values that are associated with resilience, such as a focus on community and informal means of support, are less prominent among middle-class populations than lower income populations.\"Middle class and wealthier demographics' cultural values are more about individualism and personal responsibility, so the communalism that can help a person recover from a disaster just isn't there,\" Wegmann said.By utilizing a data analysis technique called \"exploratory structural equation modeling,\" the researchers found that the behavioral strategies the St. Tammany Parish girls used also had complex relationships with each other.For example, the coping strategy of attempting to forget about the problem, which was associated primarily with social withdrawal, also was associated with wishful thinking, blame and anger, and positive coping.Understanding how and why disaster victims utilize varying coping methods and the influences that demographic differences may have on their responses is hampered by the lack of consistent, reliable assessment tools, according to the authors.Developing effective, well-validated measures that can be distributed easily and adapted for differing populations should become a research priority to better assist disaster survivors with recovery, Powell and Wegmann said."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_85", "content": "A new study finds that in years where summer rainstorms in India are stronger, Atlantic hurricanes move further westward towards land. In years where the rains aren't as strong, hurricanes tend to curve northward earlier and fizzle out in the north Atlantic Ocean.This newly-discovered relationship could help scientists better predict the path of oncoming hurricanes, especially in late summer months like September, when Atlantic hurricane activity peaks, according to the study's authors.\"What amazes me is how rainfall near India can drive important changes to Atlantic hurricanes half a world away,\" said Patrick Kelly, an atmospheric researcher at the Department of Energy's Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in Richland, Washington and lead author of the new study in The Indian monsoon season has typically waned by September, but climate projections suggest that under future warming conditions, monsoon precipitation will increase, and the monsoon season could end later in the year. As the climate continues to warm, the monsoon could have an increasing influence on the paths of Atlantic hurricanes, according to the new study.\"Forecasting for landfall of hurricanes on seasonal timescales is something we just haven't typically done,\" said Benjamin Kirtman, a professor of meteorology at the University of Miami who was not involved in the new research. \"The thing that is profoundly exciting about this work is its potential to improve seasonal forecasting and predict landfalling hurricanes.\"Previous research has attributed changes in hurricane steering to El NiÃ±o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), a periodic fluctuation in sea surface temperature and air pressure in the equatorial Pacific Ocean. Scientists have traditionally relied on the La NiÃ±a cool phase of ENSO to make predictions about how strong a particular Atlantic hurricane season will be, but have trouble forecasting the paths of individual hurricanes.\"In seasonal forecasting of hurricanes, our biggest predictor of what's going to happen has typically been La NiÃ±a,\" Kirtman said. \"Unfortunately, seasonal forecasting based on La NiÃ±a hasn't been able to tell us much about landfall.\"In the new study, Kelly and his colleagues wanted to find out how the Indian monsoon, a known source of climate variability, affected hurricane tracks, since the Indian monsoon had not yet been investigated in the context of Atlantic hurricanes. They conducted simulations of hurricane tracks with a model that incorporates observed variations of monsoon intensity and found that in response to strong monsoons, hurricanes shifted significantly westward.Strong monsoons influence hurricane steering by enhancing the effects of the North Atlantic subtropical high, a center of high atmospheric pressure in the Atlantic Ocean. When the subtropical high increases, stronger winds come from the east and push hurricanes westward.According to Kelly, La NiÃ±a and the Indian monsoon are correlated, but the strength of the monsoon influences the steering of hurricanes independently of La NiÃ±a fluctuations, which are responsible for changes in hurricane frequency. In other words, La NiÃ±a fluctuations may result in more Atlantic hurricanes, but strong Indian monsoons steer them further westward, making it more likely they will make landfall in the Americas.It's important to account for the correlation when studying hurricane steering and landfall probability.\"This work untangles La NiÃ±a's role on frequency, whether there are more or less hurricanes, from the steering impacts of winds, governed by the Indian monsoon,\" Kelly said. \"La NiÃ±a events often happen during a strong monsoon, and they are correlated, but this work helps separate the independent influence of those two phenomena.\""}

The large purple area indicates very cold clouds at about -90Â°F (-68Â°C) carried high into the atmosphere by deep thunderstorms. These storm clouds are associated with heavy rainfall. The eye, which is much warmer than the surrounding clouds, appears in green. The red areas moving away from the storm indicate temperatures of around 60Â°F (15Â°C), typical of the surface of Earth at night. These red areas are mostly cloud-free.MISR carries nine cameras fixed at different angles, each of which viewed Michael over the course of approximately seven minutes when it was just off Florida's west coast on Tuesday, Oct. 9.Images from the nine views are used to calculate the height of the cloud tops, and the motion of the clouds between the views provides information on wind speed and direction. This first MISR image shows the view from the central, downward-pointing camera (left), the calculated cloud-top heights (middle) and wind velocity arrows (right) superimposed on top. The length of the arrows is proportional to wind speed, and the colors show the altitude of the cloud tops in kilometers.MISR's stereo anaglyph shows a three-dimensional view of Michael that combines two of MISR's camera angles. Using 3D red-blue glasses, you can see a number of bright \"clumps.\" These clumps, called \"vortical hot spots,\" are groups of strong thunderstorms embedded in the larger circulation of the hurricane. They indicate the rapid transport of heat energy from the ocean surface into the storm and usually occur when a hurricane intensifies quickly.The National Hurricane Center clocked Michael's sustained wind speed at 150 mph (240 kph) just before noon local time on Wednesday, Oct. 10. It is expected to bring strong winds, storm surges and heavy rainfall to much of the southeast.AIRS, in conjunction with the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU), senses emitted infrared and microwave radiation from Earth to provide a three-dimensional look at Earth's weather and climate. Working in tandem, the two instruments make simultaneous observations down to Earth's surface, even in the presence of heavy clouds. With more than 2,000 channels sensing different regions of the atmosphere, the system creates a global, three-dimensional map of atmospheric temperature and humidity, cloud amounts and heights, greenhouse gas concentrations, and many other atmospheric phenomena. Launched into Earth orbit in 2002, the AIRS and AMSU instruments fly onboard NASA's Aqua spacecraft and are managed by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a division of Caltech, in Pasadena, California.MISR was built and is managed by JPL for NASA's Science Mission Directorate in Washington.

{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_87", "content": "Political bias and partisan news reporting influence whether people report experiencing certain extreme weather events, the research suggests.But Americans who lived in areas where a variety of extreme events were recorded -- flood, tornado, hurricane, and drought -- were ultimately no more likely to share the same beliefs about climate change as scientists.Dr Ben Lyons, from the University of Exeter, who led the research, said: \"\"Extreme weather plays a limited long-term role in forming people's beliefs about climate change. Instead, their views and beliefs can alter the way they perceive the weather. We have found when an extreme weather event is ambiguous, as with polar vortex and drought, people are more likely to see the event through a partisan lens. If there is grey area, people are more comfortable applying their preferred label.\"The University of Exeter, University of Michigan and University of Texas research found that Republicans were less likely to report experiencing a polar vortex, while those exposed to liberal media were more likely.However the weather can be sometimes so extreme that it overshadows personal views -- the researchers found that partisanship and media use did not affect the way people in the American Northeast -- where the 2014 and 2015 polar vortex events hit hardest -- reported the weather they had experienced.Those who favoured liberal news sources such as the Huffington Post or the Daily Show reported experiencing drought more often than national weather data would suggest they actually did.Dr Lyons said: \"Very extreme weather accompanied by constant media coverage is harder for people to deny. But on the other end of the scale, droughts can take longer to have an effect, so people have some difficulty perceiving their onset and this may allow them to bring their biases to the table.\"Academics surveyed 3,057 people in the USA to ask them about the extreme weather they had experienced over a five-year period, and also if they believed in climate change, human causation, and the scientific consensus on the matter. They also asked where they lived. The experts were then able to compare these answers to official weather reports for that region for the same time period.Data about the weather was taken from the Storm Events Database compiled by NOAA's National Weather Service (NWS). The data included droughts, floods, tornadoes, and hurricanes. A total of 21.7 per cent of respondents reported experiencing a polar vortex, 41.0 percent a drought, 19.8 percent a tornado, 29.3 percent flood, and 16.7 per cent a hurricane in the past five years. However the data shows 21.3 per cent lived in a county where a flood was recorded over the time period, 25.3 per cent a tornado, 4.3 per cent a hurricane, and 4.4 per cent drought.A total of 59.2 per cent of respondents agreed that \"there is solid evidence that the average temperature on earth has been getting warmer over the past few decades.\" Of respondents who agreed with this statement, 74.2 per cent agreed that the Earth was warming mostly due to \"human activity such as burning fossil fuels.\"Dr Lyons said: \"This research shows people's perception of extreme weather can be processed through partisan lenses. This means efforts to connect extreme events with climate change may do more to rally those with liberal beliefs than convince those with more conservative views that humans are having an impact on the climate. \"However, it's important to note that we take a big-picture look rather than focus on specific events. Particularly intense events -- a 100-year flood or catastrophic hurricane -- might be most capable of influencing attitudes.\""}

The experiments were hindcast, meaning the models were run after the weather event and compared with actual events. The model was able to forecast supercell thunderstorms with atmospheric conditions that are very conducive to tornadoes.The results, reported in \"It's not just the data that's important,\" Fuqing Zhang, professor of meteorology and director of ADAPT said. \"It's how we design very sophisticated numerical mathematical algorithms to ingest that satellite data into the model. This is really our expertise and our pride. Our team is the first to be able to effectively take in this high resolution satellite data and prove it can be useful in real-case scenarios.\"Forecasting tornadic thunderstorms is important because these events are especially quick to form, hard to predict and can cause catastrophic damage. Thunderstorms account for 40 percent of all severe weather events in the United States, causing 14 percent of damage and 17 percent of related deaths, according to the National Climate Data Center.\"For many storms in the United States, we have good radar data, however, it's very hard using any of the existing technologies to capture the environmental and storm conditions before the storm totally develops,\" Zhang said. \"We're able to extend the warning time for these events because the satellite can look at the field even before the clouds form and our models can ingest that information to improve and advance forecasts.\"In the past 40 years, tornado warning lead-time -- meaning the time interval between when a warning is issued and the tornado occurs -- has increased on average from 3 to 14 minutes. Zhang said this method could extend that lead time even further.\"Researchers have made huge improvements in tornado lead times but, for many people, 14 minutes isn't enough,\" said David Stensrud, head of the Department of Meteorology and Atmospheric Science at Penn State. \"If you have a big sports stadium or a hospital it takes more than 14 minutes to prepare for the weather threat. There is certainly a need for more advanced warnings. Our research indicates that by combining data assimilation and high-resolution models we can get lead times beyond 30 minutes. Doubling the lead time would have huge potential societal impacts.\"Better models and better data supplied by GOES-16 could also reduce false alarm rates, he said.Researchers are working with NOAA and the National Weather Service to ready the algorithms for ingesting these satellite data for widespread use.Satellite data has proven tricky for use in weather models because satellites do not capture key variables such as wind speed, pressure, temperature and water vapor. But satellites capture data known as brightness temperature, which show how much radiation is emitted by objects on Earth and in the atmosphere at different infrared frequencies. Using all-sky radiance, researchers can use brightness temperature captured at different frequencies to paint a picture of cloud formations and water vapor fields.In research that's still under review and profiled in Nature, Zhang and his colleagues show this method forecasted that Hurricane Harvey would reach a category 4 while existing models forecast it as a category 1. Harvey became the first category 4 hurricane to make landfall along the Texas coast since 1961.GOES-16 covers one-sixth of the Earth, including the Eastern portion of the United States and all of the Atlantic Ocean, and is geostationary. It replaces GOES-13, offering data resolution at a scale slightly larger than half a mile, much better than its predecessor at 2.5 miles, and with data available every 5 minutes or less.The increased spatial and temporal resolution is important because it offers much more information about what is taking place within thunderstorms, hurricanes and other severe weather events. The satellite uses 16 bands of image data using visible and infrared light to reveal factors such as fog, winds, vegetation, snow and ice, fires, water vapor and lightning. It is one of three similar satellites in operation that collectively cover nearly all habitable land and surrounding oceans.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration operates GOES with contributions from NASA.

Climate change is eroding at all levels the most complex systems, such as reefs created by scleractinian corals, which are efficient animals that capture light through their symbionts (microscopic algae) to nourish themselves and build \"stone.\" That same \"stone\" (the hard part of the coral, formed by calcium carbonate) is partly responsible for the high rate of algae photosynthesis, which supply up to 95% of the nutrients the animal needs to live.\"What is going on? Although the light may remain fairly constant, the sea temperature has risen,\" explains Rossi. The higher the temperatures, the more acceleration of the metabolic processes related to the photosynthetic process, to the extent that toxic molecules are created. The excess toxicity caused by the algae bothers the coral ... or the algae itself, it is not clear. What is clear is that when the temperature is too high, the algae simply leave the coral. This process is known as bleaching. And without algae, with only 5-15% of nutrients, the coral dies.Given this situation, the gorgonians (and sponges) are replacing the dead coral to a great extent. The study, which was recently published in the journal However, according to the researcher, the replacement of corals by gorgonians is not entirely satisfactory. Although the gorgonians are more flexible to changes and adapt better, they store and retain less amount of carbon from the atmosphere, and their structures do not form reefs such as hard corals, nor are they more resistant to hurricanes. According to Rossi, \"99% of the energy of the waves reaching the coastline during a hurricane is absorbed by coral reefs.\" Therefore, the study concludes that the disappearance of these reefs and other complex and long-lived biogenic structures only accelerates the degradation process of the entire planet."}

That means that the cloud tops are lower in the atmosphere, and the storms are not as powerful. That's because vertical wind shear, the change of speed and direction of winds with altitude was buffeting the southern side of Florence and preventing the development of higher, stronger thunderstorms in that part of the storm.NOAA's National Hurricane Center (NHC) said \"microwave overpass indicated that the convection over the southern and southeastern portions of the storm is still disrupted, and that the eyewall was open to the southeast. It appears that some southern shear has caused the degradation of the inner core. The global models suggest that this shear will relax today while Florence moves over warm waters, however, given the current storm structure, little overall change in strength is anticipated as Florence approaches the coast.\"At 2:20 a.m. EDT (0230 UTC) on Sept. 13, Moderate Resolution Imagine Spectroradiometer or MODIS instrument aboard NASA's Aqua satellite analyzed Hurricane Florence in infrared light.

{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_91", "content": "Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico in September 2017 and, soon after, the government of Puerto Rico determined that 64 people had died. Later, unofficial investigations and independent scientific studies suggested that the death toll was likely much higher. To get a more accurate and rigorous assessment, the Governor of Puerto Rico commissioned an independent study from GW Milken Institute SPH.Today, GW Milken Institute SPH, in collaboration with researchers from the University of Puerto Rico Graduate School of Public Health, delivered on that request.\"The results of our epidemiological study suggest that, tragically, Hurricane Maria led to a large number of excess deaths throughout the island. Certain groups -- those in lower income areas and the elderly -- faced the highest risk,\" said Carlos Santos-Burgoa, MD, MPH, PhD, the principal investigator of the project and a professor of global health at GW Milken Institute SPH. \"We hope this report and its recommendations will help build the island's resilience and pave the way toward a plan that will protect all sectors of society in times of natural disasters.\"The epidemiological study found:The research represents the most rigorous study of excess mortality due to the hurricane done to date. The GW-led team analyzed death certificates and other mortality data for six months from September 2017 through February 2018. Using a sophisticated mathematical model, the team compared the total number of deaths during that time to the expected number based on historical patterns. The researchers also adjusted for age, sex and migration from the island.In addition to estimating the excess deaths, the team also sought to identify flaws in mortality surveillance and communications systems and to offer recommendations aimed at helping Puerto Rico -- and the mainland U.S. -- establish better methods for disaster preparedness and response.The team found that lack of communication, well established guidelines and lack of training for physicians on how to certify deaths in disasters, resulted in a limited number of deaths being identified as hurricane related. Thus, like other jurisdictions that are part of the U.S., the death certification process can lead to an undercount of deaths related to disasters like Hurricane Maria. The team found error rates in death certificates that were within the norms. In fact, similar error rates in death certificates are found throughout the United States. To reduce such errors, the team recommends that physicians and other relevant health care providers in Puerto Rico -- and on the mainland -- receive explicit training so that they can more accurately certify deaths under disaster conditions.The team also found that poor communication about deaths after the disaster, and especially the distinction between deaths directly related to the storm and those indirectly tied to it, contributed to confusion and consternation among members of the public.The report provides a number of key recommendations:\"The lessons learned from this report and subsequent studies will help not just Puerto Rico, but other regions in the U.S. and around the world that face the ongoing threat of hurricanes and other natural disasters,\" said Lynn R. Goldman, MD, MS, MPH, Michael and Lori Milken Dean of the GW Milken Institute SPH and a co-author of the report. \"If enacted, the recommendations of this report could help save lives in Puerto Rico and beyond.\"The report is entitled, \"Ascertainment of the Estimated Excess Mortality from Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico.\""}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_92", "content": "The finding is particularly significant because the species had been feared extinct following the catastrophic damage caused by Hurricane Matthew in 2016, and had not been found in subsequent searches.But it is feared that there could only be two left -- placing the species on the verge of extinction and certainly among the world's most critically endangered birds.The Bahama Nuthatch is an endangered species, only known from a small area of native pine forest on Grand Bahama Island, which lies approximately 100 miles off Palm Beach, Florida.University of East Anglia masters students Matthew Gardner and David Pereira set out on a three-month expedition to find this and other endemic Caribbean pine forest bird species.They made their way through dense forest with thick 'poisonwood' understorey -- the layer of vegetation growing beneath the main forest canopy -- in what is thought to be one of the most exhaustive searches of the island.They worked in partnership with Nigel Collar and David Wege from Birdlife International and the Bahamas National Trust, the organisation which works to protect the habitats and species of The Bahama Islands.Meanwhile a second team of Bahamian students, led by Zeko McKenzie of the University of The Bahamas-North and supported by the American Bird Conservancy, also searched for the bird.The Bahama Nuthatch has a long bill, a distinctive high-pitched squeaky call, and nests only in mature pine trees. There had been a sharp decline in its population crashing from an estimated 1,800 in 2004 to just 23 being seen in a survey in 2007. The decline likely began in the 1950s due to habitat loss due to timber removal, and more recently due to hurricane damage, storm surges having killed large areas native forest.Both teams made Nuthatch sightings in May, and the UEA team were lucky enough to capture the elusive bird on film.Dr Diana Bell, from UEA's School of Biological Sciences, said: \"The Bahama Nuthatch is a critically endangered species, threatened by habitat destruction and degradation, invasive species, tourist developments, fires and hurricane damage.\"Our researchers looked for the bird across 464 survey points in 34,000 hectares of pine forest. It must have been like looking for a needle in a hay stack. They played out a recording of the bird's distinctive call in order to attract it.\"As well as searching for the elusive bird, they also collected environmental data to better understand its habitat preferences and surveyed the extent of hurricane and fire damage,\" she added.\"Matthew Gardner said: \"We were the first to undertake such an exhaustive search through 700km of forest on foot.\"We had been scouring the forest for about six weeks, and had almost lost hope. At that point we'd walked about 400km. Then, I suddenly heard its distinctive call and saw the unmistakable shape of a Nuthatch descending towards me. I shouted with joy, I was ecstatic!\"The UEA team made six Nuthatch sightings in total, and McKenzie's team independently made five sightings, using different methods, in the same small area of forest -- including a sighting of what they believe to be two birds together.Mr Gardner said: \"During three months of intensive searching we made six Bahama Nuthatch sightings. Our search was extremely thorough but we never saw two birds together, so we had thought there might only be one left in existence.\"\"The other team have reported seeing two together so that is promising. However, these findings place the species on the verge of extinction and certainly amongst the world's most critically endangered birds.\"\"We also don't know the sex of the birds. In many cases when birds dwindle to such small numbers, any remaining birds are usually male.\"\"The photographs clearly show this distinctive species and cannot be anything else\" said Michael Parr, President of American Bird Conservancy and a UEA alumnus.\"Fortunately this is not a hard bird to identify, but it was certainly a hard bird to find,\" he added.The Nuthatch was spotted in a small area known as Lucaya Estates. During the research project, birds were seen and heard in three distinct but nearby locations within this area.Researcher Zeko McKenzie said: \"Although the Bahama Nuthatch has declined precipitously, we are encouraged by the engagement of conservation scientists who are now looking for ways to save and recover the species.\"The UEA team however are less optimistic as the exact drivers of the precipitous decline of the bird are still unclear.Dr Diana Bell said: \"Sadly, we think that the chances of bringing this bird back from the brink of extinction are very slim -- due to the very low numbers left, and because we are not sure of the precise drivers for its decline.\"But it is still absolutely crucial that conservation efforts in the native Caribbean pine forest do not lapse as it is such an important habitat for other endemic birds including the Bahama Swallow, Bahama Warbler and Bahama Yellowthroat.\"The habitat is also incredibly important for North American migrants including the Kirtlands Warbler,\" she added.Ellsworth Weir, Grand Bahama Parks Manager at the Bahamas National Trust, said: \"It has been a pleasure for The Bahamas National Trust to host both Matthew and David as they conducted this very important research on Grand Bahama.\"\"Their work has taken them across the length and breadth of the island in what was likely the most in depth search to be conducted. Their research, which was inclusive of bird and habitat surveys, has helped to answer questions that some residents have been asking for some time.\"\"Sadly, we realize now that we are faced with a very dire situation regarding the Bahama Nuthatch. We wouldn't have realized the extent of the issue without the persistent efforts of David and Matthew.\"A short video is available here:"}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_93", "content": "They found the record number of tropical cyclones that occurred in 2005 (28 storms) is close to the maximum number that might occur in this region given existing climate conditions. This information is useful for risk management because the year 2005 has already been extensively studied and its tropical cyclone hazards and risks to infrastructure are well known. Thus, it could serve as a tropical cyclone risk benchmark for future hurricane seasons in this basin.The year 2005 was certainly the biggest year for tropical storm and hurricane numbers in the Atlantic since the 1940s and, by some measures, the biggest for at least 150 years. There were so many tropical storms in 2005 that the U.S. National Hurricane Center ran out of tropical cyclone names; by late in the hurricane season, they resorted to calling tropical storms by letters of the Greek alphabet. It is of considerable interest whether a year like 2005 might occur again, and how often, not only for hurricane forecasters but for emergency and risk managers throughout the North Atlantic region.In this study, thousands of years of climate model simulations were examined to see if they could produce climate conditions more favourable for tropical cyclone formation in this region than occurred in 2005. The statistical relationship between climate conditions during the tropical cyclone season and tropical cyclone formation has been previously calculated using a variety of indices, which were examined in this study. The year-to-year simulated variations of these indices in the climate models were compared to total observed tropical cyclone numbers in 2005, but the models only exceeded the observed 2005 numbers rarely, about 1% of the time, and maximum index values simulated in the models were still comparable to 2005 numbers.Lead author, Dr. Sally Lavender of CSIRO said \"It's hard for the Atlantic climate to generate a lot more tropical cyclones in this region than occurred in 2005. Even when we looked at thousands of years of climate model simulations, they didn't really indicate a convincing possibility of many more tropical storms.\"While the study does provide an estimate of the maximum number of tropical cyclones in the Atlantic, there are important remaining issues. \"The indices do show generally good relationships between climate and tropical cyclone formation rates, but they are not perfect,\" added Dr. Louis-Philippe Caron (BSC), \"and the climate model simulations of the Atlantic climate could be improved.\"The work was sponsored by the Risk Prediction Initiative (RPI) and had further input from Stockholm University's Bolin Centre for Climate Research. Dr. Mark Guishard of RPI said, \"This work is important in the context of risk management, so it's not surprising that our industry sponsors were keen to support this research.\" RPI is a science-business partnership based at the Bermuda Institute of Ocean Sciences, supporting researchers in academia and providing independent insights for decision makers in the insurance industry.The study also does not directly examine the potential for damage caused by the storms. Hurricane damage in a season is correlated with the overall number of hurricanes, but there is variation within those hurricanes as to the extent of that damage -- an issue that Dr. Lavender and her colleagues plan on looking into in an upcoming study."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_94", "content": "OMG's first two years of operations already collected the most comprehensive data available on the subject, but OMG Principal Investigator Josh Willis of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California, is hungry for more. \"We're beginning to see some surprising changes in the ocean, just since the start of OMG in 2016, that are affecting the ice,\" said Willis, an oceanographer at JPL. \"We want to see if those changes are still there after two years, and if they're spreading farther along the Greenland coast.\"Willis and Project Manager Steve Dinardo, also of JPL, are leaving for Greenland this week on an airborne campaign to do just that. For the third year in a row, they will drop about 250 probes just offshore all around the island, with some drops close to the fronts of ocean-terminating glaciers. The probes sink 3,000 feet (1,000 meters) into the seawater, recording temperature and salinity as they go. The researchers hope to make their first flight on Aug 22 and complete the work in two to three weeks, depending on weather.Unfortunately for OMG, the best time to drop probes into the ocean around Greenland -- the time with the most open water -- is during hurricane season. \"Hurricanes go up to Greenland to die,\" said Dinardo. \"In 2016, there were days the winds were so strong we couldn't even open the hangar doors.\" Weather groundings stretched the planned three-week deployment to five weeks.In 2017, weather struck closer to home: Hurricane Harvey sidelined the Houston-based plane and crew just days before the campaign was scheduled to begin. Dinardo managed to locate a viable alternative aircraft and get the OMG team airborne within a month of the originally planned start.This year's new plane and new base should improve OMG's weather odds. The plane, a Basler BT-67 operated by NASA contractor Airtec, can take off and land on a shorter runway than either of the planes OMG previously used. That allows the team to base their east coast operations in Kulusuk, a small airport in southeastern Greenland, rather than a larger airport in Iceland. The lengthy \"commute\" from Iceland cut into the time available for research on each flight, and the longer flight path meant more places where there might be bad weather.When they complete the east coast drops, the team will move to Thule, a U.S. air base in northwestern Greenland, for drops on the western side of the island.\"Being in Greenland the whole time, we can get a little more up close and personal with the ice sheet and glaciers,\" Willis said.The changing ocean around Greenland affects living creatures as well as glaciers. Narwhals -- smallish whales with long single tusks -- are uniquely adapted to Arctic waters, moving seasonally from the open ocean to the glacier fronts of Greenland and Canada. Kristin Laidre, a research scientist at the University of Washington in Seattle, studies these elusive mammals and their habitats. She quickly saw the value of OMG's observations, publishing the first peer-reviewed paper to use OMG data.Laidre and Ian Fenty of JPL, an OMG co-principal investigator, are on the west side of Greenland from the airborne OMG team this week, on a six-day research cruise. Their team will place moorings in front of three important glaciers in northwestern Greenland, with acoustic recorders and OMG data loggers attached to the mooring chains. These instruments will log ocean temperature and conductivity (used to calculate salinity) and detections of narwhals.This intensive local data set is likely to add new insights into OMG's larger-scale measurements, Fenty said. \"Because the instruments will take measurements every hour for two years, we will get a totally new understanding of the changing ocean close to the ice,\" he noted. \"These data will help us interpret our OMG probe data and allow us to evaluate and improve our [computer] simulations of the ocean currents in the area.\"Laidre said, \"We don't know a lot about what's important to narwhals -- how physical oceanography influences their habitat preferences. OMG is collecting really detailed information on the physics of the system. For us, having access to those data and working with the OMG investigators can bring us a long way in studying these animals.\""}

Additionally, children are more likely to be affected by respiratory disease, renal disease, electrolyte imbalance and fever during persistent hot episodes. Heat waves have also been shown to exacerbate allergens and air pollution which impact children more severely than adults because of their underdeveloped respiratory and immune systems and their relatively high rates of respiration.Increasing temperatures may expand the potential range of many vector-borne diseases including the Zika virus which, following the 2015 epidemic, has profoundly affected the lives of children and their families across Latin America and the Caribbean. Even children who were asymptomatic at birth may also develop problems later in life.After Hurricane Maria made landfall in Puerto Rico in September 2017 medical responders encountered increases in gastroenteritis, asthma exacerbations and skin infections. Children were also at increased risk for mosquito-borne diseases such as Chikungunya and Dengue, as well as leptospirosis through the drinking of contaminated water. Flood waters from Hurricane Harvey a few weeks earlier dropped record breaking rain. Most of the Harvey-related toxic releases were never publicized and the long-term implications for children's health is unknown. Studies suggest that climate change is increasing the intensity of North Atlantic hurricanes and the likelihood that the severe consequences for children's health will grow.In rural households droughts can have significant impacts on child development through increased food insecurity and dietary changes. Droughts may also contribute to conflict and forced migration in resource poor settings, thereby increasing children's vulnerability to a wide range of health issues.To begin to address the specific needs of children confronted with climate-change related health disasters, Thomson and colleagues are proposing the following:Co-authors are Lawrence Stanberry, Columbia Department of Pediatrics; Wilmot James, Columbia Department of Pediatrics and School of International and Public Affairs."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_97", "content": "The United States has experienced many changes in severe-weather behavior over the past decade, including fewer tornado touchdowns in than in the past. A new study suggests that atmospheric circulation changes that coincide with a loss of Arctic sea ice may be partly to blame.Atmospheric scientists from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and Purdue University report their findings in the journal \"A relationship between Arctic sea ice and tornadoes in the U.S. may seem unlikely,\" said (Robert) Jeff Trapp , a professor of atmospheric sciences at the U. of I. and a co-author. \"But it is hard to ignore the mounting evidence in support of the connection.\"The researchers performed statistical analyses of nearly three decades of historical weather and climate data and found significant correlations between tornado activity and the extent of Arctic sea ice -- especially during the month July.The team believes that the reduction in tornado activity boils down to how the diminishing Arctic sea ice controls the path of the jet stream. As Arctic sea ice retreats, the jet stream migrates from its traditional summer path over states like Montana and South Dakota to areas farther north, and the atmospheric conditions that are favorable for tornado formation follow suit.\"Tornadoes and their parent thunderstorms are fueled by wind shear and moisture,\" Trapp said. \"When the jet stream migrates north, it takes the wind shear along for the ride, but not always the moisture. So, even though thunderstorms may still develop, they tend not to generate tornadoes because one of the essential ingredients for tornado formation is now missing.\"The team believes that the correlation between Arctic ice retreat and jet stream migration may lead to advances in seasonal severe weather prediction.\"One of the reasons that we focused on sea ice is because, like the ocean and land, it is relatively slow to evolve,\" Trapp said. \"Because sea ice and the atmosphere are coupled, the response of the atmosphere is also relatively slow. We can use this property to help make long-term predictions for tornadoes and hail, similar to the way predictions are made for hurricane seasons.\" But before doing so, Trapp said they still need to understand the drivers of the sea ice changes and what role the tropics may be playing.It remains unclear as to why this correlation is particularly dominant during the month of July, the researchers said, and they admit that they are only at the tip of the iceberg in terms of understanding the overall effects of climate change, and climate variability, on severe weather."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_98", "content": "The researchers used official government records to calculate the number, which took into account not just those who died from the immediate effects of the hurricane, but also from secondary effects in the following months.Alexis RaÃºl Santos, assistant professor of human development and family studies at Penn State, said the results -- published today (Aug. 2) in the \"The Caribbean is set to be hit by more weather disasters in the future, based on forecast models, and we don't want history to repeat itself,\" Santos said. \"If we have a better idea of the damage that Hurricane Maria actually did, then maybe we can use that experience to inform and reshape protocols, policies and emergency management processes.\"Although the official death toll for Hurricane Maria still stands at 64, other estimates have previously placed the toll significantly higher. The official death toll counts only those with a \"hurricane-related\" cause of death on their death certificates, while other estimates have used data from government agencies or surveys, which may not be reliable.For the study, the researchers used official government records of deaths -- vital statistics records -- to find how many people died from any cause in Puerto Rico from January 2010 through December 2017. The data from before Hurricane Maria hit in September 2017 was used to determine the average expected deaths for each month.When the researchers compared how many people actually died in September through December 2017 (the month of Hurricane Maria as well as the following three months) to the projected estimate, they found that approximately 1,139 more people died than expected, based on previous patterns. There were an additional 459 deaths in September, 564 in October and 116 in November. By December, the death count had returned to levels within the historical range.Santos said that beyond those who died during and immediately after the hurricane, additional deaths in the months following could be contributed to the weather disaster, as well.\"When the area is flooded and without power, that's not a safe environment for a grandmother on dialysis,\" Santos said. \"That's not a safe environment for someone who has an asthma attack and may need therapy. Essentially, that's what we're trying to address. Not just the people who drowned or died in landslides, but also the people who died because they didn't have access to their basic needs.\"Santos said that while the damage from Hurricane Maria has already been done, he hopes the research can also help encourage cooperation between researchers and government.\"One of our aims is to start creating linkages between academia and the government to see how we can help and make things better for the future,\" Santos said. \"Academia is here to help. All of us care deeply, we care about society and people, and want to help make things better for the future.\"Jeffrey T. Howard, University of Texas at San Antonio, also worked on this research."}

His work was supported by a Rapid Response Research grant from the National Science Foundation.\"The research we conducted in the Guadalupe River after Hurricane Harvey substantiates that the large number of sewage overflows and storm-water runoff that occurred during Hurricane Harvey flooding introduced high levels of fecal bacteria into environmental waters.\"After 800 wastewater treatment plants reported spills from flooding and more than two million pounds of contaminants were released into the environment, the study reports that the sewage overflows posed a risk to human and environmental health via waterborne disease outbreaks, deterioration of recreational and drinking water quality and the degradation of aquatic ecology. The report further confirms how hurricanes and large storms play a significant role in the transport of water contaminants across environmental waters.Kapoor selected the Guadalupe River because it is an important drinking water source for several cities and is used in part for recreational activities. The river runs from Kerr County, Texas to the San Antonio Bay in the Gulf of Mexico. Excessive rainfall from Hurricane Harvey resulted in major flooding over the Guadalupe River in Victoria, Texas. The river crested at 32 feet, around 10 feet above flood stage.Notably, all initial water samples collected from the flooded regions of the Guadalupe River by Kapoor and his students contained During Spring Break 2018, officials published alerts concerning fecal matter at some Texas beaches. While Kapoor says it's too early to tell if those beaches were impacted as a result of Hurricane Harvey, he notes that he and his students observed elevated levels of fecal bacteria at flooded sites even two to three months after Harvey.The UTSA environmental engineering professor is hopeful that his research on the short and long-term effects of Hurricane Harvey's flooding will lead to the development of a predictive framework to assess wastewater contamination following severe flooding.\"We are conducting research at UTSA on the mobilization of microbial contaminants and the length of time they persist in affected areas,\" he said. \"The results will improve how scientists evaluate the human health impacts of contaminants mobilized and deposited by floodwaters.\""}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_100", "content": "On September 6, three hurricanes advanced in a menacing line across the Atlantic Ocean. Category 5 Hurricane Irma ravaged Barbuda in the Caribbean's Leeward Islands in the early morning and churned onward to St. Marin, St. Barthelemy, Anguilla and the Virgin Islands, causing massive damage. Tropical Storm Katia hovered in the Gulf of Mexico and Tropical Storm Jose approached from the open ocean. Both were upgraded to hurricane status later that day.On the surface of the Sun, 150 million kilometers (93 million miles) away, another storm was brewing. A class X-2.2 and major class X-9.3 solar flare erupted on the morning of September 6 at about 8 a.m. local time. NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center warned of a strong radio blackout over most the sunlit side of Earth, including the Caribbean.Amateur radio operators assisting with emergency communications in the islands reported to the Hurricane Watch Net that radio communications went down for most of the morning and early afternoon on September 6 because of the Sun's activity, according to the new study. French civil aviation reported a 90-minute loss of communication with a cargo plane, according to the study's authors, and NOAA reported on September 14 that high frequency radio, used by aviation, maritime, ham radio, and other emergency bands, was unavailable for up to eight hours on September 6.Another large class-X flare erupted from the Sun on September 10, disrupting radio communication for three hours. The disruption came as the Caribbean community coped with Category 4 Hurricane Jose's brush with the Leeward Islands and the Bahamas, and Irma's passage over Little Inagua in the Bahamas on September 8 and passage over Cuba on September 9.\"Space weather and Earth weather aligned to heighten an already tense situation in the Caribbean,\" said Rob Redmon, a space scientist with NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information in Boulder, Colorado, and the lead author of the new study. \"If I head on over to my amateur radio operator, and they have been transmitting messages for me, whether it be for moving equipment or finding people or just saying I'm okay to somebody else, suddenly I can't do that on this day, and that would be pretty stressful.\"Bobby Graves, an experienced ham radio operator who manages the Hurricane Watch Net from his home near Jackson, Mississippi, said the flares caused communications to go down for hours. The Hurricane Watch Net is a group of licensed amateur radio operators trained and organized to provide communications support to the National Hurricane Center during storm emergencies.\"You can hear a solar flare on the air as it's taking place. It's like hearing bacon fry in a pan, it just all of a sudden gets real staticky and then it's like someone just turns the light completely off, you don't hear anything. And that's what happened this last year on two occasions,\" Graves said. \"We had to wait 'til the power of those solar flares weakened so that our signals could actually bounce back off the atmosphere. It was a helpless situation.\"The new study detailing the activity on the Sun and its effects on radio communications from September 4 -- 13 serves as an overview to a collection of journal articles in The information in the study could help scientists improve space weather forecasting and response, according to the study's authors. By understanding how the events on the Sun and Earth unfolded, scientists can better understand how to forecast and prepare for future events, they said.The new study shows the solar flares affected shortwave radio communications, which were being used by amateurs and professionals in emergency response efforts, although it does not detail how emergency efforts may have been affected by the radio blackout.\"Safeguards put in place to prevent dangerous disruption to GPS from solar events worked,\" said Mike Hapgood, head of space weather at Rutherford Appleton Laboratory in the United Kingdom, and a scientist not connected to the new study. \"In many ways, we were ready. Some things that could have caused big problems didn't, but shortwave radio is always tricky to use during solar events. But good radio operators are aware of the events and will work hard to overcome problems.\"\"It's the Sun reminding us that it's there,\" Hapgood added. \"The Sun's been very quiet for the last 10 years. It reminds people not to be complacent.\"The 2017 flares were the largest since 2005 and the best documented solar storm to date, observed from a fleet of spacecraft between the Earth and the Sun, in Earth's orbit, on Earth and Mars.Solar flares release bursts of X-rays from the Sun that travel outwards in all directions at the speed of light. Strong flares can disrupt radio and aviation communications. Space weather forecasters have only minutes to broadcast warnings to spacecraft, aviation and other administrators before affects are felt on Earth.X-rays from solar flares interact with Earth's atmosphere 50-1000 kilometers (30-600 miles) above the Earth, in a region called the ionosphere. Shortwave radio communication works by bouncing signals off the ionosphere and refracting them back to Earth. When the Sun releases a burst of x-rays, like the flares released in early September, the extra energy delivered to the ionosphere can cause it to absorb high frequency radio signals, like those used by ham radio enthusiasts.The September 6 and 10 flares were also accompanied by bursts of high energy solar material explosively ejected from the Sun in an expanding bubble much larger than the Earth. Such coronal mass ejections, which arrive within one to three days, have the potential to wreck the most havoc on human technology. The geomagnetic storms generated by coronal mass ejections can damage power grids, confuse GPS systems and damage or disrupt communication with spacecraft, including weather satellites.NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center issued warnings for potentially severe geomagnetic storms for September 7-9.The unexpected burst of space weather coincided with high hurricane activity in the Atlantic Ocean.Irma, one of the most powerful Atlantic hurricanes on record with sustained winds of 287 kilometers per hour (175 miles per hour), hit the tiny island of Barbuda at maximum intensity, razing 95 percent of its buildings. The storm destroyed most homes and much infrastructure on St. Martin, Anguilla, Great Inagua and Crooked Island in the Bahamas, and the U.S. and British Virgin Islands. It caused power outages and damage in the Cuban Keys, Turks and Caicos and the southeastern United States. Wind and rain from the storm killed 37 people in the Caribbean and 10 on the U.S. mainland, according the National Hurricane Center.During the September crisis, the Caribbean Emergency and Weather Net logged many \"radiograms\" relaying survival notes between anxious family members on the islands and the mainland via ham radio operators, Redmon said.\"Seeing that logbook really brought home to me the human dimension of the storm,\" Redmon said. \"It put the humanity in the science.\"Ham radio hobbyists routinely volunteer to disseminate hazard information from the National Weather Service to island communities and ships during major storms, report real-time ground conditions and damages back to the National Hurricane Center, and assist the Red Cross with communications.Graves, the ham radio operator, said many people trapped by storms appreciate hearing a friendly voice over amateur radio relaying the latest weather update, even if they are not able to reply. During a storm, ham radio volunteers strain to listen for lone stations in the affected area that may still be transmitting, Graves said.\"A lot of folks in the area were asking us: We heard there's Jose coming behind Irma, what's this thing going to do?\" he said."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_101", "content": "The flood maps are possible thanks to one of the innovations of the CYGNSS constellation. The microwave signal the CYGNSS satellites use to detect wind speed based on the choppiness of the ocean is actually not generated by the satellites at all. Instead the satellites use the constant and ubiquitous signals from the Global Positioning Satellite (GPS) system, which is also responsive to reflections from standing water and the amount of moisture in the soil.\"Before about 2015, people had inklings that you could use GPS reflection data over land to look at various things, but there hadn't been many observations to prove it,\" said Clara Chew, a researcher at the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado. \"With the launch of CYGNSS we've finally been able to really prove that yes, these signals are very sensitive to the amount of water either in the soil or on the surface.\"Chew developed flood inundation maps of the Texas coastline after Hurricane Harvey and of Cuba after Hurricane Irma, as well as flood maps of the Amazon River in Brazil, which overflows its banks seasonally.\"When we made our first complete map of the Amazon, everyone was really shocked because you can see a lot of the tiniest, tiniest rivers throughout the basin, and nobody knew that we were going to see rivers a hundred meters wide or so in the data,\" Chew said, noting that the native resolution of data over the ocean varies between 10 and 15 km and it is averaged to a consistent 25 kilometers.\"When I saw the first land images of inland water bodies, I was amazed at their quality,\" said Chris Ruf, CYGNSS's principal investigator at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. \"We had known beforehand that there would be some instances of coherent scattering possible. That's the phenomenon that creates such high-resolution images. It rarely happens over the ocean and we hadn't really considered how often it might happen over land. It turns out that it happens quite frequently, and almost always when observing small inland water bodies. This promises to open up entirely new areas of scientific investigation.\"CYGNSS's advantage over other space-based sensors for flood detection is its ability to see through clouds, rain and vegetation that may otherwise obscure floodwaters. Currently, flood detection is generally done by optical sensors on the U.S. Geological Survey-NASA Landsat satellites, which can't see through clouds, and the microwave sensors on the European Space Agency's Sentinel 1 and 2, which can't see through vegetation. Capturing data from eight satellites instead of one is another advantage because it decreases the time between observations for locations, meaning more coverage, more rapidly, of flooding in the tropics. Together this means CYGNSS could bridge gaps in current coverage.However, this type of detection is still in its early days of development, and Chew and others are exploring how to infer the amount of water present and other parameters to complement soil moisture and flood data from other satellites. In addition, CYGNSS data currently takes two days to go from observation to data users.\"It's very fitting that one of the new things that CYGNSS is unexpectedly good at determining, the extent of flood inundation, is very often a direct consequence of the thing it was designed to measure, namely hurricanes,\" Ruf said. \"So now, not only will we be able to observe the hurricanes while they are over the ocean, we will now also be able to map much of the damage they cause from flooding after landfall.\""}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_102", "content": "But biologists at Washington University in St. Louis have published a first-of-its-kind look at the physical characteristics of lizards that seem to make the difference between life and death in a hurricane, as reported in the July 25 issue of the journal Hint: long, strong back legs do not help like you think they might.The hyperactive 2017 hurricane season was one of the worst ever experienced in the Atlantic Ocean region. Damage from totals for the hurricane season topped $282 billion -- the costliest on record. Hurricane Harvey hit in mid-August 2017, followed just a few weeks later by Hurricane Irma and Hurricane Maria in September. Each of these storms had winds in excess of 125 mph, with Irma up to 170 mph.For humans, the devastation to homes and businesses was extreme. For tropical anole lizards living on the more remote cays of Turks and Caicos, there was only the ones who survived -- and the ones who didn't.And that's where the researchers came in, using data serendipitously collected just before the storms hit, and again weeks afterward, to demonstrate for the first time the effects of hurricane-induced natural selection.\"Hurricanes are in the news, and it seems that they're becoming more destructive,\" said Jonathan Losos, the William H. Danforth Distinguished Professor at Washington University and professor of biology in Arts & Sciences. \"Something like this has never been documented before because it's so difficult. The timing had to be just right.\"Colin Donihue is a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard University who is conducting research with Losos, who was previously at Harvard. Last September, Donihue was just wrapping up his measurements of endemic Turks and Caicos anole, The sky was still bright blue, but the weather forecasters were getting anxious. As Donihue quickly gathered his stuff and headed for the airport, his local cab driver was more skeptical: This storm would blow over, he told Donihue, just like others had done in the past.Four days later, Hurricane Irma made landfall on Sept. 8, 2017. Donihue read the news of its devastation from his apartment in Boston. He realized his lizard data might have value outside of its original intent.Donihue had the last eyes on the population before an unthinkable natural disaster. Now, it was time to determine if the storms had been a \"selective event\" -- an event with the power to change the course of life not just for the lizards that had weathered them, but potentially for the generations that followed.So Donihue started making calls. The Turks and Caicos government was in recovery mode; clean water, electricity and shelter were priorities, and basic phone and Internet services were still not available across the islands. But Donihue had made good connections during his recent trip, and one government scientist in particular was sympathetic to his pleas. A new set of biological permits was granted, and Donihue and study co-author Anthony Herrel of the Paris Museum were back on a plane.Back on the experimental islands, it was a mess. Trees were down and tree-limbs strewn about, making it difficult to walk in some places. But there were signs of life.\"Heading back to Pine Cay, we weren't sure what we'd find, but when we got to the field and saw a few lizards running around, we were eager to get catching and start measuring,\" said Donihue, who holds a National Science Foundation (NSF)-funded fellowship that will bring him to Washington University in the winter of 2019.\"We walked exactly the same transects we had the last time,\" Donihue said. \"There were definitely fewer lizards. We had to work harder to catch our sample size.\"The team spent two days collecting just shy of 100 lizards on two separate islands, then measured their forelimbs, hindlimbs and core body lengths, and took pictures of their toe pads.The vital statistics of the survivors could be compared with the measurements of the general lizard population that had been collected before the storm.\"The prediction was that if we saw any changes, they would be changes in the features that help lizards hold on -- they would be related to clinging ability,\" Donihue said. \"For example, the sticky toe pads on their fingers and toes, maybe they would be larger.\"Comparing lizards collected before and after the storm, the researchers found that the survivor populations on both islands had larger toe pads on both their forelimbs and hindlimbs.The survivors had proportionately longer fore legs than the initial/pre-hurricane population, while the long bones in between their hips and knees on their back legs (their femurs) were shorter. The survivor population had smaller bodies, too. The observations were statistically significant and consistent at both island sites.Hurricanes bring death and destruction to those in their paths. There are well-documented recent examples of hurricanes killing off large numbers of individuals from many species as diverse as plants, sea sponges, insects, birds and monkeys.\"With regard to evolution, the question is whether hurricanes cause selective mortality: do individuals with certain traits survive better than individuals with different traits? The alternative possibility -- that devastation is so massive that mortality is indiscriminate, not favoring some individuals over others -- is certainly possible,\" Losos said.The results of this study -- that the island populations of lizards both changed significantly, and in the same way from before the hurricanes to after -- suggest that natural selection favored individuals with certain characteristics.Of course, as the authors point out, there are other possibilities.\"Perhaps the hurricane blew in lizards with bigger toepads and shorter hindlegs from another island. Or perhaps the act of clinging to the branches in high winds actually caused their forelegs to get longer,\" Losos said. \"We can't rule these possibilities out because this study was the result of serendipity, rather than specifically being designed to test the effect of hurricanes.\"Still, hurricane-induced natural selection seems like the best explanation for these findings,\" Losos said.The missing piece of the story is still a behavioral one. Researchers don't know what lizards actually do in the middle of a hurricane. Do they abandon their typical tree perches and go to the ground? Or do they try to seek cover in notches or crevices within the trees? Or do they just hang on?A pilot study exploring wind threshold provides some insight into this aspect of the lizard decision-making process.When the researchers exposed lizards from the survivor population to hurricane-force winds, the lizards almost uniformly swiveled around their perches to the side opposite from the wind source -- and just held on tight. As wind speeds increased, they lost hold with their hindlimbs first, and were left hanging by their forelimbs.It appears that lizards are built to cling, but because of their stance on the perch, their big hindlimbs make them vulnerable to getting pushed off by high winds. This could explain the pattern that survivor lizards have longer forelimbs and shorter hindlimbs after a hurricane, the researchers speculate.Understanding how storms select for species survival is an important area of future study, worthy of a dedicated study design.\"We know that hurricanes are getting more frequent, and we know that they're getting more strong,\" Donihue said. \"So, setting up a network of sites that are actually set up to investigate the question of how hurricanes are changing the evolutionary trajectory of species I think could be really useful.\""}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_103", "content": "Research from a team of scientists led by Texas A&M University has studied Saharan dust and their work is published in the current issue of the Texas A&M's Bowen Pan, Tim Logan, and Renyi Zhang in the Department of Atmospheric Sciences analyzed recent NASA satellite images and computer models and said the Saharan dust is composed of sand and other mineral particles that are swept up in air currents and pushed over the Atlantic Ocean to the Gulf of Mexico and other nearby regions.As the dust-laden air moves, it creates a temperature inversion which in turn tends to prevent cloud -- and eventually -- storm formation.It means fewer storms and even hurricanes are less likely to strike when the dust is present.\"The Saharan dust will reflect and absorb sunlight, therefore reduce the sunlight at the Earth's surface,\" said Pan.\"If we have more frequent and severe dust storms, it's likely that we have a cooler sea surface temperature and land surface temperature. The storms have less energy supply from the colder surface therefore will be less severe.\"The study goes on to show that dust and storm formation don't mix.\"Our results show significant impacts of dust on the radiative budget, hydrological cycle, and large-scale environments relevant to tropical cyclone activity over the Atlantic,\" said Zhang.\"Dust may decrease the sea surface temperature, leading to suppression of hurricanes. For the dust intrusion over the past few days, it was obvious that dust suppressed cloud formation in our area. Basically, we saw few cumulus clouds over the last few days. Dust particles reduce the radiation at the ground, but heats up in the atmosphere, both leading to more stable atmosphere. Such conditions are unfavorable for cloud formation.\"Zhang said that the chances of a hurricane forming tended to be much less and \"our results show that dust may reduce the occurrence of hurricanes over the Gulf of Mexico region.\"Logan said that recent satellite images clearly show the Saharan dust moving into much of the Gulf of Mexico and southern Texas.\"The movement of the dust is there,\" Zhang said, \"but predictions of dust storms can be very challenging.\""}

Long-term experiments at these sites provide researchers with opportunities to answer the question: \"What conditions foster resilience?\"LTER and CZO sites in Puerto Rico, Florida and Georgia were hit hard by the 2017 hurricane season. Resilience in the face of repeated salt water flooding and forest damage has been challenging.Scientists are now conducting research on the role of rainfall variability in ecosystems from tropical and coastal forests to estuaries and salt marshes.

Researchers at Chapman University have learned from studying 2012's Hurricane Sandy, that we are more likely to see larger, more powerful hurricanes in the future.\"Although Sandy was a Category 3 storm when it made landfall in Cuba, it became the largest Atlantic hurricane on record when measured by diameter, with winds spanning 900 miles,\" said Chapman University Climatologist Hesham El-Askary, Ph.D.A Saharan dust event occurring in West Africa weeks before Sandy had formed carried large amounts of mineral dust into the troposphere, filling the tropical wave that became Sandy with aerosols along a majority of its path. By monitoring dust storms, Dr. El-Askary was able to tie this occurrence to the role it played in the hurricane's development from a Category 1 to a Category 3 storm. With this work, he hopes to provide more accurate forecasting for these types of extreme weather occurrences."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_106", "content": "Coastal ecosystems such as mangrove forests are highly susceptible to effects from hurricanes. Hurricanes can provide valuable sediments and nutrients that promote plant growth and increase the stability of some coastal ecosystems. However, storm surge, saltwater intrusion, wind, and extreme rainfall can knock down forests, lead to erosion, and transform plant communities. This can lead to an abrupt and irreversible ecosystem transformation.In a southwestern section of Everglades National Park, hurricanes may have contributed to the conversion of mangrove forests to lower-elevation mudflats. The mangrove forests offer some protection from storm surge and can provide habitat stability. Long-term transformation to mudflats would have serious effects on the ability of coastal wetlands to persist against hurricanes and rising sea levels.United States Geological Survey (USGS) scientists have measured surface elevation changes in these mangroves and adjacent mudflats for nearly 20 years, including changes brought on by Hurricane Wilma in 2005 and Hurricane Irma in 2017. Michael J. Osland, a USGS research ecologist, will speak on this research at the 2018 ESA Annual Meeting in August.They found that over the last two decades, rates of elevation change in the mangrove forests and the un-vegetated mudflats have been very different. While the soil elevation in the mangroves has been relatively stable, the mudflats have been losing elevation. The data highlight the ability of mangrove trees to reduce elevation loss and minimize erosion while promoting wetland stability through root production. Their findings also indicate that the effects of mangrove conversion to mudflats are long-lasting, with negative impacts on the resilience of these ecosystems against extreme events."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_107", "content": "In April a team of NASA scientists traveled to Puerto Rico with airborne instrumentation to survey damages from Hurricane Maria to the island's forests.\"From the air, the scope of the hurricane's damages was startling,\" said NASA Earth scientist Bruce Cook, who led the campaign. \"The dense, interlocking canopies that blanketed the island before the storm were reduced to a tangle of downed trees and isolated survivors, stripped of their branches.\"NASA's Earth-observing satellites monitor the world's forests to detect seasonal changes in vegetation cover or abrupt forest losses from deforestation, but at spatial and time scales that are too coarse to see changes. To get a more detailed look, NASA flew an airborne instrument called Goddard's Lidar, Hyperspectral and Thermal Imager, or G-LiHT. From the belly of a small aircraft flying one thousand feet above the trees, G-LiHT collected multiple measurements of forests across the island, including high-resolution photographs, surface temperatures and the heights and structure of the vegetation.The U.S. Forest Service, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Federal Emergency Management Agency and NASA provided funding for the airborne campaign.The team flew many of the same tracks with G-LiHT as it had in the spring of 2017, months before Hurricane Maria made landfall, as part of a study of how tropical forests regrow on abandoned agricultural land. The before-and-after comparison shows forests across the island still reeling from the hurricane's impact.Using lidar, a ranging system that fires 600,000 laser pulses per second, the team measured changes in the height and structure of the Puerto Rican forests. The damage is palpable. Forests near the city of Arecibo on the northern side of the island grow on limestone hills with little soil to stabilize trees. As a result, the hurricane snapped or uprooted 60 percent of the trees there. In the northeast, on the slopes of El Yunque National Forest, the hurricane trimmed the forests, reducing their average height by one-third.Data from G-LiHT is not only being used to capture the condition of the island's forests; it is an important research tool for scientists who are tracking how the forests are changing as they recover from such a major event.\"[Hurricane] Maria pressed the reset button on many of the different processes that develop forests over time,\" said Doug Morton, an Earth scientist at NASA's Goddard Spaceflight Center and G-LiHT co-investigator. \"Now we're watching a lot of those processes in fast-forward speeds as large areas of the island are recovering, with surviving trees and new seedlings basking in full sunlight.\"Among the areas that the team flew over extensively was El Yunque National Forest, which Hurricane Maria struck at full force. The U.S. Forest Service manages El Yunque, a tropical rainforest, as well as its designated research plots, which were established in the late 1930s. University and government scientists perform all manner of research, including measuring individual trees to track their growth, counting flowers and seeds to monitor reproduction, and analyzing soil samples to track the nutrients needed for plant growth.One important assessment of a tree's health is its crown, which comprises the overall shape of a treetop, with its branches, stems and leaves. Hurricane winds can heavily damage tree crowns and drastically reduce the number of leaves for creating energy through photosynthesis.\"Just seven months after the storm, surviving trees are flushing new leaves and regrowing branches in order to regain their ability to harvest sunlight through photosynthesis,\" Morton said, while also noting that the survival of damaged trees in the years ahead is an open question.While it's difficult to assess tree crowns in detail from the ground, from the air G-LiHT's lidar instrument can derive the shape and structure of all of the trees in its flight path. The airborne campaign over Puerto Rico was extensive enough to provide information on the structure and composition of the overall forest canopy, opening up a range of research possibilities.\"Severe storms like Maria will favor some species and destroy others,\" said Maria Uriarte, an ecologist at Columbia University who has studied El Yunque National Forest for 15 years and is working with the NASA team to validate flight data with ground observations. \"Plot level studies tell us how this plays out in a small area but the damage at any particular place depends on proximity to the storm's track, topography, soils and the characteristics of each forest patch. This makes it hard to generalize to other forests in the island.\"But with G-LiHT data scientists can study the storm impacts over a much larger area, Uriarte continued. \"What's really exciting is that we can ask a completely different set of questions,\" she said. \"Why does one area have more damage than others? What species are being affected the most across the island?\"Understanding the state of the forest canopy also has far-reaching implications for the rest of the ecosystem, as tree cover is critical to the survival of many species. For example, birds such as the native Iguaca parrot use the canopy to hide from predator hawks. The canopy also creates a cooler, humid environment that is conducive to the growth of tree seedlings and lizards and frogs that inhabit the forest floor. Streams that are cooled by the dense shade also make them habitable for a wide diversity of other organisms.Yet by that same token, other plants and animals that were once at a disadvantage are now benefiting from changes brought about by the loss of canopy.\"Some lizards live in the canopy, where they thrive in drier, more sunlit conditions,\" said herpetologist Neftali RÃ­os-LÃ³pez, an associate professor at the University of Puerto Rico-Humacao Campus. \"Because of the hurricane those drier conditions that were once exclusive to the canopy are now extended down to the forest floor. As a result, those animals are better adapted to those conditions and have started displacing and substituting animals that are adapted to the once cooler conditions.\"\"Who are the winners and losers in this new environment? That's an important question in all of this,\" said NASA's Doug Morton. During the airborne campaign, he spent several days in the research plots of El Yunque taking three-dimensional images of the forest floor to complement the data from G-LiHT. He said it's clear that the palms, which weathered the hurricane winds better than other broad-leafed trees, are among the current beneficiaries of the now sun-drenched forest. And that's not a bad thing.\"Palm trees are going to form a major component of the canopy of this forest for the next decade or more, and in some ways they'll help to facilitate the recovery of the rest of this forest,\" Morton said. \"Palms provide a little bit of shade and protection for the flora and fauna that are recolonizing the area. That's encouraging.\"The implications of this research extend beyond the forest ecosystem, both in time and space, said Grizelle Gonzalez, a research ecologist with the U.S. Forest Service and project lead for the research plots in El Yunque. As an example, she pointed out that the hurricane caused the mountain streams to flood and fill with sediment that ultimately flowed into the ocean. Sediment can negatively impact the quality of the drinking water as well as the coral communities that fisheries depend on for both subsistence and commerce.\"It's beautiful to see that so many federal agencies came together to collaborate on this important work because forests play a key role in everything from biodiversity and the economy to public health,\" Gonzalez said.G-LiHT data also has global implications. In July, the team heads to Alaska to continue surveying the vast forestland in the state's interior to better understand the impacts of accelerated Arctic warming on boreal forests, which, in turn, play a key role in cooling Earth's climate by sequestering carbon from the atmosphere. \"G-LiHT allows us to collect research data at the scale of individual trees across broad landscapes,\" Morton said. \"Forests from Alaska to Puerto Rico are constantly changing in response to climate warming and disturbances such as fire and hurricanes.\""}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_108", "content": "\"We've known for a long time that sea level is rising and that there are also important fluctuations happening on different time scales, including seasonal variations, which are the reason that nuisance flooding in cities like Miami typically occurs in late summer or early fall,\" said University of Central Florida coastal engineer Thomas Wahl, who was part of the research team.\"We can predict high tide and low tide and we know what causes sea level to vary seasonally, but we found that in some years the seasonal fluctuations are much larger along the Gulf and U.S. southeast coasts than in others, causing more nuisance flooding and increasing flood risk from storm surges during the hurricane season. These unusually large seasonal fluctuations were poorly understood and Rossby Waves appear to be the missing piece.\"The team's findings are published in today's Rossby Waves, sometimes referred to as planetary waves, result mainly from the rotation of the Earth and they travel very slowly; it can take them months or even years to cross the oceans. Tracking them, and knowing how they can escalate the risk of nuisance flooding, provides the opportunity to forecast periods when tides are dangerously high several months before it happens, Wahl said.\"Using this information can help us develop an operational tool that gives home and business owners, as well as city managers the much-needed time to prepare and mitigate the negative impacts\" he added.Nuisance flooding, or sometimes called sunny-day flooding, occurs because of high tides, sea-level rise, land subsidence and the loss of natural barriers, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The federal agency found that this kind of flooding causes such public inconveniences as frequent road closures. It overwhelms storm drains and compromises infrastructure and this type of flooding \"has increased in the U.S. on average by about 50 percent since 20 years ago and 100 percent since 30 years ago.\"Miami is no stranger to this kind of flooding. Some years the city has faced more of it compared to others and until this team completed its study, the driving forces weren't well understood."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_109", "content": "Is Alberto's early-season appearance an indicator of another active Atlantic hurricane season? Not necessarily, according to predictions by researchers at the University of Arizona.The UA forecasting model predicted a below-average number of hurricanes for the 2018 hurricane season, which runs through November 30. UA researchers are predicting four hurricanes, two of which will be major hurricanes, defined as those reaching Category 3, 4 or 5. That forecast falls below the median of seven hurricanes with two majors.The UA prediction is among the lowest of all published forecasts, which include predictions by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the London, United Kingdom-based consortium Tropical Storm Risk and other universities.Last year, the UA's forecast was among the highest -- 11 hurricanes with six majors -- and came closest to hitting the mark. The 2017 hurricane season ended with 10 hurricanes and six majors, making it the most active since 2005 and the seventh-most active in the NOAA's historical records dating back to 1851. Last year, Irma (Florida) and Maria (Puerto Rico) were 5s, and Harvey (Texas) and Jose (offshore Caribbean) were 4s.Xubin Zeng, his former graduate student Kyle Davis, and former UA professor Elizabeth Ritchie developed the UA's hurricane forecasting model, which has proved to be extremely accurate over the last four years.\"Since we began issuing our annual hurricane prediction in 2014, our average error is 1.5 hurricanes,\" said Zeng, director of the UA's Climate Dynamics and Hydrometeorology Center, a professor of atmospheric sciences and the Agnes N. Haury Endowed Chair in Environment in the Department of Hydrology and Atmospheric Sciences at the UA.A main factor in this year's prediction is the low sea surface temperatures over the Atlantic, where little warming occurred from April to May. The sea surface temperatures are the lowest Zeng and his team have seen since 2014, but similar to long-term average temperatures. The Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation index in May, which describes multidecadal climate variability in the North Atlantic, is zero, which is below the threshold at which El NiÃ±o would affect hurricane activity in the UA model.\"These conditions imply an average year for hurricane activities; however, tropical Atlantic Ocean surface easterly wind -- from east to west, the so-called trade wind -- is stronger than in most years,\" Zeng said. \"This implies a stronger wind shear, which usually reduces hurricane activities. Therefore, together, we predict a slightly below average year for hurricane activities.\"If the 2018 UA hurricane forecast is as accurate as it has been over the last few years, the U.S. can expect smoother sailing as it continues to recover from an estimated $282.16 billion in damages caused last year during one of the most catastrophic hurricane seasons in history."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_110", "content": "While hurricanes batter coastal regions with destructive wind speeds, study author James Kossin says the speed at which hurricanes track along their paths -- their translational speed -- can also play a role in the damage and devastation they cause. Their movement influences how much rain falls in a given area.This is especially true as global temperatures increase.\"Just a 10 percent slowdown in hurricane translational speed can double the increase in rainfall totals caused by 1 degree Celsius of global warming,\" says Kossin, a researcher at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Center for Weather and Climate. He is based at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.The study compared 68 years (1949-2016) of worldwide hurricane track and intensity data, known as best-track data, from NOAA to identify changes in translational speeds. It found that, worldwide, hurricane translational speeds have averaged a 10 percent slowdown in that time.One recent storm highlights the potential consequences of this slowing trend. In 2017, Hurricane Harvey stalled over eastern Texas rather than dissipating over land, as hurricanes tend to do. It drenched Houston and nearby areas with as much as 50 inches of rain over several days, shattering historic records and leaving some areas under several feet of water.How much hurricanes have slowed depends on where they occur, Kossin found. \"There is regional variation in the slowdown rates when looking at the 10 percent global average across the same time frame,\" he says.The most significant slowdown, 20 percent, occurred in the Western North Pacific Region, an area that includes Southeast Asia. Nearby, in the Australian Region, Kossin identified a reduction of 15 percent. In the North Atlantic Region, which includes the U.S., Kossin found a 6 percent slowdown in the speeds at which hurricanes move.When further isolating the analysis to hurricane speeds over land, where their impact is greatest, Kossin found that slowdown rates can be even greater. Hurricanes over land in the North Atlantic have slowed by as much as 20 percent, and those in the Western North Pacific as much as 30 percent.Kossin attributes this, in part, to the effects of climate change, amplified by human activity. Hurricanes move from place to place based on the strength of environmental steering winds that push them along. But as the Earth's atmosphere warms, these winds may weaken, particularly in places like the tropics, where hurricanes frequently occur, leading to slower-moving storms.Additionally, a warmer atmosphere can hold more water vapor, potentially increasing the amount of rain a hurricane can deliver to an area.The study complements others that demonstrate climate change is affecting hurricane behavior.For instance, in 2014, Kossin showed that hurricanes are reaching their maximum intensities further from the tropics, shifting toward the poles in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. These shifts can deliver hurricanes to areas -- including some heavily populated coastal regions -- that have not historically dealt with direct hits from storms and the devastating losses of life and property that can result.Another study, published in April by researchers at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, used a modeling approach to look at what would happen to hurricanes under future climate projections. Using real hurricane data from 2000-2013, the researchers found future hurricanes will experience a 9 percent slowdown, higher wind speeds, and produce 24 percent more rainfall.\"The rainfalls associated with the 'stall' of 2017's Hurricane Harvey in the Houston, Texas, area provided a dramatic example of the relationship between regional rainfall amounts and hurricane translation speeds,\" says Kossin. \"In addition to other factors affecting hurricanes, like intensification and poleward migration, these slowdowns are likely to make future storms more dangerous and costly.\""}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_111", "content": "The researchers concluded that the original estimate of 64 excess deaths due to Hurricane Maria is likely to be a substantial underestimate. The study estimates a death rate of 14.3 deaths per thousand [95% CI 9.8 to 18.9] between September 20 (date of Hurricane Maria) and December 31, 2017, up from a rate of 8.8 deaths per thousand at the same time in 2016. About one third of the reported deaths in the households surveyed in the study were attributed to delayed or prevented access to medical care.The study was published online May 29, 2018 in the Hurricane Maria made landfall in Puerto Rico on September 20, 2017, inflicting approximately $90 billion worth of damage and displacing thousands of residents. The storm disrupted medical services across the island, and many households were left for weeks without water, electricity, or cell phone coverage.As with any major natural disaster, assessing the loss of life caused by Hurricane Maria was difficult and contentious. For disaster-related deaths to be confirmed in Puerto Rico, bodies must be transported to San Juan or a medical examiner must travel to the region to verify the death. This makes it difficult to log deaths that were caused by delays in treatment or chronic conditions that worsened in the aftermath of the storm. In December 2017, media reports suggested that the official death toll was significantly underestimated.To produce an independent estimate of lives lost as a result of the storm, the researchers surveyed 3,299 randomly chosen households across Puerto Rico. Participants were asked about infrastructure damage, displacement, and deaths. Results from the survey showed that there were an estimated 14.3 deaths per 1,000 people between September 20 and December 31, 2017. By comparing this post-hurricane mortality rate with the same time period in 2016, the researchers estimated that there were 4,645 [95% CI, 793 to 8498] additional deaths in the three-month period following Hurricane Maria.In addition to a significantly higher death toll, the study showed that the average household went approximately 41 days without cell phone service, 68 days without water, and 84 days without electricity following the storm. More than 30% of surveyed households reported interruptions to medical care, with trouble accessing medications and powering respiratory equipment being the most frequently cited challenges.Household-based surveys such as these are well studied in the scientific literature and offer a cost-effective, rapid approach in the aftermath of a disaster. The researchers have made all of their anonymized data, analysis, and code publicly available for review.Support for the study came from Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and the University of Colorado School of Medicine, Department of Emergency Medicine, Section of Wilderness and Environmental Medicine."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_112", "content": "While each storm's transformation would be unique, on balance, the hurricanes would become a little stronger, a little slower-moving, and a lot wetter.In one example, Hurricane Ike -- which killed more than 100 people and devastated parts of the U.S. Gulf Coast in 2008 -- could have 13 percent stronger winds, move 17 percent slower, and be 34 percent wetter if it formed in a future, warmer climate.Other storms could become slightly weaker (for example, Hurricane Ernesto) or move slightly faster (such as Hurricane Gustav). None would become drier. The rainfall rate of simulated future storms would increase by an average of 24 percent.The study, led by scientists at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) and published in the \"Our research suggests that future hurricanes could drop significantly more rain,\" said NCAR scientist Ethan Gutmann, who led the study. \"Hurricane Harvey demonstrated last year just how dangerous that can be.\"Harvey produced more than 4 feet of rain in some locations, breaking records and causing devastating flooding across the Houston area.The research was funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF), which is NCAR's sponsor, and by DNV GL (Det Norske Veritas Germanischer Lloyd), a global quality assurance and risk management company.\"This study shows that the number of strong hurricanes, as a percent of total hurricanes each year, may increase,\" said Ed Bensman, a program director in NSF's Division of Atmospheric and Geospace Sciences, which supported the study. \"With increasing development along coastlines, that has important implications for future storm damage.\"With more people and businesses relocating to coastal regions, the potential influence of environmental change on hurricanes has significant implications for public safety and the economy.Last year's hurricane season, which caused an estimated $215 billion in losses according to reinsurance company Munich RE, was the costliest on record.It's been challenging for scientists to study how hurricanes might change in the future as the climate continues to warm. Most climate models, which are usually run on a global scale over decades or centuries, are not run at a high enough resolution to \"see\" individual hurricanes.Most weather models, on the other hand, are run at a high enough resolution to accurately represent hurricanes, but because of the high cost of computational resources, they are not generally used to simulate long-term changes in climate.For the current study, the researchers took advantage of a massive new dataset created at NCAR. The scientists ran the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model at a high resolution (4 kilometers, or about 2.5 miles) over the contiguous United States over two 13-year periods.The simulations took about a year to run on the Yellowstone supercomputer at the NCAR-Wyoming Supercomputing Center in Cheyenne.The first set of model runs simulates weather as it unfolded between 2000 and 2013, and the second simulates the same weather patterns but in a climate that's warmer by about 5 degrees Celsius (9 degrees Fahrenheit) -- the amount of warming that may be expected by the end of the century.Drawing on the vast amount of data, the scientists created an algorithm that enabled them to identify 22 named storms that appear with very similar tracks in the historic and future simulations, allowing the hurricanes to be more easily compared.As a group, storms in simulations of the future had 6 percent stronger average hourly maximum wind speeds than those in the past. They also moved at 9 percent slower speeds and had 24 percent higher average hourly maximum rainfall rates. Average storm radius did not change.\"Some past studies have also run the WRF at a high resolution to study the impact of climate change on hurricanes, but those studies have tended to look at a single storm, like Sandy or Katrina,\" Gutmann said.\"What we find in looking at more than 20 storms is that some change one way, while others change in a different way. There is so much variability that you can't study one storm and then extrapolate to all storms.\"But there was one consistent feature across storms: They all produced more rain.While the study sheds light on how a particular storm might look in a warmer climate, it doesn't provide insight into how environmental change might affect storm genesis. That's because the hurricanes analyzed in this study formed outside the region simulated by the WRF model and passed into the WRF simulation as fully formed storms.Other research has suggested that fewer storms may form in the future because of increasing atmospheric stability or greater high-level wind shear, though the storms that do form are apt to be stronger.\"It's possible that in a future climate, large-scale atmospheric changes wouldn't allow some of these storms to form,\" Gutmann said. \"But from this study, we get an idea of what we can expect from the storms that do form.\""}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_113", "content": "Detected by an instrument aboard NOAA's Hurricane Hunter aircraft, which flew through the eyewall of the storm at its peak intensity, the positron beam was not a surprise to the UC Santa Cruz scientists who built the instrument. But it was the first time anyone has observed this phenomenon.According to David Smith, a professor of physics at UC Santa Cruz, the positron beam was the downward component of an upward terrestrial gamma-ray flash that sent a short blast of radiation into space above the storm. Terrestrial gamma-ray flashes (TGFs) were first seen in 1994 by space-based gamma-ray detectors. They occur in conjunction with lightning and have now been observed thousands of times by orbiting satellites. A reverse positron beam was predicted by theoretical models of TGFs, but had never been detected.\"This is the first confirmation of that theoretical prediction, and it shows that TGFs are piercing the atmosphere from top to bottom with high-energy radiation,\" Smith said. \"This event could have been detected from space, like almost all the other reported TGFs, as an upward beam caused by an avalanche of electrons. We saw it from below because of a beam of antimatter (positrons) sent in the opposite direction.\"One unexpected implication of the study, published May 17 in the \"We detected it at an altitude of 2.5 kilometers, and I estimated our detectors could have seen it down to 1.5 kilometers. That's the altitude of Denver, so there are a lot of places where you could in theory see them if you had an instrument in the right place at the right time during a thunderstorm,\" Smith said.Despite the confirmation of the reverse positron beam, many questions remain unresolved about the mechanisms that drive TGFs. Strong electric fields in thunderstorms can accelerate electrons to near the speed of light, and these \"relativistic\" electrons emit gamma-rays when they scatter off of atoms in the atmosphere. The electrons can also knock other electrons off of atoms and accelerate them to high energies, creating an avalanche of relativistic electrons. A TGF, which is an extremely bright flash of gamma-rays, requires a large number of avalanches of relativistic electrons.\"It's an extraordinary event, and we still don't understand how it gets so bright,\" Smith said.The source of the positrons, however, is a well known phenomenon in physics called pair production, in which a gamma ray interacts with the nucleus of an atom to create an electron and a positron. Since they have opposite charges, they are accelerated in opposite directions by the electric field of the thunderstorm. The downward moving positrons produce x-rays and gamma-rays in their direction of travel when they collide with atomic nuclei, just like the upward moving electrons.\"What we saw in the aircraft are the gamma-rays produced by the downward positron beam,\" Smith said.First author Gregory Bowers, now at Los Alamos National Laboratory, and coauthor Nicole Kelley, now at Swift Navigation, were both graduate students at UC Santa Cruz when they worked together on the instrument that made the detection. The Airborne Detector for Energetic Lightning Emissions (ADELE) mark II was designed to observe TGFs up close by measuring x-rays and gamma-rays from aircraft flown into or above thunderstorms.Getting too close to a TGF could be hazardous, although the risk drops off rapidly with distance from the source. The gamma-ray dose at a distance of one kilometer would be negligible, Smith said. \"It's hypothetically a risk, but the odds are quite small,\" he said. \"I don't ask pilots to fly into thunderstorms, but if they're going anyway I'll put an instrument on board.\"Smith's group was the first to detect a TGF from an airplane using an earlier instrument, the ADELE mark I. In that case, the upward beam from the TGF was detected above a thunderstorm. For this study, the ADELE mark II flew aboard NOAA's Hurricane Hunter WP-3D Orion during the Atlantic hurricane season."}

{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_115", "content": "These hotter-than-normal conditions supercharged the storm, fueling it with vast stores of moisture, the authors found. When it stalled near the Houston area, the resulting rains broke precipitation records and caused devastating flooding.\"We show, for the first time, that the volume of rain over land corresponds to the amount of water evaporated from the unusually warm ocean,\" said lead author Kevin Trenberth, an NCAR senior scientist. \"As climate change continues to heat the oceans, we can expect more supercharged storms like Harvey.\"Despite a busy 2017 hurricane season, Hurricane Harvey was more or less isolated in location and time, traveling solo over relatively undisturbed waters in the Gulf of Mexico. This gave Trenberth and his colleagues an opportunity to study in detail how the storm fed off the heat stored in that 930-mile wide ocean basin.The team compared temperatures in the upper 160 meters (525 feet) of the Gulf before and after the storm using data collected by Argo, a network of autonomous floats that measure temperature as they move up and down in the water. To measure rainfall over land, the scientists took advantage of a new NASA-based international satellite mission, dubbed Global Precipitation Measurement.The study appears in the journal As hurricanes move over the ocean, their strong winds strafe the sea surface, making it easier for water to evaporate. The process of evaporation also requires energy from heat, and the warmer the temperatures are in the upper ocean and at the ocean surface, the more energy is available.As the storm progresses over the ocean, evaporating water as it goes, it leaves a cold wake in its path. In the case of Hurricane Harvey, the scientists found the cold wake was not very cold. So much heat was available in the upper layer of the ocean that, as the surface temperature was cooled from the storm, heat from below welled up, rewarming the surface waters and continuing to feed the storm.The near-surface ocean temperature before the storm's passage was upward of 30 degrees Celsius (86 degrees Fahrenheit), and after passage the temperature was still around 28.5 C (83 F). Sea surface temperatures above 26 C (79 F) are typically needed for a hurricane to continue to grow.Even after Harvey made landfall, its arms reached out over the ocean, continuing to draw strength (and water) from the still-warm Gulf.\"The implication is that the warmer oceans increased the risk of greater hurricane intensity and duration,\" Trenberth said. \"While we often think of hurricanes as atmospheric phenomena, it's clear that the oceans play a critical role and will shape future storms as the climate changes.\"The scientists were able to measure the total loss in ocean heat, mostly due to evaporation, as the storm moved over the Gulf. They also measured the latent heat released over land as the water vapor turned back into liquid water and fell as rain. They then compared those two measurements and found that they corresponded.The study highlights the increased threat of future supercharged hurricanes due to climate change, Trenberth said.\"We know this threat exists, and yet in many cases, society is not adequately planning for these storms,\" Trenberth said. \"I believe there is a need to increase resilience with better building codes, flood protection, and water management, and we need to prepare for contingencies, including planning evacuation routes and how to deal with power cuts.\""}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_116", "content": "While many factors are at play, the chief driver is a natural phenomenon that affects the temperature of the waters in the Atlantic where hurricanes are powering up, according to scientists at the U.S. Department of Energy's Pacific Northwest National Laboratory and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.They found that a climate cycle known as the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation or AMO is central to the increasing intensification of hurricanes, broadly affecting conditions like sea temperature that are known to influence hurricanes.Last year's lineup of powerful storms -- Harvey, Irma, Jose and Maria -spurred the scientists to take a close look at the rapid intensification process. This occurs when the maximum wind speed in a hurricane goes up by at least 25 knots (28.8 miles per hour) within a 24-hour period. It's a rite of passage for nearly all major hurricanes, including the big four of 2017.The team, comprised of Karthik Balaguru and Ruby Leung of PNNL and Greg Foltz of the NOAA, analyzed 30 years' worth of satellite hurricane data encompassing 1986 through 2015. Information came from NOAA's National Hurricane Center and the U.S. Navy's Joint Typhoon Warning Center.Consistent with other studies, the scientists did not find that rapid intensification is happening more often nowadays.But the scientists also looked closely at just how much the storms are strengthening. They found a sizeable jump in the strength of fast-growing storms -- the storms are getting more powerful more quickly within a 24-hour period than they were 30 years ago.The team found that the average boost in wind speed during a 24-hour intensification event is about 13 mph more than it was 30 years ago -- on average about 3.8 knots (4.3 mph) for each of the three decades studied.Several factors play a role when a hurricane gains more power rapidly, including the temperature of the surface of the ocean, humidity, characteristics of the clouds, the heat content in the ocean, and the direction of the wind at the surface compared to miles above. Among the biggest factors affecting the increase in magnitude in the last 30 years, according to the team's analysis:The team found that the biggest factor explaining the increasingly rapid intensification is the AMO. The result comes in part from analyses using 16 separate climate models to isolate the impact from global warming.\"This was a surprise, that the AMO seems to be a bigger influence in rapid intensification than other factors, including overall warming,\" said Balaguru, the first author of the paper.The AMO governs how the temperature of the waters in the North Atlantic cycles between warmer and cooler, with each period typically lasting a decade or more. The cycling occurs for reasons scientists don't completely understand, but it has broad effects on the environment. For example, it plays a big part in determining the heat content of the oceans, an important factor powering hurricanes.The AMO has generally been \"positive\" -- causing warmer waters -- since the late 1990s.Balaguru noted that while rapid intensification historically has occurred more often in the western Atlantic, that's not where the team found the increasing strength of the last 30 years. Rather, the phenomenon is strengthening more in the central and eastern Atlantic, especially to the east of the islands of the Lesser Antilles, which includes the Virgin Islands and Saint Kitts. That's the same area where the AMO creates warmer waters and boosts ocean heat content, in the central and eastern Atlantic.That's exactly the alley where hurricanes Irma, Jose and Maria powered up rapidly last year. It's a proving ground of sorts where many of the most powerful hurricanes strengthen dramatically.Balaguru notes that teasing out the effects of the AMO from broader effects of global warming was beyond the scope of the current study but is a focus for scientists.The work was supported by the Department of Energy's Office of Science."}

During this period, while the Indian and tropical north Atlantic Oceans warmed, the tropical eastern Pacific Ocean experienced La NiÃ±a-like cooling.La NiÃ±a is usually characterized by cooler sea surface temperatures in the eastern and central Pacific, pushing cyclone generation westward.IPRC researchers Yuqing Wang, Jiuwei Zhao and Ruifen Zhan found that, during the hiatus, dominant equatorial easterly winds caused cyclonic (counter-clockwise) circulation in the northwestern region of the Pacific Ocean, favoring the formation and intensification of cyclones there. These conditions also pushed more storms westward into the coastline of East Asia, generating increased landfall frequency of these intense storms.Interestingly, in the southeast region of the northwest Pacific, local atmospheric circulation was the opposite, anti-cyclonic (clockwise), inhibiting cyclone generation and intensification in that region.In conjunction with these wind patterns, IPRC researchers established a strong correlation between areas of warmer sea surface temperatures and intense cyclone occurrence in the northwest Pacific Ocean. This supports the conclusion that the higher frequency of greater intensity cyclones over the last few decades is closely tied to the atmospheric circulation patterns and sea surface temperature distribution induced by the hiatus.\"Most previous studies have suggested that, with general global warming, the numbers of tropical cyclones over the northwest Pacific will decrease. Instead, over the last couple decades, more tropical cyclones formed and intensified over the far northwest Pacific,\" explained Wang. \"Our study shows this was due to increased local sea surface temperatures and reduced vertical wind shear associated with the hiatus conditions.\"Wang and his co-authors emphasize their results also underline the importance of acknowledging that there are swings between warmer and cooler phases due to natural climate variability, even within an overall warming climate."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_118", "content": "\"It was surprising to me that so many fatalities occurred outside the flood zones,\" says Sebastiaan Jonkman, a professor at Delft's Hydraulic Engineering Department who led the new study.Drowning caused 80% of Harvey deaths, and the research showed that only 22% of fatalities in Houston's 4,600-square-kilometre district, Harris County, occurred within the 100-year floodplain, a mapped area that is used as the main indicator of flood risk in the US.Flood zones, or floodplains, are low-lying areas surrounding rivers and streams that are subject to flooding. To assess flood risk for insurance purposes and to set development standards, US authorities outline floodplains for 100- and 500-year floods. These events have a 1% probability (100-year flood) and a 0.2% probability (500-year) of occurring in any given year.\"Hurricane Harvey was much larger than a 100- or 500-year flood, so flooding outside of these boundaries was expected,\" says Jonkman. Rainfall totals in the week after the hurricane made landfall were among the highest recorded in US history, with over 1000 mm of rain falling in just three days in large parts of both Harris and surrounding counties. As a result, a report by Delft University found that \"unprecedented flooding occurred over an area the size of the Netherlands.\"Nonetheless, it was surprising for the researchers to find that so many of Harvey's fatalities happened outside the designated floodplains given that these zones are expected to be \"reasonable predictors of high-risk areas,\" according to Jonkman.The research began within days of the storm: \"We wanted to identify lessons that could be learned, for both Texas and the Netherlands, from Harvey's impact and the local and government response to the flooding,\" says study co-author Antonia Sebastian, a postdoctoral research associate at Rice University's Severe Storm Prediction, Education and Evacuation from Disasters (SSPEED) Center, who was based at Delft University when Harvey struck.The team compiled a database of fatalities, using official government records and media sources, which they analysed in the The new study also shows that most fatalities -- over 80% -- were drownings, many occurring either in vehicles or when people were swept away while trying to get out of their cars. Six people died when their boat capsized during a rescue. The second largest causes of death were electrocution and lack of medical treatment, responsible for 6% of fatalities each.About 70% of those killed by Harvey were men. The team thinks the reason behind the high percentage of male fatalities could be that men tend to show more risk-taking behaviour, such as driving through flooded crossings or taking part in rescues.The researchers hope their findings encourage authorities to identify high risk areas outside of the designated floodplains and to take preventive measures to reduce the number of victims in future floods, including closing low water crossings and underpasses during extreme flood events.Jonkman says that the current flood maps will need to be improved, but that floodplains should not be abandoned as an indicator of high-risk areas. \"Better communication of their purpose and limitations would help reduce risk.\""}

While 18 percent of Harris County residents showed signs of SPD in the period since the storm (the national rate is 4 percent), among those who had serious damage to their vehicle, the number rose to 37 percent, and among those who had serious damage to their home, it peaked at 48 percent. By comparison, the Health of Houston Survey in 2010 found that only 8 percent of Harris County residents met the scientific criteria for SPD.Among the residents who suffered serious damage and reported signs of psychological distress, only 30 percent considered mental health care a pressing need.\"The reason for this could be two-fold. First, not all people who experience signs of SPD recognize it as a problem that needs addressing. Second, even when getting mental health care is recognized as a need, in terms of priorities, something else might take precedent, such as repairing a home, replacing a car or applying for disaster assistance,\" said Dritana Marko, M.D., co-author of the report and faculty associate in the Institute for Health Policy at UTHealth School of Public Health in San Antonio.The research team, also responsible for the Health of Houston survey, the largest population health survey in the area, found that the storm also took a serious toll on people's physical health. Almost 22 percent experienced a worsening of an existing health condition, a physical injury or some new illness during or right after the time of the hurricane. Among residents who reported physical injury or illness: 39 percent reported physical injuries, 26 percent contracted infections, 22 percent suffered respiratory problems and 10 percent had worsening of existing chronic health conditions. Lesser conditions included allergies affecting 5 percent and depression/anxiety, headaches and skin rashes, each affecting 3 percent.However, in the face of physical and emotional adversity, Harris County residents also showed remarkable levels of generosity and perseverance. Of those who evacuated and have yet to return to their homes, 36 percent are still staying with friends or family. Household pets were also welcome as 90 percent of evacuees who had pets were able to bring them.Harris County residents came out in force to help their neighbors. Nearly 60 percent of people donated money, clothing and food; 41 percent gave their time and 29 percent provided housing for friends and neighbors affected by the storm.\"Our conversation about the aftermath of the storm has concentrated on changing the physical environment to mitigate future flooding. Nevertheless, our data suggest that there are less visible, psychological effects that are lasting and, for those with damaged homes, exceed what we saw after other natural disasters. These effects need to be a part of our recovery conversation as well,\" added Linder, who is also associate director of the Health Policy Institute at the Texas Medical Center.The report, sponsored by UTHealth and compiled by the Institute for Health Policy at the School of Public Health, drew data from a mobile device survey of 500 Harris County residents, ages 18 to 54, in late December 2017 and early January 2018.\"Mobile device surveys of this kind are frequently used in marketing research because of their timeliness but haven't been used extensively for post-disaster assessments. Our project is one of the first to use this approach since it offers a very efficient method to gather information quickly and in a cost-effective way,\" said Linder.More in-depth data will be included in the next Health of Houston survey report, due out later this year, which will allow researchers to compare indicators pre- and post-disaster, as well as measure recovery eight months after Harvey."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_120", "content": "Following the introduction of the English language by missionaries and the collaborative effort with literate Hawaiians to create Hawaiian orthography, literacy rates in Hawai'i rose from near zero in 1820 to between 90% and 95% by midcentury. King Kamehameha III's call for national literacy was strongly advocated by the ali'i (royalty), and by 1831, the royal government financed all infrastructure costs for 1,103 schoolhouses -- and a teachers' college, the first such school west of the Rocky Mountains.From 1834 to 1948 more than a hundred independent newspapers were printed in Hawaiian. This newspaper archive comprises more than a million typescript pages of text -- the largest native-language cache in the Western Hemisphere. Newspapers became an intentional repository of knowledge, opinion, and historical progress as Hawai'i moved through kingdom, constitutional monarchy, republic, and territory.A team led by Puakea Nogelmeier, professor of Hawaiian Language at UH Manoa, director of the UH Institute of Hawaiian Language Research and Translation (IHLRT) and co-author of this study, has worked for years to convert Hawaiian-language newspapers to a word-searchable digital format that is publicly available. The IHLRT is associated with the University of Hawai'i Sea Grant College Program's Center for Integrated Science, Knowledge, and Culture, one of six centers of excellence administered by Hawai'i Sea Grant.Recognizing the value of Hawaiian newspapers as sources of data for the day-to-day events of the past, Steven Businger and Thomas Schroeder, professors in the UH Manoa School of Ocean and Earth Science and Technology (SOEST), partnered with Nogelmeier and his graduate students to extend translation research in the Hawaiian language papers, looking specifically for geophysical stories, including the hurricane of 1871. They produced a digital database of more than 4,000 articles related to meteorology and geology.What they found in the translations was a timeline of the 1871 storm hitting -- Waipi'o, then Kohala, then on to Maui -- and detailed descriptions about the resulting destruction. One account relays \"there were 28 houses blown clean away and many more partially destroyed. There is hardly a tree or bush of any kind standing in the valley.\" Another mentions \"the wooden houses of the residents here in Hawai'i were knocked down.\"The existence of such a powerful hurricane, uncovered in the historical record, more clearly defines the hurricane risk faced by the people of Hawai'i today.\"Puakea's vision has helped conserve Hawaiian language of the past and is opening a window on the historical record that has been long overlooked in Hawai'i,\" said Businger, lead author of the study and professor of Atmospheric Sciences in SOEST.Businger and JIMAR continued to support the effort to search Hawaiian-language newspapers for articles relating to floods, droughts, high surf, storms, landslides, earthquakes, tsunamis, and volcanic eruptions.\"The goal of the ongoing work is to extend our understanding of geoscience back into historical, post-contact, and pre-contact times to project and prepare for future events,\" said Businger. \"It is important to note that there would be much greater destruction if a storm of similar intensity and track were to occur today.\"The translated articles are also being used in place- and culture-based geoscience education and curriculum development.\"These translations are important for STEM education because the articles show that universal public education during the Hawaiian Kingdom led to highly-literate citizens, always observing, commenting, communicating, and sharing information that others were free to comment on,\" said Pauline Chinn, professor in the UH Manoa College of Education (COE) and co-author of the study. \"These are the fundamental processes of science inquiry -- sharing of data and interpretations in a public forum for commentary and critique.\"With support from NSF, Businger, Nogelmeier, and Chinn searched 1870-1900 Hawaiian-language newspapers for articles relating to floods, droughts, and storms, enabling detection of El-Nino-La Nina patterns. Chinn, Nogelmeier, Kahea Faria, assistant specialist in COE, and four graduate students continue expanding the IHLRT database of articles on 'aina-based phenomena, specifically to create a resource for teachers and public.\"Incorporating articles into place-based K-12 STEM lessons provides students with historical knowledge of ecological, cultural, and economic changes as Hawai'i entered the global economy,\" said Chinn. We find students, especially those identifying as Native Hawaiian are more interested in future courses and careers related to STEM, Hawaiian language and culture after these lessons. \"We are hopeful that knowing the past can help us to understand where we are now and provide pathways for the future.\""}

However, Dr. Michael Cuttler, from the ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies (Coral CoE) at The University of Western Australia (UWA), says that for coastlines facing a direct cyclone impact, a fringing reef can protect the beach from extensive erosion.\"Reefs can effectively protect shorelines because of their ability to cause waves to break offshore, thus limiting the energy impacting the coastline,\" he said.Dr. Cuttler and several of his Coral CoE colleagues studied Ningaloo Reef -- Australia's largest fringing reef system, and a UN World Heritage site -- during Tropical Cyclone Olwyn in 2015. Olwyn was a Category 3 severe tropical cyclone that caused extensive damage along the coast of Western Australia.The team observed that the shoreline remained largely unscathed because of the protection provided by its offshore reef.\"The large waves generated by the cyclone were effectively dissipated by the reef situated offshore,\" Dr. Cuttler explained.\"The little erosion that did occur was due to smaller waves that were generated by wind within the lagoon.\"The shape, or geomorphology, of the reef -- with its steep forereef slope, shallow reef crest and reef flat, and relatively shallow lagoon -- is representative of most fringing reefs worldwide.\"In this study, we also compared similar cyclone impacts on coastlines without reefs and found that these beaches were eroded up to ten times more than the beach at Ningaloo,\" Dr. Cuttler said.While the findings of Dr. Cuttler's study indicated that coral reefs can effectively protect coastlines from tropical cyclones and other large wave impacts, it also suggested that for reef systems with lagoons, local wind effects cannot be ignored when attempting to model or predict the impact of cyclones.He also warned that the ability of reefs to protect adjacent coastlines was threatened by both sea level rise and slowing rates of reef accretion.\"These changes may ultimately increase the amount of wave energy reaching the coastline and potentially enhance coastal erosion,\" he said.Few studies before have measured the hydrodynamic conditions and morphological responses of such a coastline in the presence of a tropical cyclone.Dr. Cuttler and his Coral CoE colleagues found the results could be used to assess coastal hazards facing reef-fringed coastlines due to extreme tropical cyclone conditions, and would become increasingly relevant as climate change alters the status of coral reefs globally."}

This inability to properly allocate resources may also be behind Puerto Rico's sluggish recovery from the disaster.\"It's been more than six months after the hurricane and there are still people without energy on the island,\" said Santos. \"And that's unheard of for any jurisdiction. Usually after a disaster, things are fixed in two or three months, at the latest.\"He added that Puerto Rico's status as a territory, not a state, makes the ability of statistics to draw attention to concerns even more important.\"Statistics are the only real voice Puerto Ricans have,\" said Santos, who is also an assistant teaching professor in sociology and criminology. \"They don't have votes. They can't vote for a member of Congress, or the president of the United States. Their political power is diminished, so the only way you can create an effective strategy is to use data as your main tool for discussion.\"He added that he is particularly concerned with the increased scrutiny of the Puerto Rico Institute of Statistics and what that might mean for future data gathering and analysis on the island.\"If we do not accept what our data are telling us, we will not be able to address the problems,\" he said. \"Any local government that wants to address the needs of its people should listen to people who are doing data analysis and to allow the data to speak for itself.\"Santos said that in a recent study, he and his colleagues estimated the death toll to be around 1,085, far higher than the 64 lives lost initially listed in government statistics. The government has since re-adjusted its tally to about 1,000, according to Santos.The researchers arrived at their numbers by analyzing excess deaths on the island to more accurately quantify fatalities caused -- directly and indirectly -- by Hurricane Maria. They found, for example, that the death rate from September to October was 27 percent higher in 2017 compared to previous years.Most of the excess deaths were concentrated among older age groups, according to the researchers. Excess deaths in nursing homes were 45 percent higher in 2017 compared to 2016. The researchers also found a 41 percent increase in excess deaths at emergency departments."}

We now want to know whether Harvey accelerated this invasion process.\"The RAPID funding will allow the team to document changes in ant communities and test whether changes in response to the hurricane are transient or represent new stable states.Miller said the researchers also plan to assemble a functional trait database for the ant communities to test whether the Harvey floodwaters favored some types of ant species -- such as those with larger bodies or more-protected nests -- over others.\"There are dozens of native ant species in the preserve that provide valuable ecosystem services like decomposition and pest control,\" said Solomon, an ant expert, co-principal investigator on the grant and associate teaching professor of biosciences. \"Fire ants and crazy ants, which are each native to South America, are noxious invasive pests that tend to overwhelm and drive out almost all native ant species. If the floods cleaned the slate by drowning all the native ant colonies in the area, our hypothesis is that this may provide a competitive advantage to invaders.\"Solomon said research teams began making monthly visits to the Big Thicket test sites just a few weeks after Harvey and will continue collecting samples for one year.\"It was a cold winter, and there wasn't much ant activity,\" he said. \"As temperatures warm up, we'll be interested to see which ants come back the soonest and in what numbers.\"NSF's RAPID grants support research of natural disasters and unanticipated events for which time is a factor in gathering data."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_124", "content": "In recent years we have witnessed intense tropical storms that have taken many thousands of human lives and caused massive destruction. For example in 2005, hurricane Katrina killed more than 2,000 people and caused damage worth about NOK 800 billion. In 2016, hurricane Matthew swept across Haiti, taking 852 human lives and destroying many towns on the island.Tropical hurricanes are generated when masses of cold and warm air collide. Another essential factor is that the sea surface temperature must be greater than 26.5Â°C.âClimate change is causing sea surface temperatures to increase,â says Grim Eidnes, who is a Senior Research Scientist at SINTEF Ocean. âThe critical temperature threshold at which evaporation is sufficient to promote the development of hurricanes is 26.5Â°C. In the case of hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria that occurred in the Gulf of Mexico in the period August to September 2017, sea surface temperatures were measured at 32Â°Câ, he says.So to the big question. Is it possible to cool the sea surface to below 26.5Â°C by exploiting colder water from deeper in the water column?Many have tried to address this problem in the past.People have suggested towing icebergs to the Gulf of Mexico from the Arctic. Others have proposed seeding clouds with sea salt in order to make them whiter, thus increasing their reflectivity and so reducing sea surface temperatures. Attempts have been made to use aircraft to release dry ice in the vicinity of hurricanes with the aim of increasing precipitation as a means of dissipating energy.âHowever, none of these ideas or suggestions have been great success storiesâ, says Eidnes.Researchers at SINTEF now intend to save lives by using a tried and tested method called a âbubble curtainâ.The method consists of supplying bubbles of compressed air from a perforated pipe lowered in the water, which then rise, taking with them colder water from deeper in the ocean. At the surface, the cold water mixes with, and cools, the warm surface water.SINTEF believes that the Yucatan Strait will be an ideal test arena for this technology.âOur initial investigations show that the pipes must be located at between 100 and 150 metres depth in order to extract water that is cold enoughâ says Eidnes. âBy bringing this water to the surface using the bubble curtains, the surface temperature will fall to below 26.5Â°C, thus cutting off the hurricaneâs energy supplyâ, he says, before adding that âThis method will allow us quite simply to prevent hurricanes from achieving life-threatening intensitiesâ.Norway has been using bubble curtains for many years, and researchers at SINTEF believe that these can also be used to prevent hurricanes.âFor example, we use them for keeping our fjords free of iceâ, says Eidnes. âDuring Norwegian winters, sea surface water is colder than at depth, so by lifting warmer water to the surface using bubble curtains, we can prevent the fjords from icing upâ, he says.It was Olav HollingsÃ¦ter, founder of the company OceanTherm AS, who came up with the idea of cooling ocean surface waters as a means of preventing hurricanes.âIt all began in 2005 when hurricane Katrina swept over New Orleans, taking with it many thousands of human livesâ, says HollingsÃ¦ter. âThe hurricaneâs strength was the result of high seawater temperatures, and my first thought was that we should be able to do something about thisâ, he says. He then contacted researchers at SINTEF, who had previously been working with curtains as a means of restricting the spread of oil spills. SINTEF supported his idea, so the project is now under way.âOur system represents no obstruction to shipping and can be implemented at both small and large scales. We can deploy bubble curtains based on oil production platformsâ, he says. One area that researchers argue will be suitable for this system is the Gulf of Mexico, which is host to more than 4,000 platforms.âItâs also possible to deploy large-scale systems, for example by installing pipes across the entire Yucatan Strait, or extending them from the mainland along the coast. There is no shortage of possibilitiesâ, says Eidnes. (View the map).The US is regularly hit by hurricanes. However, there are also areas in Asia that are affected by fatal hurricanes with the power to devastate large island communities.âThe cost-benefit potential of the SINTEF project is very greatâ, says HollingsÃ¦ter. âThe most intense hurricanes cause communities major material damage and, in some cases, many lives are lost. This project is both meaningful and important. I hope and believe that we will succeedâ, he says.Last spring the project was granted funding from Innovation Norway in order to carry out preliminary studies. HollingsÃ¦ter now hopes and believes that these studies can be continued with funding from the Research Council of Norway."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_125", "content": "According to findings published in the Tree care workers have one of the most dangerous jobs in America, regularly encountering heights, slippery conditions, falling limbs, sharp equipment and electrical wires. The incidence of injuries increases after storms when unqualified \"storm-chasers\" with chainsaws and landscaping companies offer their services to uninformed homeowners. Some municipalities also struggle to handle tree damage with inadequately trained labor and old equipment. Annually, tree care injuries account for about 80 worker deaths and at least 23,000 chainsaw injuries treated in emergency departments. Many of those injuries result from inadequate training and equipment.\"There is a popular misconception that tree removal is low-skill work, but nothing could be further from the truth,\" said Michele Ochsner, formerly with Rutgers School of Management and Labor Relations. \"Handling storm-downed trees without injury to people or property involves an array of technical skills and knowledge of how different species of trees respond in different seasons and weather conditions.\"Since Hurricane Sandy in 2012, Ochsner, along with Elizabeth Marshall, an environmental and occupational epidemiologist at Rutgers School of Public Health, and Daniel Lefkowitz at the New Jersey Department of Health, have been analyzing surveillance data after storms to assess injury risks related to tree work. They also conducted interviews with private and municipal tree care experts to understand the Sandy experience and suggest ways to improve safety.Storms and the ensuing long hours exacerbate the job's significant risks. \"Tree care crews handle thousands of downed trees in the wake of a hurricane or even the recent snow storm. It takes knowledge, proper equipment and coordination to do that safely,\" Marshall said.Although there is no current Occupational Safety and Health Administration standard for tree trimming, employers are required to comply with all general industry standards set by a network of national, regional and state associations, said Marshall. She noted that New Jersey recently passed a comprehensive licensing law to assist consumers in hiring a tree care company that upholds the state's standards.\"Our interviews with tree care workers revealed a number of recommendations to plan ahead for major storms,\" said Marshall. \"For example, companies and municipalities should ensure equipment is well maintained, employees are properly trained in their native language and provided with personal protective equipment. Consumers should work with a licensed tree care professional to identify damaged or improperly planted trees and remove dead trees and limbs before the next big storm. Then, they will be ready when bad weather arrives and trees come down.\""}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_126", "content": "To quantify what that would mean for people living in coastal areas, a group of researchers employed a global network of tide gauges and a local sea level projection framework to explore differences in the frequency of storm surges and other extreme sea-level events across three scenarios: global temperature increases of 1.5, 2.0 and 2.5 C.They concluded that by 2150, the seemingly small difference between an increase of 1.5 and 2.0 C would mean the permanent inundation of lands currently home to about 5 million people, including 60,000 who live on small island nations.The study, conducted by researchers at Princeton University and colleagues at Rutgers and Tufts Universities, the independent scientific organization Climate Central, and ICF International, was published in the journal \"People think the Paris Agreement is going to save us from harm from climate change, but we show that even under the best-case climate policy being considered today, many places will still have to deal with rising seas and more frequent coastal floods,\" said DJ Rasmussen, a graduate student in Princeton's Program in Science, Technology and Environmental Policy in the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs, and first author of the study.The researchers found that higher temperatures will make extreme sea level events much more common. They used long-term hourly tide gauge records and extreme value theory to estimate present and future return periods of extreme sea-level events through the 22nd century. Under the 1.5 C scenario, the frequency of extreme sea level events is still expected to increase. For example, by the end of the 21st century, New York City is expected to experience one Hurricane Sandy-like flood event every five years.Extreme sea levels can arise from high tides or storm surge or a combination of surge and tide (sometimes called the storm tide). When driven by hurricanes or other large storms, extreme sea levels flood coastal areas, threatening life and property. Rising mean sea levels are already magnifying the frequency and severity of extreme sea levels, and experts predict that by the end of the century, coastal flooding may be among the costliest impacts of climate change in some regions.Future extreme events will be exacerbated by the rising global sea level, which in turn depends on the trajectory of global mean surface temperature. Even if global temperatures are stabilized, sea levels are expected to continue to rise for centuries, due to the fact that carbon dioxide stays in the atmosphere for a long time and the ice sheets are slow to respond to warming.Overall, the researchers predicted that by the end of the century, a 1.5 C temperature increase could drive the global mean sea level up by roughly 1.6 feet (48 cm) while a 2.0 C increase will raise oceans by about 1.8 feet (56 cm) and a 2.5 C increase will raise sea level by an estimated 1.9 feet (58 cm)."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_127", "content": "Using the City of Flagler Beach in Florida as a case study, researcher Chad Boda illustrates that the traditional options put forward to address erosion and sea level rise affecting the city's beach and coastal infrastructure either take a market-driven approach which fails to take into account many environmental and social considerations, or are currently too politically contentious to implement.The three options that have been considered in Flagler Beach are: constructing a sea wall, beach re-nourishment, or relocation of coastal infrastructure.The sea wall option, long promoted by the Florida Department of Transportation, would protect vulnerable coastal infrastructure but would damage the local beach environment, which is central to the city's tourism economy. The sea wall would also affect the nesting habitat of federally protected endangered sea turtles, the study shows.The beach re-nourishment option, meanwhile, proposed by the federal agency United States Army Corps of Engineers, has the potential to provide incidental environmental benefits, but is primarily concerned with maximizing return on investment. This option was later abandoned after Hurricane Matthew, that struck in October 2016, wrought such extensive damage to the coastal environment that it was deemed no longer economically justified to proceed with the project.\"Both of these options are ultimately based on a cost-benefit analysis, where return on investment takes precedence over environmental concerns such as maintaining the beach and the dunes. The aborted re-nourishment project makes this very clear. The hurricane has basically made it too costly to go ahead, even though re-nourishment would provide for more social and economic benefits than a seawall,\" says Chad Boda.The study instead proposes, that from a scientific, environmental and societal perspective, it is the option of relocating coastal infrastructure that would likely provide the most benefit to the city in the long-run, as it would protect both the beach and vulnerable infrastructure. Relocation has been promoted as the only viable long-term sustainable approach to beach management by coastal scientists; since it would provide for the beach to naturally adapt to sea level rise. Implementing this solution, however, is not likely to be an easy task.\"That option is currently too politically controversial as the local community was concerned that local businesses could lose customers, that it would cause more traffic jams in the city, and that it would ultimately reduce property value,\" says Chad Boda.The study highlights that this course of events has left Flagler Beach with effectively only one option on the table: some form of sea wall, since re-nourishment was deemed too expensive to implement, and the city's residents and politicians are currently unwilling to relocate coastal infrastructure.\"Yet this option, since it incorporates no procedure for adapting to sea level rise, will only lead to ever-increasing cost of erosion control, and the eventual loss of all sandy beaches along developed shorelines,\" explains Chad Boda.According to Boda, this indicates that Flagler Beach, along with many other American cities unable to afford ever more expensive re-nourishment projects, has effectively reached the limit of what actions it is able to take in terms of addressing erosion and sea level rise. The city is now effectively back where it started, holding the line against erosion with expensive and environmentally problematic temporary projects, with no clear plan for how to address future erosion caused by storms or to make the tough decisions needed to adapt to climate change. The continued degradation of the local environment will likely pose a major problem for the city's tourism economy and tax base in the coming years, particularly as sea level rise continues.The study argues that a new decision-making model -- a social choice model -- could be one way forward. By taking primarily economic criteria into account, a wide variety of other concerns citizens have, including those of far-away tax payers and future generations, are left out. Therefore additional criteria, whether environmental, cultural, or recreational, should be identified through reasonable public discussion.This would require not only more effective collaboration between federal, state and local governments, but also the ceding of more decision-making power to citizens and civil society organizations.\"By using a social choice model, the city would have a richer source of options and ideas to work with. Something that puts all available options on the table and requires that they be evaluated with a more comprehensive and long-term perspective.\"Because social choice involves changing the way decisions of public concern are currently made, it is not likely to be justified by current government or economic calculations, according to Boda. This means civil society initiatives would need to provide the primary mechanism for achieving the needed change in practice.\"There are many cases in US history where civil society has played a crucial role in bringing about change. These institutions could be the drivers for new ways of collective decision making since we can no longer rely only on the market or formal government to offer solutions that will protect both our environment and our society in the face of rising seas and a changing climate,\" Chad Boda concludes."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_128", "content": "An international team of researchers has found a new way to identify the movement and intensity of hurricanes, typhoons and other tropical cyclones by tracking the way they shake the seafloor, as recorded on seismometers on islands and near the coast. After looking at 13 years of data from the northwest Pacific Ocean, they have found statistically significant correlations between seismic data and storms. Their work was published Feb. 15 in the journal The group of experts was assembled by Princeton University's Lucia Gualtieri, a postdoctoral research associate in geosciences, and Salvatore Pascale, an associate research scholar in atmospheric and oceanic sciences.Most people associate seismology with earthquakes, said Gualtieri, but the vast majority of the seismic record shows low-intensity movements from a different source: the oceans. \"A seismogram is basically the movement of the ground. It records earthquakes, because an earthquake makes the ground shake. But it also records all the tiny other movements,\" from passing trains to hurricanes. \"Typhoons show up very well in the record,\" she said.Because there is no way to know when an earthquake will hit, seismometers run constantly, always poised to record an earthquake's dramatic arrival. In between these earth-shaking events, they track the background rumbling of the planet. Until about 20 years ago, geophysicists dismissed this low-intensity rumbling as noise, Gualtieri said.\"What is noise? Noise is a signal we don't understand,\" said Pascale, who is also an associate research scientist at the National and Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory.Just as astronomers have discovered that the static between radio stations gives us information about the cosmic background, seismologists have discovered that the low-level \"noise\" recorded by seismograms is the signature of wind-driven ocean storms, the cumulative effect of waves crashing on beaches all over the planet or colliding with each other in the open sea.One ocean wave acting alone is not strong enough to generate a seismic signature at the frequencies she was examining, explained Gualtieri, because typical ocean waves only affect the upper few feet of the sea. \"The particle motion decays exponentially with depth, so at the seafloor you don't see anything,\" she said. \"The main mechanism to generate seismic abnormalities from a typhoon is to have two ocean waves interacting with each other.\" When two waves collide, they generate vertical pressure that can reach the seafloor and jiggle a nearby seismometer.When a storm is large enough -- and storms classified as hurricanes or typhoons are -- it will leave a seismic record lasting several days. Previous researchers have successfully traced individual large storms on a seismogram, but Gualtieri came at the question from the opposite side: can a seismogram find any large storm in the area?Gualtieri and her colleagues found a statistically significant agreement between the occurrence of tropical cyclones and large-amplitude, long-lasting seismic signals with short periods, between three and seven seconds, called \"secondary microseisms.\" They were also able to calculate the typhoons' strength from these \"secondary microseisms,\" or tiny fluctuations, which they successfully correlated to the observed intensity of the storms.In short, the seismic record had enough data to identify when typhoons happened and how strong they were.So far, the researchers have focused on the ocean off the coast of Asia because of its powerful typhoons and good network of seismic stations. Their next steps include refining their method and examining other storm basins, starting with the Caribbean and the East Pacific.And then they will tackle the historic seismic record: \"When we have a very defined method and have applied this method to all these other regions, we want to start to go back in time,\" said Gualtieri.While global storm information goes back only to the early days of the satellite era, in the late 1960s and early 1970s, the first modern seismograms were created in the 1880s. Unfortunately, the oldest records exist only on paper, and few historical records have been digitized.\"If all this data can be made available, we could have records going back more than a century, and then we could try to see any trend or change in intensity of tropical cyclones over a century or more,\" said Pascale. \"It's very difficult to establish trends in the intensity of tropical cyclones -- to see the impact of global warming. Models and theories suggest that they should become more intense, but it's important to find observational evidence.\"\"This new technique, if it can be shown to be valid across all tropical-cyclone prone basins, effectively lengthens the satellite era,\" said Morgan O'Neill, a T.C. Chamberlin Postdoctoral Fellow in geosciences at the University of Chicago who was not involved in this research. \"It extends the period of time over which we have global coverage of tropical cyclone occurrence and intensity,\" she said.The researchers' ability to correlate seismic data with storm intensity is vital, said Allison Wing, an assistant professor of earth, ocean and atmospheric science at Florida State University, who was not involved in this research. \"When it comes to understanding tropical cyclones -- what controls their variability and their response to climate and climate change -- having more data is better, in particular data that can tell us about intensity, which their method seems to do. ... It helps us constrain the range of variability that hurricane intensity can have.\"This connection between storms and seismicity began when Gualtieri decided to play with hurricane data in her free time, she said. But when she superimposed the hurricane data over the seismic data, she knew she was on to something. \"I said, 'Wow, there's something more than just play. Let's contact someone who can help.\"Her research team ultimately grew to include a second seismologist, two atmospheric scientists and a statistician. \"The most challenging part was establishing communications with scientists coming from different backgrounds,\" said Pascale. \"Often, in different fields in science, we speak different dialects, different scientific dialects.\"Once they developed a \"shared dialect,\" he said, they began to make exciting discoveries.\"This is how science evolves,\" said Pascale. \"Historically, it's always been like that.

{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_129", "content": "In March 2017, researchers set up acoustic monitoring sites in coastal forests and coral reefs on Puerto Rico's southwest coast to continuously record the area's ambient sounds. Their goal was to capture the region's land and sea soundscapes -- especially the cacophony of sounds created by animal vocalizations -- and document how and why they change over time.But the passage of Hurricanes Irma and Maria over Puerto Rico in September gave the researchers an unexpected look at how coastal soundscapes change in response to natural disasters. Although the hurricanes did not directly hit the study area, audio recordings reveal the storms had noticeable short-term effects on fish choruses, snapping shrimp activity in coral reefs, and bird and insect calls on land.The recordings show fish increased the intensity of their nightly choruses in the days following Hurricane Irma. The clicking of snapping shrimp, which are among the loudest animal noises in the ocean, plummeted during Hurricane Maria, and the daily snapping rhythm was disrupted for several days.In nearby dry forests, Maria had longer-lasting effects on the soundscape. There was a marked reduction in insect sounds during the three weeks after the storm. Listen to time-lapse recordings of changes to insect sounds, fish choruses and snapping shrimp activity here.The results show how scientists can use the soundscape as a measure of biodiversity and environmental change, according to the researchers. Capturing responses from a variety of species at the same time can help scientists better understand how the ecosystem is affected as a whole, according to Ben Gottesman, a PhD candidate at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana, and lead author of the new research.\"Sometimes you can't visually assess an impact, but you can certainly capture that through changes in the soundscape,\" said Felix Martinez, an ecologist and Program Manager at the NOAA National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science in Ann Arbor, Michigan, who will present the new findings Friday at the 2018 Ocean Sciences Meeting, co-sponsored by the Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography, The Oceanography Society and the American Geophysical Union. \"We really need to understand when those changes are natural versus due to some kind of stressor, whether it's human or natural.\"Similar to birds and frogs, fish call to find mates and defend spawning territories, producing choruses at specific times of day and specific times of the year. Gottesman suspects one reason the fish may have chorused more after Hurricane Irma -- which coincided with the full moon -- was because the water became very turbid, making it harder for them to be seen by predators.While the fish increased their activity following Hurricane Irma, shrimp snaps declined steeply during Maria and rebounded in the first few days after the storm. Snapping shrimp make a loud cracking noise with their claws to stun and catch prey. The snapping shrimp recorded in Puerto Rico displayed a very preciseÂ¬ schedule of when they snapped the most, almost like clockwork, Gottesman said. After the storms, peaks of snapping activity at dawn and dusk were less pronounced, and it took several days for them to recover to pre-storm levels.The researchers suspect the shrimp could have snapped less for several reasons. During the storms, the intense current and turbidity likely dissuaded the shrimps from seeking prey, or else the extreme turbidity muffled the high-frequency shrimp snaps. After the storm, Maria may have disturbed their rocky coral habitats, the shrimp could have been spending time cleaning out their burrows, or they may not have been able to see their prey when the water became turbid.Post-storm recordings show the land and sea animals' vocalizations in this part of Puerto Rico, which was not in the eye of the storm, did eventually rebound to pre-storm levels. Maria was a catastrophic disaster, causing an estimated $90 billion worth of damage, but the new findings show how resilient this coastal ecosystem was in response to the storm, according to the researchers."}

Broccoli, chair of the Department of Environmental Sciences in the School of Environmental and Biological Sciences. It's a new way of studying atmospheric circulation.Understanding the climatology of storm surges driven by extratropical cyclones is important for evaluating future risks, especially as sea-level rise continues, the researchers said.\"The clusters are like rough police artist sketches of what surge-producing storms look like,\" Broccoli said. \"Like facial recognition software, clustering is trying to find storms that look like one another.\"\"We wanted to understand the large-scale atmospheric circulation associated with storm surges,\" said Arielle J. Catalano, the study's lead author and a doctoral student in the Graduate Program in Atmospheric Science at Rutgers-New Brunswick. \"It's an atmospheric approach to the surge-producing storms.\"The study covered the 100 largest storm surges driven by extratropical cyclones at Sewells Point in Norfolk, Virginia, The Battery in southern Manhattan in New York City, and Boston, Massachusetts. It excluded hybrid systems, like Superstorm Sandy, that shifted from tropical to non-tropical or were tropical up to 18 hours before peak surges.The Rutgers scientists examined tide gauge records from the early 20th century through 2010. They analyzed atmospheric circulation during storms to look for clusters, and studied climate variability patterns that influenced circulation in the Northeast. They also looked at the probability of surges linked to much larger-scale atmospheric patterns that cover vast areas.They found that the biggest surges develop when slowly moving extratropical cyclones (low pressure systems) encounter a strong anticyclone, or high pressure system. That scenario leads to a tighter pressure gradient (the contrast between low and high pressure) and longer-lasting onshore winds, the study says.This favorable environment for large storm surges is influenced by large-scale atmospheric patterns, including El NiÃ±o, the Arctic Oscillation, the North Atlantic Oscillation and the Pacific-North American pattern.Though Superstorm Sandy in 2012 led to the largest storm surge on record at The Battery, extratropical cyclones spawned 88 of the 100 largest surges there.The November 1950 \"Great Appalachian Storm,\" with wind gusts exceeding 140 mph in the mid-Atlantic region, generated the highest extratropical cyclone surge at The Battery: nearly 7.9 feet. That's only 20 percent smaller than Sandy's surge -- 13 percent smaller if sea-level rise is not considered, the study says.The water level during the 1950 storm was lower than during Sandy because the surge peaked at close to low tide. Future extratropical cyclones could cause Sandy-like flooding and coastal damages.At Sewells Point, the highest surge was 5.4 feet in November 2009, while the highest surge at Boston was nearly 6.3 feet in February 2010. Of the 100 largest surges at those locations, extratropical cyclones were responsible for 71 at Sewells Point and 91 at Boston.\"The elephant in the room is sea-level rise,\" Broccoli said. \"That will likely matter more than how storms may change in the future, but what happens will be a combination of the two factors.\""}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_131", "content": "Working in Grenville Bay, Grenada, the researchers showed that degradation of coral reefs is directly linked to shoreline erosion and coastal flooding in parts of the bay. The study, published February 1 in the Investigating the link between healthy reefs and shoreline stability, the researchers found that Grenville's healthy reefs keep more than half of the bay's coastline intact by reducing the wave energy arriving on shore. In contrast, severe reef degradation is linked with chronic coastal erosion in the northern section of the bay, where the shoreline is disappearing at a rate of nearly two feet every year.In an attempt to adapt, villagers have built makeshift barriers with tires and driftwood to slow the erosion threatening their homes, but these efforts have been largely unsuccessful. The reef restoration project was designed to enhance both the ecological functions of natural reef habitat and its protective effects.\"We are able to apply coastal engineering tools and models to support reef science and management. Ours is one of the first studies to directly show with evidence from the field sites and engineering models the impacts of reef loss on shorelines,\" said lead author Borja Reguero, a researcher at the Institute of Marine Sciences at UC Santa Cruz.The study was part of an innovative coral reef restoration project called At the Water's Edge (AWE), a community-based initiative led by the Nature Conservancy to increase coastal resilience to climate change. The researchers field-tested a reef-based breakwater structure that represents one of the few existing examples of reef restoration designed to increase community resilience and decrease vulnerability. The aim is to facilitate the recovery of the coral reef and to directly reduce coastal erosion and flooding. With support from the German Federal Foreign Office and in partnership with Grenada Fund for Conservation, Grenada Red Cross Society, and community members, the pilot reef-based breakwater structure was formally launched in early January 2015.\"Grenada has been at the front lines of climate change both in impacts and importantly as a leader among small islands and developing states in addressing these problems,\" said AWE project lead Nealla Frederick.The reef restoration structure is made from inexpensive and locally-sourced materials and labor, easy to assemble on-site, suitable for high wave energy or hurricane exposure, and specially designed to encourage habitat restoration and enhancement. Live coral fragments from the existing reef were placed onto the structure to encourage natural reef growth. This approach is designed to be replicated in small island communities, which are often the most susceptible to the impacts of climate change.According to coauthor Michael Beck, lead marine scientist at the Nature Conservancy and research professor of ocean sciences at UC Santa Cruz, a growing body of scientific studies and project-based experience shows that coastal habitats such as coral reefs, oyster reefs, mangroves, wetlands, and dunes can offer cost-effective protection from the increasing impacts of climate change. This study builds on that knowledge, highlighting the potential and importance of prioritizing and investing in coastal habitats as effective and cost-effective natural infrastructure, he said. Island nations can meet their adaptation and hazard mitigation goals by investing in nature-based defenses, to significantly increase their coastal resilience and reduce the growing economic and human losses caused by coastal hazards.\"Reef degradation destroys the natural breakwaters for tropical coastlines in the United States and across more than 60 other nations. Our study identifies how severe this problem can be, and we used that information to design an innovative reef restoration solution to help people and nature,\" Beck said."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_132", "content": "In a new study published in the journal As disasters become more frequent and populations living in vulnerable areas increase, interest in the health effects of exposure to the combination of natural and technological disasters has grown. Flooding and disaster-related equipment failures can lead to far greater exposure to environmental health risks. In this study, Horney and colleagues focused on PAHs, which are a product of combustion from human activities such as petroleum consumption in transportation or natural processes such as wildfires.Since 2016, researchers from Texas A&M and the Texas Environment Justice Advocacy Services (TEJAS), along with neighborhood residents, worked to collect data on resident's domestic exposure to PAHs by collecting and testing household dust. One week after Hurricane Harvey made landfall, researchers revisited 25 homes to collect and test soil samples.\"This project was only possible due to the ongoing partnership between Texas A&M, residents of Manchester, and community group TEJAS, who contacted us after Hurricane Harvey to return to Manchester to collect samples,\" Horney said.Hurricane Harvey, which made landfall in late August 2017, brought more than 64 inches of rain to the Houston area, flooding 200,000 homes, 13 Superfund sites and more than 800 wastewater treatment facilities.In the laboratory, researchers extracted organic compounds from the pre-Harvey dust and post-Harvey soil samples and analyzed them using gas chromatography. Horney and her colleagues found evidence that flooding had redistributed PAHs in Manchester. Sites with higher PAH concentrations before the storm had lower concentrations afterward, and the opposite was true for sites with lower pre-hurricane PAH concentrations. However, the source of PAHs was consistent in samples from before and after Hurricane Harvey.\"Although this study was small, the unique ability to compare pre- and post-hurricane samples helps further our understanding of molecular changes following disasters,\" said Horney. \"Gaining insight into how disasters like Hurricane Harvey can redistribute contaminants will help public health and emergency management personnel understand which areas are at greater risk during disasters, allowing for first responders and residents to take protective actions.\"Further research and additional collection of baseline data in environmental justice neighborhoods will help our understanding of disaster-related public health issues and could potentially improve disaster preparation and recovery planning"}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_133", "content": "And, in a natural disaster such as a flood, hurricane or tsunami, connecting people via functioning bridges can mean the difference between life and death during the event itself. In the aftermath, bridges are vital for recovery efforts.When Hurricane Harvey hit Houston in the summer of 2017, damage to the city's infrastructure was considered an immediate potential threat to public health and safety during the storm. Repairing damaged structures afterwards was vital to the city's return to functioning -- though the price was steep. Moody's Analytics estimated that repair to Houston's infrastructure would cost $5 billion to $10 billion.Using probabilistic modeling and analysis, as well as advanced computer simulation, Dan Frangopol, the inaugural Fazlur R. Khan Endowed Chair of Structural Engineering and Architecture at Lehigh University, and his research team develop the tools and techniques necessary to assess the effects of multi-hazards, such as natural disasters, on infrastructure. They find optimum solutions that can save money, time and even lives.In their latest research, Frangopol and Mondoro integrated -- for the first time -- the three most common failure modes for bridges exposed to flooding, hurricanes, tsunamis, and other extreme hydrologic (water-related) events into a comprehensive risk assessment framework.The work fills a key gap in the way risk for such bridges is assessed over their life-cycle. Their research was published in in Deck, pier and foundation failure are the three most common bridge failure modes. However, the risk assessment of bridges exposed to hazards have typically included only one or two of these.\"Considering only one or two failure modes provides an incomplete picture because the risk level of each mode differs and, when assessed together, they compete with each other,\" says Frangopol. \"Our analysis finds that any risk assessment must incorporate all pertinent failure modes of a structure.\"Frangopol and Mondoro illustrate their analytical method using a riverine bridge as an example. They calculated the impact of bridge retrofit actions on possible failure modes in terms of probability of failure, risk, and benefit-cost ratio using a logic modeling technique called an event tree.In the riverine bridge case study, all of the bridge retrofit options resulted in a reduction in the probability of failure for the examined bridge. However, these options did not provide a unilateral decrease in risk.For example, the addition of retrofit measures to prevent deck dislodgement decreased the probability of failure of the deck, and, in turn, the bridge. However, it increased the probability of failure of the foundation. Since the consequence of a foundation failure is larger, the overall risk is increased.\"Effective management strategies will vary depending on the bridge and the intensity and frequency of the hazard to which it is exposed,\" says Frangopol. \"This may be of particular interest in regions where the impacts of natural and anthropogenic climate changes are felt most acutely.\"While the illustrative example focuses on the flooding hazard, the methodology can be applied to other extreme hydrologic events, such as hurricanes and tsunamis.Given aging U.S. infrastructure, limited public resources and the challenges created by a changing climate, the need to understand the most cost-efficient approach to the design, construction and maintenance of structures is more important than ever.Nearly twenty years ago, Frangopol pioneered life-cycle engineering, an approach to analyzing the true cost of structures which looks at cost and performance across their entire life span. He has been developing the field ever since.Frangopol boils the concept down to the question: \"How do we encourage policy makers and engineers to take the long view rather than focus on the upfront sticker price?\"The benefits of such an approach? Cost is certainly one. According to Civil Engineering Magazine, a life-cycle cost analysis is helping the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey save an estimated $100 million over 20 years on repairs to George Washington Bridge.Frangopol's research on bridge retrofitting is part an initiative spearheaded by the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE). Frangopol, as part of the ASCE Industry Leaders Council, helps lead ASCE's efforts to achieve a \"Grand Challenge\" of reducing the life-cycle cost of infrastructure by 50 percent by 2025."}

In all, over the next 75 years, these measures could prevent 600 deaths, 1 million injuries and 4,000 cases of post-traumatic stress disorder, the report concludes.\"Considering that natural-hazard losses continue to climb, exceeding $300 billion in 2017 alone, mitigation decisions are more pressing now than ever,\" said principal investigator Porter, a research professor in the department of civil, environmental and architectural engineering. \"This study shows it pays to build new buildings better and to fix existing ones, and everybody wins when we do so.\"The multi-year study, Natural Hazard Mitigation Saves, was commissioned by the congressionally chartered nonprofit A 2005 version of the study found that for every $1 the Federal Emergency Management Agency spent to fortify existing buildings, taxpayers saved $4. That study has been instrumental in convincing governments around the world to invest in natural hazards mitigation. But the new expanded study suggests it underestimated how cost effective it can be.For the revision, Porter and a national team of scientists calculated how much the federal government spent on mitigation over the past 23 years.Then they used probabilistic risk assessment to calculate how much expense that mitigation avoided or will avoid. In addition to looking at earthquakes, hurricane winds, and river flooding-as the 2005 study did-they looked at fire at the wildland-urban interface (a growing problem in Colorado and California) and hurricane storm surge, which caused the bulk of damage from Hurricane Harvey in Texas.In addition to property and business losses, the new study included less-obvious costs like treating post-traumatic stress disorder, losing access to fire stations and hospitals, and paying search and rescue workers.And researchers asked a new question: What would the cost-benefit ratio be if, for one year, all new private sector buildings in high-risk areas were constructed to exceed existing codes?\"There is nothing wrong with existing codes. Their purpose is to protect human life and they do that very well,\" said Porter.But when it comes to preventing buildings from becoming unusable, they can fall short, his research shows. (One CU Boulder study led by Porter found that should a 7.0 earthquake hit a metropolitan area in California, 25 percent of the buildings up to code would be collapsed, unsafe or damaged enough that use is restricted).\"We wanted to find out what would happen if the goal of codes were to protect human life and to have the most resilient building stock possible that still makes economic sense.\"With the $27.4 billion the government invested in the past quarter-century, it will save $157.9 billion, the study found. Going forward, if private builders invested an additional $3.6 billion for just one year to exceed code, society would save $15.5 billion.In some areas of the country, the return would be even greater.\"There are counties in California where it makes economic sense to make buildings three times as strong and stiff as code requires and the benefit cost ratio could reach 8-to-1,\" said Porter.In several Colorado counties in the wildland-urban interface, requiring builders to adopt the International Wildland-Urban Interface Code, which requires things like fire-proof roofing materials, could save $3 for every $1 spent.Porter hopes the study will encourage lawmakers to invest more in hazard mitigation. Future studies will explore what society can do to incentivize builders to do the same.\"This past year was the costliest ever in the United States in terms of recorded disaster losses,\" said Peek. \"This report charts a clear path forward, illustrating that investments that we make before disaster strikes can help reduce the harm and suffering caused by these events.\"Report:"}

{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_136", "content": "On Memorial Day weekend in 2015, the Blanco River rose to a record 40 feet. The swift rise of the water is known as a flash flood, a term familiar to Texans. The Texas Hill Country, where Wimberly is located, is known as \"Flash Flood Alley\" because it leads North America as the most flash-flood prone region.The rugged landscape tends to contribute to this moniker, in addition to urbanization. As natural areas become more and more developed, floods become more likely to occur because accumulating rainwater slides off concrete structures with nowhere to go, whereas plants and soil absorb that moisture. Furl and Sharif also say that flash floods are common in Texas due to its two heavy rain seasons in spring and fall that cause the soil to become oversaturated with rainwater.\"The flooding that occurred in Wimberley in 2015 were not at all uncharacteristic of the region,\" Sharif said. \"It had rained heavily earlier in the month, so the soil was already soaked. It couldn't absorb any more rainwater.\"Another significant contribution to the tragic floods was the movement of the storm over Wimberley and neighboring areas around the Blanco River.\"The storm began upstream and moved downstream, with the water,\" said Sharif. \"This is very important, because in a way the river and the storm were working together by moving in the same direction. As a result, the water became faster and higher because it was being fed in the perfect way by this storm.\"Furl and Sharif's study additionally points out that 2015 was an unprecedented year for flooding, breaking several records. However, the researchers also saw those new records broken again in 2016 and 2017, and call for more attention to be paid to these clear, unsettling warning signs.\"We saw catastrophic flooding in Houston and elsewhere just last year,\" said Sharif. \"The winds of Hurricane Harvey didn't cause that devastation. It was the 275 trillion pounds of water that dented the crust of the Earth in the Houston area.\"Civil engineers like Furl and Sharif use the terms \"500-year storm\" and \"100-year storm\" to refer to weather events that measure the probability of a similar disaster happening in the future. In the past five years, Flash Flood Alley has seen two \"500-year storms\" and one \"300-year storm.\" The researchers call for better storm preparations in light of this revelation, to allow for blocking roads and evacuation of residents.\"We need to do better for our citizens,\" said Sharif. \"We can use innovation and insight to prevent more tragedies.

{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_137", "content": "Savage's analysis, conducted in New York City, compared the diversity of arthropods -- insects such as ants, bees, beetles, and wasps -- that were living in parks and street medians before and after Hurricane Sandy, which ravaged parts of New Jersey and New York in 2012.The study, \"Homogenizing an Urban Habitat Mosaic: Arthropod diversity declines in New York City parks after Super Storm Sandy,\" was published in the journal The study shows that before the storm, the diversity was higher in the parks than in street medians. After the storm, arthropod diversity in the parks declined, resulting in communities in parks becoming indistinguishable from those in street medians. In other words, the higher diversity detected in parks before the storm was absent from post-storm samples.According to the Rutgers-Camden researcher, the study supports the hypothesis that organisms living in high-stress urban medians possess adaptions to disturbance, making them more resilient to the effects of extreme weather events than organisms living in relatively low-stress city parks.Researchers found that the arthropods that were most vulnerable to flooding were the same groups that were most sensitive to chronic stress in medians compared with parks before the storm.\"These data suggest that one result of the increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather events will be homogenization of diversity in cities and that the direction of this simplification of urban communities may be quite predictable,\" says Savage. \"It's very encouraging because it suggests that we may be able to make smart management decisions to mitigate the damaging effects of extreme weather events on urban ecosystems.\"In August of 2012, Savage began studying how diversity differed across habitats with different levels of environmental stress. Two months later, Hurricane Sandy struck Manhattan. Savage's team of researchers began studying the post-Sandy effects in the spring of 2013.\"When the storm hit, we were in a unique position to study how these arthropod communities responded to extreme storms,\" says Savage. \"Testing these contrasting hypotheses was an opportunity to not only help people understand and plan for diversity changes after extreme weather events, but also to provide important data that would move the field of ecology forward.\"The research can be useful in future studies on how resilient urban ecosystems are to extreme weather events.\"Between Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria, the 2017 Atlantic hurricane season underscores this point,\" says Savage. \"We can now use our data from Manhattan after Super Storm Sandy to make predictions about how diversity may change in Houston after Hurricane Harvey and in the urban centers of Puerto Rico after Hurricanes Irma and Maria, among other areas affected by these storms.\""}

The 'mock orange' outpaces the growth of most native trees, and its dense foliage casts a dark shade over their seedlings severely restricting their regeneration.\"These results are reported in a paper published in the international journal This study provides good evidence for predicting that the threat posed to the globally important biodiversity of the Jamaican Blue Mountains will only increase, especially after the next hurricane seriously disrupts the canopy of the natural forest.One group of threatened plant species are the \"bromeliads,\" which grow on the stems of native trees but cannot grow on the smooth bark of the mock orange. They have a water-filled hollow in the centre of their rosette of leaves, a tank which is home to insects that provide an important food source for the endangered Jamaican blackbird, the most severely threatened bird species in the Blue Mountains.If implemented now, active conservation measures could help to avert this global biodiversity catastrophe, both in Jamaica and in the many other global biodiversity hotspots that are threatened by invasive species.

{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_139", "content": "Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria battered the U.S. Gulf Coast and  Caribbean earlier this year, bringing widespread flooding and wind  damage. Hurricane Harvey, a Category 4 storm at first landfall on August  25, stalled over Texas as a tropical storm, causing record rainfall  between August 26 and 28.A new study accepted for publication in The new research confirms heavy rainfall events are increasing across  the Gulf Coast region because of human interference with the climate  system. Climate change, caused by increasing greenhouse gases in the  atmosphere from the burning of fossil fuels, is raising temperatures  globally. Warmer air can carry more moisture, which can lead to more  extreme rainfall events, and warmer ocean surface temperatures are known  to intensify the most powerful hurricanes.In the GRL study, researchers used a statistical model based on  historical climate data to separate how much of the extreme rainfall  from Hurricane Harvey was due to natural influences and how much was due  to human influences. They first estimated the chances of Harvey's  precipitation total at the present day then estimated the amount of  precipitation that would have fallen in an event of the same rarity  using 1950s greenhouse gas levels, essentially stripping away the  effects of today's higher greenhouse levels.The study's authors expected about a 6 percent increase in rainfall  from Hurricane Harvey because of warming in the Gulf of Mexico. The new  study finds human-induced climate change likely increased Hurricane  Harvey's unprecedented rainfall by at least 19 percent and potentially  as much as 38 percent.\"It is not news that climate change affects extreme precipitation,  but our results indicate that the amount is larger than expected,\" said  researcher Michael Wehner of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in  Berkeley, California, a co-author of the new GRL study, who will also be  presenting the new research at a press conference at the AGU Fall  Meeting today.In the new study in ERL, researchers examined the observed rainfall  record in the Gulf Coast region since 1880 to show that the intensity of  extreme precipitation has increased substantially. Multiple  high-resolution climate models confirmed that the increasing trend is  due mainly to human-caused global warming.Overall, the chances of seeing a rainfall event as intense as Harvey  have roughly tripled - somewhere between 1.5 and five times more likely -  since the 1900s and the intensity of such an event has increased  between 8 percent and 19 percent, according to the new study by  researchers with World Weather Attribution, an international coalition  of scientists that objectively and quantitatively assesses the possible  role of climate change in individual extreme weather events.Even if global targets set by the Paris Agreement of limiting warming  to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) are met, scientists  estimate an event like Hurricane Harvey will see a further increase of  about a factor of three in probability.\"But, if we miss those targets, the increase in frequency and  intensity could be much higher,\" said Karin van der Wiel, a postdoctoral  researcher at the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute (KNMI) in  De Bilt, Netherlands and a co-author of the new ERL paper.Â"}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_140", "content": "In October 2014, Cyclone Nilofar formed off the western coast of India. The unusual system was the first extremely severe cyclonic storm (ESCS) -- defined by wind speeds greater than 102 miles per hour -- on record to appear in the Arabian Sea after South Asia's monsoon season. Cyclones commonly develop in the Arabian Sea after the monsoon season, but none as ferocious as Nilofar, which produced winds of up 130 miles per hour and led to the evacuation of 30,000 people in India.Then, in 2015, two even stronger extreme cyclones rolled in off the Arabian Sea -- in one week. From Oct. 28 to Nov. 4, Cyclone Chapala -- the second strongest cyclone ever recorded on the Arabian Sea -- brought winds of up to 150 miles per hour and dumped the equivalent of several years' worth of rain on the arid nations of Yemen, Oman and Somalia. Cyclone Megh unleased a second wave of destruction only a few days later. The storms killed 27 people and devastated the already fragile economies and infrastructures of the affected nations. The Yemeni island of Socotra was destroyed by flooding and wind damage.The researchers analyzed simulations of global and regional cyclone cycles shortly after the 2015 storms to help determine their cause.Especially notable is that their model projected an increase in post-monsoon extreme cyclones in the Arabian Sea by 2015 that was similar to what actually happened, said first author Hiro Murakami, an associate research scholar in Princeton's Program in Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences. It is difficult for a climate model to accurately project for a defined location at a certain time.\"This may be the first time that we see synchronicity between a modeled projection and real observations of storm activity in a specific region during a specific season,\" Murakami said. He worked with Gabriel Vecchi, Princeton professor of geosciences and the Princeton Environmental Institute, and Seth Underwood at NOAA's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) located on Princeton's Forrestal Campus.\"It is still challenging to predict the year in which an ESCS will occur in the future,\" Murakami said. \"What we emphasize is that the probability of occurrence is increasing relative to that in preindustrial conditions. It would not be surprising if we see a new ESCS generated in late season in the next few years.\"This year, Cyclone Ockhi, which formed Nov. 29 and dissipated Dec. 6, left at least 39 dead in Sri Lanka and India. Belonging to the lower classification of a very severe cyclonic storm, Ockhi was nonetheless the most intense Arabian Sea cyclone since Megh with wind speeds peaking at 115 miles per hour.These powerful new storms strike areas of the world made vulnerable by poverty, conflict and a lack of experience with a cyclone's heavy wind and rain, Murakami said.\"Large economic losses would be expected in Africa, the Middle East and South Asia along the Arabian Sea,\" he said. \"These countries are highly sensitive to storm hazards and impacts due to a lack of adaption strategies. These regions experience comparatively low climatological storm exposure.\"The driving force behind the appearance of the ESCSs was higher-than-normal temperatures. Murakami, Vecchi and Underwood used a high-resolution model at GFDL known as HiFLOR to simulate cyclone activity in the Arabian Sea under two scenarios. The first was natural variability such as some years being hotter than others. HiFLOR is able to reproduce observed variations in the frequency of category 4 and 5 hurricanes in the North Indian Ocean, then project that fluctuation onto other regions and storm systems. This results in a realistic simulation of natural variability.The second simulation factored in increased atmospheric concentrations of sulfate, organic carbon, black carbon and other compounds that result from human activities. Black carbon and sulfates especially result from burning fossil fuels and biomass such as wood, a popular fuel in South Asia. The researchers ran their simulations with the levels of these substances as they were in the years 1860, 1940, 1990 and 2015.They found significant increases in the occurrence of post-monsoon ESCSs in the Arabian Sea in 1990 and 2015 -- the latter of which matched the recent storms. (Real observations of extreme cyclone activity in the Arabian Sea are limited because there was no full weather-satellite coverage in this area before 1998.) New models are being developed to more accurately account for the influence of human-made aerosols on the creation of extreme cyclones over the Arabian Sea, Murakami said."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_141", "content": "What if there was a better way to forecast and communicate these storms' damaging economic impacts, before they happen?Colorado State University civil engineers have developed an innovative new approach to assessing the resiliency of coastal communities to hurricanes. They've created a \"multi-hazard hurricane impact level model,\" which estimates economic damages to be caused by storms, before they happen.The impact model is detailed in a recent paper in \"Our model forecasts storms more in terms of impacts,\" Mahmoud explained. Forecasters typically communicate about approaching storms by categorizing sustained wind speeds on the Saffir-Simpson scale.Wind speed, however, is not usually the main cause of death and destruction from hurricanes, the researchers say. The worst impacts are usually caused by flooding, precipitation and storm surge, combined with geography of landfall, population density, and quality of infrastructure. The researchers wanted to come up with a more accurate way to talk about impacts. Their goal is to provide communication about a tropical storm's expected economic damage, rather than only the meteorological intensity of the storm, Pilkington said.Mahmoud and Pilkington's impact model uses artificial neural networks and machine learning to \"teach\" a computer program how to predict a pending storm's damage, by dollar figure. The neural network, which is like an artificial human brain that gets smarter the more data it is fed, is powered by detailed historical data from several storms. These include Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and Hurricane Arthur in 2014.Mahmoud and Pilkington used this historical data to train neural networks to connect actual storm characteristics to actual known outcomes from those storms. To feed their model, they used publicly available data from federal agencies. Their model uses inputs including estimated landfall, population affected, maximum wind speed, maximum storm surge, and total precipitation.Then, they tested the model in real time during actual storms, including most recently Hurricane Harvey, which hit the Gulf Coast around Houston, Texas, in August.The researchers also used their model to analyze whether physical and policy improvements such as seawalls, the National Flood Insurance Program, and updated building codes have mitigated the impacts of powerful storms. In short, they haven't, the researchers say.According to their data, coastal communities in Florida or Texas are about as economically vulnerable, or even worse off, to hurricane devastation as they were 100 years ago. That's a sobering reality the engineers hope their work can shed light on.The number of people living in coastal communities has increased exponentially in 100 years, and with it, infrastructure and highways. \"Improved building codes and other changes have not been enough to keep up with the sheer volume of wealth, infrastructure and people in those areas,\" Pilkington said.Pilkington, whose interests intersect in meteorology and civil engineering, wants the model to make a real difference in people's lives. \"My ultimate goal is to have it be used by someone -- whether the National Weather Service or elsewhere,\" she said. \"We should be communicating to the public in terms of impact instead of intensity.\"Mahmoud and Pilkington are continuing to advance their model with better data, providing an even more accurate picture for hurricanes going forward. They also plan to use it to predict effects of climate change."}

Khan Endowed Chair of Structural Engineering and Architecture at Lehigh University and You Dong, Assistant Professor of Structural Engineering at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, the majority of previous studies have focused on structural performance and loss assessment under hurricanes.In a paper, recently published in the In their paper, called \"Adaptation Optimization of Residential Buildings under Hurricane Threat Considering Climate Change in a Lifecycle Context,\" Frangopol and Dong present a systematic framework for the optimal adaptation of residential buildings at a large scale under various scenarios of impending climate change during a long-term interval. Different adaptation strategies are investigated to ensure adequate structural performance and to mitigate the damage loss and adverse consequences to society. A genetic algorithm-based optimization process is adopted to determine the optimal adaptation types associated with buildings within an investigated region. The framework considers the probabilistic occurrence models of hurricanes, structural vulnerability of typical residential buildings, possible climate change scenarios, and optimization of various climate adaptation strategies in a lifecycle context.They apply their approach to a real-life case study: a group of single-family residential buildings located in Miami-Dade County, Florida.The article concludes:\"This paper proposed a general computational procedure associated with optimal adaptation strategies of residential buildings subjected to hurricanes and climate change effects. The loss of buildings under probabilistic wind hazard is computed and the effects of adaptation on structural performance are considered in a lifecycle context. The optimal structural adaptation strategies are identified considering expected lifecycle loss/benefit and total structural adaptation cost during the investigated time interval. The presented approach was illustrated on residential buildings located in Miami- Dade County, Florida.The following conclusions are drawn:2. For the case study analyzed in this paper, the buildings within 1-10 km of the shore revealed the largest loss compared with the buildings located in other regions. Furthermore, buildings built before 1970 contribute substantially to the total annual loss for the buildings located in this region.3. The changes in the probability of occurrence and intensity of hurricanes due to climate change have significant effects on the expected lifecycle loss of the buildings within the investigated region. The change associated with hazard intensity has a larger effect on the loss than that due to the increase of the hazard occurrence rate.4. Optimum adaptation strategies of residential buildings can be obtained by using a biobjective approach, resulting in a Pareto optimal front. This allows decision makers to make informed decisions based on their particular preference.5. The cost-benefit evaluation and optimization of adaptation actions can produce the best structural adaptation strategies considering both the expected lifecycle loss and total structural adaptation cost. The cost and benefit can be considered together to determine the effectiveness of an alternative.6. Within the context of climate change engineering, lifecycle loss, cost-benefit analysis, and optimization can provide the decision maker important information necessary for assessment and adaptation of structural systems at a large scale. This information can be used in design, maintenance, and management processes of civil infrastructure considering extreme events and climate change.\"Prof. Dan M. Frangopol is the inaugural holder of the Fazlur R. Khan Endowed Chair of Structural Engineering and Architecture at Lehigh University. He is \"widely recognized as a leading educator and creator in the field of life-cycle engineering.\" (ASCE). His main research interests are in the development and application of probabilistic concepts and methods to civil and marine engineering, including: structural reliability; life-cycle cost analysis; probability-based assessment, design, and multi-criteria life-cycle optimization of structures and infrastructure systems; structural health monitoring; life-cycle performance maintenance and management of structures and distributed infrastructure under extreme events (earthquakes, tsunamis, hurricanes, and floods); risk-based assessment and decision making; multi-hazard risk mitigation; infrastructure sustainability and resilience to disasters; climate change adaptation; and probabilistic mechanics. His research, teaching and service have garnered numerous awards from ASCE, IASSAR, IABSE, SAE and other professional organizations.According to ASCE \"Dan M.

{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_143", "content": "Geoengineering -- the intentional manipulation of the climate to counter the effect of global warming by injecting aerosols artificially into the atmosphere -- has been mooted as a potential way to deal with climate change.However new research led by climate experts from the University of Exeter suggests that targeting geoengineering in one hemisphere could have a severely detrimental impact for the other.They suggest that while injections of aerosols in the northern hemisphere would reduce tropical cyclone activity -- responsible for such recent phenomena including Hurricane Katrina -- it would at the same time lead to increased likelihood for drought in the Sahel, the area of sub-Saharan Africa just south of the Sahara desert.In response, the team of researchers have called on policymakers worldwide to strictly regulate any large scale unilateral geoengineering programmes in the future to prevent inducing natural disasters in different parts of the world.The study is published in leading scientific journal Dr Anthony Jones, A climate science expert from the University of Exeter and lead author on the paper said: \"Our results confirm that regional solar geoengineering is a highly risky strategy which could simultaneously benefit one region to the detriment of another. It is vital that policymakers take solar geoengineering seriously and act swiftly to install effective regulation.\"The innovative research centres on the impact solar geoengineering methods that inject aerosols into the atmosphere may have on the frequency of tropical cyclones.The controversial approach, known as stratospheric aerosol injection, is designed to effectively cool the Earth's surface by reflecting some sunlight before it reaches the surface. The proposals mimic the aftermath of volcanic eruptions, when aerosols are naturally injected into the atmosphere.In the study, the researchers use sophisticated simulations with a fully coupled atmosphere-ocean model to investigate the effect of hemispheric stratospheric aerosol injection on North Atlantic tropical cyclone frequency.They find injections of aerosols in the northern hemisphere would decrease North Atlantic tropical cyclone frequency, while injections contained to the southern hemisphere may potentially enhance it.Crucially, the team warn however that while tropical cyclone activity in the North Atlantic could be suppressed by northern hemisphere injections, this would, at the same time, induce droughts in the Sahel.These results suggest the uncertain effects of solar geoengineering -- a proposed approach to counteract global warming -- which should be considered by policymakers.Professor Jim Haywood, from the Mathematics department at the University of Exeter and co-author of the study added: \"This research shows how a global temperature target such as 1.5 or 2C needs to be combined with information on a more regional scale to properly assess the full range of climate impacts.\""}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_144", "content": "A new MIT study, published online this week in the According to the study, the state of Texas had a 1 percent chance of experiencing rainfall of Harvey's magnitude for any given year between 1981 and 2000. By the end of this century, the annual probability of Hurricane Harvey's record rainfall returning to Texas will rise to 18 percent, if the growth of greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere continues unmitigated.If the risk for such an event during this century increased in a steady, linear fashion, it would mean that there was a 6 percent chance of having Harvey's magnitude of rainfall in Texas this year.\"You're rolling the dice every year,\" says study author Kerry Emanuel, the Cecil and Ida Green Professor of Atmospheric Science and co-director of the Lorenz Center at MIT. \"And we believe the odds of a flood like Harvey are changing.\"When the past isn't a guideIn the wake of a large disaster, Emanuel says it is natural, and in some cases essential, to ask whether and how soon such an event will occur again.\"Suppose you're the mayor of Houston, and you've just had a terrible disaster that cost you an unbelievable fortune, and you're going to try over the next few years to put things back in order in your city,\" Emanuel says. \"Should you be putting in a more advanced storm-sewer system that may cost billions of dollars, or not? The answer to that question depends upon whether you think Harvey was a one-off -- very unlikely to happen any time in the next 100 years -- or whether it may be more common than you thought.\"Looking at historical records of extreme rainfall will not provide much insight into the future, Emanuel says. That's because past measurements have been spotty and difficult to extrapolate across larger regions, and the period over which rainfall data have been recorded is relatively short. What's more, climate change is shifting the odds in terms of the frequency of high-intensity storms around the world.\"If the underlying statistics are changing, the past may not be a good guide to the future,\" Emanuel notes in the paper.Instead, scientists are turning to climate models to try and forecast the future of storms like Harvey. But there, challenges also arise, as models that simulate changing climate at a global scale do so at relatively coarse resolution, of around hundreds of kilometers, while hurricanes require resolutions of a few kilometers.\"[Climate models] do simulate slushy hurricane-like storms, but they're very poorly resolved,\" Emanuel says. \"We don't have the computational firepower to resolve storms like hurricanes in today's climate models.\"Emanuel and his colleagues had previously devised a technique to simulate hurricane development in a changing climate, using a specialized computational model they developed that simulates hurricanes at high spatial resolutions. The model is designed so that they can embed it within coarser global climate models -- a combination that results in precise simulations of hurricanes in the context of a globally changing climate.Emanuel used the team's technique to model past and future hurricane activity for both the city of Houston and the state of Texas. To do so, he first embedded the hurricane model in three gridded climate analyses -- simulations of global climate, based on actual data from the past -- to simulate hurricane activity near Houston between 1980 and 2016.He randomly seeded each climate model with hundreds of thousands of \"proto-hurricanes,\" or early-stage storms, the majority of which naturally peter out and don't grow to become full-fledged hurricanes. Of the remaining storms, he focused on the 3,700 storms that passed within 300 kilometers of Houston between 1980 and 2016. He then noted the frequency of storms that produced 500 millimeters of rainfall or more -- the amount of rain that was initially estimated immediately following Hurricane Harvey.During this historical period, he calculated that the probability of a Harvey-like storm producing at least 500 millimeters of rain in Houston was around once in 2,000 years. Such an event, he writes, was \"'biblical' in the sense that it likely occurred around once since the Old Testament was written.\"To get a sense for how this probability, or risk of such a storm, will change in the future, he performed the same analysis, this time embedding the hurricane model within six global climate models, and running each model from the years 2081 to 2100, under a future scenario in which the world's climate changes as a result of unmitigated growth of greenhouse gas emissions.While Houston's yearly risk of experiencing a 500-millimeter rainfall event was around 1 in 2,000 at the end of the last century, Emanuel found the city's annual odds will increase significantly, to one in 100 by the end of this century.When he performed the same set of analyses for Texas as a whole, he found that, at the end of the 20th century, the state faced a 1 percent risk each year of experiencing a Harvey-scale storm. By the end of this century, that annual risk will increase to 18 percent. If this increase happens linearly, he calculates that this year, the state's odds were at about 6 percent -- a sixfold increase since the late 20th century.\"When you take a very, very rare, extreme rainfall event like Hurricane Harvey, and you shift the distribution of rain toward heavier amounts because of climate change, you get really big changes in the probability of those rare events,\" Emanuel says. \"People have to understand that damage is usually caused by extreme events.\"Emanuel hopes that the study's results will help city planners and government officials to decide where and how to rebuild and fortify infrastructure, as well as whether to recode building standards to stand up to stronger storms and more damaging floods.\"We're seeing for Texas an event whose annual probability was 1 percent at the end of the last century, and it might be 18 percent by the end of this century,\" Emanuel says. \"That's a huge increase in the probability of that event. So, people had better plan for that.\""}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_145", "content": "\"Sandy is the classic example. It was a very big storm, but in terms of maximum wind speed it was arguably not a hurricane,\" said Dan Chavas, an assistant professor of atmospheric science at Purdue University who led the study. \"If you looked at the central pressure deficit, you would have expected it to cause a lot of damage. But if you used maximum wind speed, as people usually do, you wouldn't expect it to do the damage that it did.\"Central pressure deficit refers to the difference in pressure between the center of the storm and outside it. Pressure and wind speed have been used interchangeably to estimate potential damage from hurricanes for years, but the relationship between them has been a long-standing riddle in tropical meteorology.Chavas and his colleagues have defined a theory that solves that riddle. Previous work has observed that central pressure deficit depends on maximum wind speed, storm size, and latitude, but Chavas' team has determined why that is.Scientists could use this theory to calculate peak wind speed if they had numbers for the other metrics in the equation, which could come in handy because wind speeds need to be measured at several points of a storm, making it difficult to get an accurate reading.The research team tested their theory on two simulations of Earth.The first used the actual distribution of sea surface temperatures and solar radiation since 1979 to produce conditions similar to real historical climate.The second simulation produced a very simplified version of the Earth. It had no land, and ocean temperature and solar radiation were the same everywhere. This made the entire planet sort of like the tropics, meaning hurricanes could pop up anywhere -- but they still tended to form at low latitudes and move westward and toward the poles, like they do on Earth.\"The idea is that if we test our theory in this very simple world, and then take it to the real world where everything is much more complicated and we get the same results, all that complexity is irrelevant,\" Chavas said. \"People tend to work in different worlds -- either the simplified world or the real world, and they don't talk to each other that much. We're bridging that gap.\"The limitations of the official scale for hurricane categorization, the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale, have come under scrutiny recently. The wind speed meteorologists settle on is often only an estimate, and it's also highly localized because it depends on a speed sustained for a short time in one location. However, it's popular with the public and media because of its simplicity.Some have advocated for new systems of categorization, including the Cyclone Damage Potential Index and the Integrated Kinetic Energy index. Both of these systems take into account factors other than wind speed -- the idea being that more variables make a scale more valuable.Boiling down a storm's complexity to a single number may be unrealistic, but there are surely ways to improve the current system. The Purdue team's work shows that central pressure deficit itself may achieve this goal, or at least do a better job than maximum wind speed alone."}

Their study was recently published in the open-access journal Often referred to as Central America's \"hidden gem\" for its abundance of undisturbed rainforests and natural beauty, Belize has a long-standing record for vigorously protecting and maintaining their forested areas. However, just as in any other developing country, its primary sector is expanding with agricultural land clearings becoming more frequent with newly established properties.Approximately midway through the study (June -- September 2016), the site was hit by Hurricane Earl, a Category 1 hurricane. The hurricane-force winds altered the canopy cover significantly over the forested study sites, due to felled trees and broken branches.Surprisingly enough, the herpetofauna remained relatively unchanged in the aftermath of Earl. The phenomenon revealed that not only were herpetofaunal communities lacking sensitivity to anthropogenic changes in the area, but also to extreme weather events, even though these had affected most of the standing vegetation.Some notable observations occurred within three days of Hurricane Earl, according to Russell Gray:\"One of the trapping system was catching arboreal [tree climbing] snake species, like the cat-eyed snake and blunt-headed tree snake. This wasn't only interesting because arboreal snakes were caught in terrestrial traps, but rather because they were never caught in our traps during the study up to this point.\"\"Even more interesting is that they were caught exclusively in the manicured orchard area, which makes me wonder if they somehow predicted falling trees and fled to the only habitat without them. Some animals appear to forecast weather events due to sudden or drastic changes in environmental conditions. I wonder if this is a similar case.\"Amongst other notable scientific discoveries reported during the project were two new accounts of the PetÃ©n Centipede Snake (Further noteworthy instances were two range extensions for relatively data deficient species -- one for the Doflein's Salamander (Besides providing important data on herpetofauna assemblages in various disturbed and undisturbed habitats in Belize, the research identifies future conservation methods to be considered.The study serves as new evidence that as long as agricultural areas remain surrounded with natural habitat buffers, they have little effect on herpetofaunal communities.Replicates of this study are encouraged by the authors and can be utilized as a feasible and efficient way to monitor reptiles and amphibians in Belize.Although Belize still preserves a considerable amount of intact forest cover, there are several on-going conservation concerns. Besides agricultural land clearings, there are constant struggles with xate poachers, or \"Xateros,\" on the Guatemalan border, as well as illegal logging activities and illegal off-season hunting.Unfortunately, reptiles and amphibians have been understudied in comparison to other vertebrates and government action is rarely enforced on their conservation throughout the Neotropics.A striking example of this relates to the only critically endangered reptile in Belize -- the Hickatee turtle (Dermatemys mawii). Although the species is likely to become extinct, it is still traditionally collected for its culinary value, while its hunting is banned only in May.In conclusion, the authors note that it is crucial to pay close attention to anthropogenic activity and the potential repercussions it may have on native species. With extensive and active efforts to study Mesoamerican herpetofauna, proper conservation efforts can be implemented and focused."}

This week a team of experts from Rice University, the University of Houston-Clear Lake, Texas A&M and Boston University will sail from Galveston on a five-day expedition to the reefs. They will work in collaboration with staff scientists from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Office of National Marine Sanctuaries to collect samples of water, microbes, sediment, corals and sponges to monitor the health of the reefs.\"The salinity at one buoy on the reef dropped from 36 to 32 on Sept. 28, but it rebounded to 36 by Oct. 4, and it has been between 35 and 36 since then,\" said Rice marine biologist Adrienne Correa, one of the expedition scientists. \"We don't yet know what impact the low salinity had on the reef while it was there.\"Expedition member and GERG scientist Kathryn Shamberger, a Texas A&M oceanographer who took measurements at the reef in late September, said the team is collaborating with scientists across Texas to track the plume of Harvey floodwater as it migrates through the Gulf.\"The Harvey freshwater had moved toward Corpus Christi and was northwest of the Flower Garden Banks when I was on the last cruise,\" Shamberger said. \"But that cruise ended Oct. 1 and things could be very different by now.\"Correa, Shamberger and Boston University biologist Sarah Davies, UH-Clear Lake biologist Lory Santiago-Vazquez and Texas A&M oceanographer Jason Sylvan expect to receive a one-year Rapid Research Response grant from the National Science Foundation to support their work at the Flower Garden Banks.

But even absent a direct hit, she said, there is risk through early November of eddies and steering currents bringing enough floodwater to the reefs to reduce salinity to unhealthy levels.\"When people look at the impact of hurricanes on coral reefs, they often look at physical damage or breakage of reef frameworks by waves and storm surge,\" Correa said. \"Much less is known about the impacts of freshwater influx from the precipitation associated with a hurricane.\""}

Under the warming oceans scenario, the intensity and size of the hurricane at the same risk level is likely to be much greater, and the expected loss figure climbs to $12 billion.The model drew on hurricane data for the last 150 years gathered by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, then created simulated hurricanes under the two scenarios over 100,000 years and estimated the damage from every storm that made landfall in the study area.Researchers then overlaid information from the Federal Emergency Management Agency's HAZUS database, a zip-code-by-zip-code inventory of building types and occupancy. HAZUS sets out loss estimates according to wind speed for costs of repair, replacement, content and inventory, as well as costs resulting from loss of use, such rental income loss, business interruption and daily production output loss.The researchers did not find that warming oceans will lead to more frequent hurricanes, only that warmer seas will lead to higher wind speeds and storms that are greater in size and therefore cover a larger area.The losses are calculated based only on wind and wind-driven rain and do not include the large financial impacts of storm surge or flooding.\"The study shows that a significant increase in damage and loss is likely to occur in coastal Carolina, and by implication other coastal communities, as a result of climate change,\" said one of the authors of the paper, David Rosowky, a civil engineer at the University of Vermont and the university's provost.\"To be prepared, we need to build, design, zone, renovate and retrofit structures in vulnerable communities to accommodate that future,\" he said.The study was based on the IPPC's Fifth Assessment, issued in 2013 and 2014. The worst-case ocean warming scenario the loss study is based on was not anticipated or included in the prior report, published in 2007.\"That suggests that these scenarios are evolving,\" Rosowsky said. \"What is today's worst case scenario will likely become more probable in the IPCC's future reports if little action is taken to slow the effects of climate change.\"The increasing severity of hurricanes will also affect hurricane modeling, Rosowsky said, and consequent predictions of damage and financial loss. In a postscript to the paper, which will also be published as a chapter in a forthcoming book, Rosowsky cites the three catastrophic storms of the current hurricane season, Harvey, Irma and Maria, as examples of events so severe they will shift the assumptions about the likelihood that such severe hurricanes will occur in the future."}

A treatment modality called Skills for Psychological Recovery (SPR) -- a skills-building intervention to reduce stress and improve coping among survivors -- was used in the effort.However, studies have shown that PTSD prevalence in New York state remained high approximately 1 to 1.5 years after the storm. Moreover, more than half of those with perceived need for mental health services did not received such services. Similar patterns were observed following a variety of disasters, such the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001.The authors argued that a potential reason for the persistence in mental health conditions, despite provision of usual care such as SPR, could be ascribed to the lack of effective triage to appropriate levels of care. Evidence suggests that a stepped care (SC) approach providing screening and triage is more effective and may provide greater reach for mental health care services. The approach has been recommended in the context of disasters but has not be tested on the field.The researchers used an agent-based model to simulate the stepped care approach for 2,642,713 agents using the sociodemographic characteristics derived from the American Community Survey estimates for New York City. Using an observational survey of residents of affected areas after Hurricane Sandy, the investigators estimated the initial distribution of the prevalence and exhibited PTSD symptoms to be 4.38 percent. They then simulated treatment scenarios starting four weeks following the landfall of Hurricane Sandy and ending two years later. Under the stepped care approach, individuals identified as PTSD cases were referred to cognitive behavioral therapists and non-cases were referred to SRP, while those receiving usual care were all referred to SRP.The study found that three to six months after the hurricane, stepped care delivered greater reach, treatment effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness than usual care when it came to hurricane-related PTSD. The authors cautioned that the SC model would still require substantial resources for deployment: $50.94 million to $101.87 million in the simulated scenario after Hurricane Sandy.In the absence of randomized trials, the authors wrote, the simulation results present the best evidence for establishing stepped care in the treatment of PTSD following large-scale disasters.\"These results provide further proof of concept for the SC approach to treating PTSD after a disaster, and they warrant further study and application in real-world settings,\" the authors wrote."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_151", "content": "The study, published by There are advantages and disadvantages to each technique, according to study co-authors Lace M. Padilla, Ian T. Ruginski and Sarah H. Creem-Regehr of the Department of Psychology at the University of Utah.\"Even though hurricane forecasts are costly and have a high impact on health and safety, there has been little research demonstrating how to depict forecast uncertainty to the general public effectively,\" said Padilla.In one experiment, the researchers showed participants either a summary display or an ensemble display with hurricane forecast data and asked them to interpret size and intensity of the storm on a hypothetical oil rig that was shown in different locations. Two additional experiments used only ensemble displays, showing oil rigs at different distances from the storm's center and either on or between forecast lines.Although the two types of displays used the same hurricane data, participants interpreted size and intensity differently. The researchers found summary displays were more likely to be misinterpreted than ensemble displays. The cone of uncertainty in a summary display, for example, depicts a hurricane's possible path, with no information about size, but study participants were likely to interpret the display as showing a storm growing in size and intensity.Ensemble displays are promising for high-level decisions such as regions to evacuate, but the researchers found that novice viewers' judgments are biased when their point of interest overlaps with a line in the ensemble. In the ensemble display experiment, participants were more likely to predict greater damage to an oil rig located on an ensemble line compared to one not falling on a line.This suggests that people may be more likely to evacuate or take precautionary actions if one of the lines in an ensemble overlaps with their own town, but feel relatively safe if not. This type of risk assessment is inaccurate because forecast scientists choose how many lines they want to show -- meaning that ensemble forecasts rarely show all the possible paths the hurricane could take.These findings matter because the visualization technique chosen can change what information people think is most important and affect decision making about mandatory evacuations and allocation of emergency management resources, the researchers said.\"There are pros and cons for each method of showing hurricane forecasts. That is why it is so important for the media to be informed about how the information they show can influence people's actions,\" said Padilla.The findings also have implications for media reports, since based on the type of images used, more context may be needed to help the public understand what they are seeing and what it means."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_152", "content": "As the last ice age waned, undersea landslide deposits called turbidites captured the fury of Florida's stormy days. Previously, Toomey linked turbidites in the Bahamas with modern hurricanes. For this study, the group examined turbidites in cores spanning the shift from the Younger Dryas into the warmer early Holocene, collected offshore the Dry Tortugas, Florida. The turbidites, complete with smashed up shells and jumbled sediments, reveal that in Younger Dryas days Florida was surprisingly hurricane-prone, at a time when cooler sea surface temperatures may have put the brakes on such intense storms elsewhere in the Atlantic.To explore why, Toomey and colleagues analyzed computer models that simulated ocean and atmospheric conditions near Florida during that period. In modern times, the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) brings cool water south and warm water north. But during the Younger Dryas the AMOC is thought to have weakened considerably, slowing circulation and reshaping environmental conditions across much of the Northern Hemisphere.Modeling results indicated that lower sea surface temperatures in the tropical Atlantic, near Barbados, for example, corresponded with a drop in storm potential intensity. Near Florida, sea surfaces cooled as well. However, the change there was not as dramatic as further south or to the north. The relative warmth of waters offshore the southeastern U.S. compared to the regional Atlantic, explains Toomey, seems to have set the stage for intense hurricanes near Florida. \"The modeling work suggests other factors, such as wind shear and humidity at mid-latitudes, outweighed changes in sea surface temperature at our core site,\" he says. Models and geologic records both show that by the early Holocene, as the AMOC regained strength, Florida's hurricanes subsided.The results, says Toomey, reveal that when it comes to generating hurricanes, ocean circulation plays a powerful role. What's more, he adds, the study demonstrates that on certain types of coastlines, turbidites have great potential for unraveling ancient hurricane histories. However, Toomey cautions against applying the results directly to future hurricane activity. He says for that, we need more field data and higher resolution models. \"That's where I see this work headed next.\""}

It was a record year for green turtle nesting along the refuge's beaches in southern Brevard County, but storm surge due to hurricane Irma destroyed many unhatched loggerhead and green turtle nests. University of Central Florida researchers estimate that of nests laid through the end of September, more than half of the season's green turtle nests and a quarter of loggerhead nests were lost.Both species are listed as threatened under the U.S. Endangered Species Act, and Florida hosts the majority of both species' U.S. nests. The section of the Archie Carr National Wildlife Refuge monitored by UCF hosts about a third of the Florida's green turtle nests.\"Last year with Hurricane Matthew, we lucked out because it was a low green turtle year,\" said Kate Mansfield, assistant professor and director of the UCF Marine Turtle Research Group, noting that green turtles typically have alternating high and low nesting years. \"This year was an extraordinarily exciting year for green turtle nesting, breaking all previous records within the refuge and continuing the conservation success story for the species. Unfortunately, we had another big hurricane this year, highlighting the need for continued conservation efforts in the area.\"Green turtles set a new record in 2017, laying 15,744 nests in the sands of the 13 miles of the Brevard County portion of the Archie Carr National Wildlife Refuge monitored by UCF. An estimated 8,830 of those were lost to the storm. Green turtles nest later in the season than other species, so many of their eggs hadn't hatched by the time Irma hit. Some 56 percent of total green nests were lost, an estimated 81 percent of those that were still incubating.Along the same stretch of beach, loggerheads laid 9,690 nests in 2017, but most had already hatched when Irma passed through the region. Still, an estimated 2,290 loggerhead nests were lost. That's 24 percent of the total loggerhead nests and 91 percent of those that were still incubating when hurricane-driven storm surge came ashore.The refuge is located at the northern extent of dense leatherback nesting in Florida, but the species nest in far fewer numbers, laying just 23 nests in 2017 within the portion of the refuge monitored by UCF. But they nest earlier than greens and loggerheads, and all of the leatherback nests had finished incubating before the hurricane.UCF also monitors another 16.4 miles of beaches north of the wildlife refuge, at Patrick Air Force Base and in central Brevard County. Considerably fewer nests are laid there than in the Archie Carr National Wildlife Refuge, but the numbers are still high compared to many other parts of the country. On those beaches, an estimated 642 of 2,251 green turtle nests and 831 of 6,229 loggerhead nests were lost due to the hurricane.The UCF Marine Turtle Research Group also found evidence that some green turtle hatchlings have emerged since the hurricane. And some turtles have continued to come ashore and lay new nests. Within the wildlife refuge, 466 new green turtle nests and eight new loggerhead nests were laid in September following Irma. Along the other UCF-monitored beaches, 72 new green nests and three new loggerhead nests were laid.Still, the nests aren't out of danger.\"Green turtles are still nesting, but recent extremely high tides have likely wiped out many of those new nests, too,\" said Erin Seney, an assistant research scientist with the UCF group. \"The good news is that the nesting habits of sea turtles do protect them from large-scale nest loss and make them more resilient to this kind of event. They lay multiple nests per nesting season, roughly every other year for 30 years or more.\"UCF researchers have run a sea turtle monitoring and research program on the beaches of the Archie Carr National Wildlife Refuge in southern Brevard County for 35 years. Their findings about sea turtle nesting activity are among the reasons the refuge was created in 1991. Last year, the university and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service signed a landmark agreement that formalized UCF's use of refuge facilities and established a protocol that will allow UCF to build research facilities and a plan that will give UCF oversight of the facilities for 40 years or more.UCF's portion of the Archie Carr National Wildlife Refuge (21 km) -- nest totals through Sept. 30Estimated Irma-related nest loss on UCF's portion of the Archie Carr National Wildlife RefugeUCF's \"other beaches\" (PAFB and Central Brevard -- combined 26.5 km) -- combined nest totals through Sept. 30Estimated Irma-related nest loss on PAFB+Central Brevard"}

Looking into this question can shed light on how societies are dealing with such extreme events and whether they are going to be able to adapt to changing conditions in the future.Professor Eleonora Rohland, author of the historical perspective, notes that although lessons may be learned in the aftermath of disasters, these may be disrupted by changing political regimes or migration of parts of the population, which are no longer willing to adapt.The range of possible actions to hurricanes is limited to evacuation, large-scale engineering projects such as floodgates and dams, loss prevention (insurance), and the self- organization of society in recovery and rebuilding in the aftermath of a hurricane disaster. In retracing the evolution of these adaptation options and their entanglement with the history of science and technology, the article reveals the contingency involved in the development of hurricane knowledge and science.\"The historical long-term perspective reveals that we are at a watershed moment in human history right now: adaptation -- to climate change or increasing/stronger extreme events such as hurricanes -- has turned from a contingent and drawn out historical process into an imperative, a prescriptive policy, almost,\" said Prof. Rohland. \"For current climate change adaptation research, it is worth looking into the historical record to take into account the cultural, societal, and political factors that hampered adaptation in the past in order to be prepared for the future."}

After Hurricane Harvey devastated the Texas coast, it became clear to GERG and Liquid Robotics that using an autonomous surface vehicle would be an efficient way to gather and report important real-time ocean data and understand the new impacts to the ecosystem.\"This research effort would not have happened without the support of Liquid Robotics,\" said Dr. Steve DiMarco, GERG\"We are honored to assist Texas A&M on this historic mission to help oceanographers understand how parts of the Gulf of Mexico ecosystem are impacted by Hurricane Harvey,\" added Mark Bindon, vice president of Mission Services at Liquid Robotics. \"It's a great example of how Wave Gliders are augmenting traditional oceanographic tools to help scientists gain real time insights to the changing conditions of the Gulf and its tributaries.\"The researchers deployed the \"We were tracking extremely low salinity values, very uncharacteristic for this time of year,\" DiMarco said.\"All of the freshwater that resulted from Hurricane Harvey is coming out of Galveston Bay, out of the Brazos, Trinity and Sabine rivers, and all of that flows out into the Gulf, then impacting the coastal environment,\" he added. Because such major in-flows are not typical in these parts of the Gulf from those watersheds, he said \"this much freshwater flowing out there could impact the coastal environment tremendously,\" potentially causing low-oxygen conditions and harmful algal blooms.For the next 60 days, the \"We are very pleased that we were able to respond so quickly to this event and with some of our new technology,\" said The research team is very concerned about the freshwater plume's potential negative impacts to the Flower Garden Banks.\"These are stunningly beautiful coral reefs that are just 100 miles south of Galveston,\" DiMarco said. \"So the fear is that if that plume makes it all the way out there, it could impact the health of the coral there. They are open-ocean corals that are used to high salinities; having so much freshwater come through could stress those corals and lead to bleaching and mortality.\"\"This could put the Flower Garden Banks in jeopardy,\" he said."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_156", "content": "\"Observers can be taken in by the post-apocalyptic image that some flood-damaged neighborhoods present over a decade after Katrina. It stimulates the imagination. But local people see it as a failure of public policy and a social problem,\" said lead author Joshua Lewis, a research professor at the ByWater Institute at Tulane University and the Stockholm Resilience Centre at Stockholm University. \"For a community that has had thousands of people come back and struggle to rebuild, to reopen schools and churches, it's frustrating to see their neighborhoods portrayed as disintegrating or losing ground to nature.\"In a study of plant life across New Orleans post-Hurricane Katrina, the researchers were surprised to find that demographic factors of wealth, race, housing recovery, and land abandonment were better predictors of vegetation patterns than the degree of intensity of flooding and wind during the 2005 storm.\"A whole range of neighborhoods and demographics were hit by Katrina. They don't all have equal access to private capital and ability to navigate housing recovery programs, and that is what we see driving the type of vegetation emerging on these abandoned properties,\" said Lewis.In the wake of Katrina, many of New Orleans' damaged properties were never rebuilt. Though city and state agencies maintain some abandoned lots as close-clipped lawns, other lots have grown thickets of mostly non-native, opportunistic, or invasive species. The ecological utility of these unplanned green spaces has been noted. Cooling green canopies absorb stormwater and succor songbirds, for example.But abandoned land may also provide habitat for rats and mosquitoes, and the diseases they carry. These urban jungles can become dumping grounds for junk, harbor invasive species, and present a safety risk, especially for women. The social stigma of unmanaged \"green blight\" can depress redevelopment and thwart efforts to raise neighborhood prosperity and attract investment.\"New Orleans is a pretty heavily forested city, but the parks and managed green space aren't evenly distributed. The neighborhoods we're talking about had relatively low forest cover before Katrina. In hurricane-hit neighborhoods, we now have green space, but it's space that causes more problems than benefits for the people who live there,\" Lewis said.Lewis and colleagues examined eight neighborhoods, representing a cross-section of demographics and flooding severity, to learn how the current plant life of post-Katrina New Orleans reflects the flooding during the hurricane and post-disaster management. They looked at the age and size of trees and other plants, recording the composition of species at sample sites, conducting interviews, and developing a social database from census data and other metrics. From this data, they assessed the influence of the city's physical and social geography on regrowth.Neighborhoods with unmanaged growth do not necessarily have more trees, Lewis said, but they do have a lot of opportunistic and invasive trees and shrubs. The authors noted a striking contrast between the unmanaged plant pioneers dominating lots in the Lower 9\"Some municipalities have figured out ways to maintain these lots, regardless of who owns them,\" said Lewis, noting that neighborhoods may have different mindsets around government intervention, and political tensions over land management are perennial.Lewis believes there are ways to transition some neglected lots into stormwater parks, utilizing them for green infrastructure interventions. But accomplishing that will require better knowledge of New Orleans' specific conditions, political will, and buy-in from skeptical residents who have seen past promises for green infrastructure projects unfulfilled, or worse, seen as an attempt at displacement of residents or neighborhood gentrification. . He also had a cautionary note for scientists conducting research in in cities that have endured environmental tragedies.\"Going in with the idea that the hurricane has created a clean slate for ecology -- in an urban setting, that is not the way to approach your research. Urban ecosystems are embedded in sociopolitical dynamics that shape the current conditions, and will continue to do so going forward,\" he said.Once emergent forests are established, mitigation requires cutting everything and replanting with native hardwoods and other native vegetation. Investments are being made, but biologists are several years away from figuring out how to make interventions that are affordable and easily maintained, Lewis said.\"Management and maintenance is the key problem. That's what we need to sort out here in New Orleans,\" Lewis said."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_157", "content": "The research by hydrologists and land-use experts at Rice University and Texas A&M University at Galveston was published in the journal \"The takeaway from this study, which was borne out in Harvey, is that many losses occur in areas outside FEMA's 100-year flood plain,\" said study co-author Antonia Sebastian, a research associate at Rice's Severe Storm Prediction, Education and Evacuation from Disasters (SSPEED) Center and a postdoctoral researcher at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands.\"What we've tried to show, both with this study and several others, is that it is possible to do better,\" said lead author Russell Blessing, a Texas A&M-Galveston graduate student with joint appointments at the SSPEED Center and Texas A&M-Galveston's Center for Texas Beaches and Shores. \"There are innovative computational and hydrological tools available to build more predictive maps.\"In the new study, Blessing, Sebastian and co-author Sam Brody, a professor of marine sciences at Texas A&M-Galveston, director of the Center for Texas Beaches and Shores and a SSPEED Center investigator, examined the Armand Bayou watershed in southeast Harris County. Armand Bayou's 60-square-mile watershed includes portions of Houston, Pasadena, Deer Park, La Porte and Taylor Lake Village, as well as unincorporated portions of Harris County.Five major rain events occurred in the study area between 1999-2009. They were Hurricane Ike (2008), Tropical Storms Erin (2007) and Allison (2001, and two rainstorms that caused flooding in 2006 and 2009.Hydrologists often characterize rain events and flooding events with a statistic known as \"return interval.\" A 100-year flood has a 100-year return interval, but Blessing said that does not mean such a storm is only expected to occur every 100 years. Rather, it means there is a 1-in-100 chance, or a 1 percent chance, that the event will occur in any given year. Thus, a 50-year event would have a 2 percent chance of occurring each year, a 10-year event would have a 10 percent chance, and so on.Brody said one problem with FEMA's 100-year flood plain maps is that they assume that flooding will only take place in one dimension, that is, either downstream or upstream, and not perpendicular to the channel.\"That assumption doesn't hold when you're in really low-lying areas, like Armand Bayou or other coastal watersheds that are very flat,\" he said. \"When flooding rain accumulates in these areas, it can flow in just about any direction depending upon how high it gets.\"Another issue with FEMA's maps is their lack of granularity. Brody and Blessing said the type of soil (such as clay versus sand) and the way land is used (such as a concrete parking lot or a school playground) have significant impacts on flooding, and FEMA's models often use a single classification for entire neighborhoods or groups of neighborhoods. In so doing, they miss out on small-scale features that can significantly affect flooding.Sebastian said focusing on 100-year events is also problematic because short, intense rainfall events that don't meet the 100-year threshold can still cause serious flooding.\"In Armand Bayou, a 100-year rainfall event is one that drops 13.5 inches of rain in a 24-hour period,\" she said. \"In reality, we also experience much more intense rainfalls in less time. So, for example, when it rains 6 inches in two or three hours, it can also cause serious flooding.\"In several other studies, including a number that examined flooding in the Clear Creek watershed, Blessing, Brody, Sebastian and SSPEED colleagues have shown that other approaches, like distributed hydrologic modeling and probabilistic flood plain mapping, can be far more predictive of flood damages and flood risk."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_158", "content": "But the relationship between exposure to extreme weather and support for climate policies is small, the study finds. And it fades quickly; a month after an extreme weather event, there was no effect.\"People respond to recent weather, whether it's temperature spikes, severe storms or other events,\" said David Konisky, an associate professor in the School of Public and Environmental Affairs and an author of the study. \"But the effects are small. Extreme weather is much less significant than other factors when it comes to attitudes about climate.\"A warming climate is increasing the frequency and severity of extreme weather events, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. It seems to follow that experiencing extreme weather would make people more supportive of policies to adapt to climate change. The study suggests that may happen, but only for the short term and not to the extent that may have been expected.Konisky said the effect of experiencing extreme weather pales next to other factors that influence attitudes toward climate policies, such as one's political beliefs and party affiliation.\"People are pretty certain of where they stand on climate change, and extreme weather does not really move the needle much,\" he said.The researchers examined survey responses from the Cooperative Congressional Election Study and correlated them with data from the National Weather Service's Storm Events Database. They focused on three policies for climate adaptation: restrictions on coastal development, limits on outdoor residential water use and regulation of stormwater runoff from residential property.All three policies enjoyed considerable support, but respondents who had experienced recent extreme weather expressed only modestly stronger support than other respondents.The researchers also looked for correlations between extreme weather events and support for policies to adapt to those particular events -- for example, coastal flooding and restrictions on coastal development. There too, they found only modest correlations.The study included a wide variety of severe weather events, Konisky said, and its findings may not entirely apply to headline-grabbing events like the Texas flooding caused by Hurricane Harvey or the threat to Florida by Hurricane Irma. But it suggests that even catastrophic weather may not change attitudes as much as many people expect."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_159", "content": "\"As hurricane Harvey approached the U.S., hurricane hunters flew directly into the storm and dropped sensors to measure wind speed,\" said Xiankang Dou, leader of the research team at the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC). \"Our Doppler LIDAR instrument can be used from a plane to remotely measure a hurricane's wind with high spatial and temporal resolutions. In the future, it could even make these measurements from aboard satellites.\"Wind measurements are also crucial for determining safe flying conditions, understanding how pollution moves through the air and efficiently operating wind turbines. Existing high-accuracy wind measurement technologies can be expensive and difficult to operate, leading to gaps in the application of these technologies in situations where they are most useful.\"We demonstrated a Doppler wind LIDAR with a simplified optical layout that also substantially enhances the system stability,\" said Dou. \"Although specialists are typically needed to operate and maintain a sophisticated Doppler LIDAR, we are confident we can develop our approach into a system that will be as easy to use as a smartphone.\"In The Optical Society (OSA) journal One important application of LIDAR is in aeronautics, where it can be used on aircrafts or from a ground station to remotely measure air motion. With a vertical spatial resolution of 10 meters, the new system could measure small-scale wind phenomena such as wind shear and the wake turbulence created by an aircraft. A better understanding of these phenomena could improve flight safety and also increase airport capacity by optimizing the separation between aircraft during takeoff and landing.LIDAR is a remote sensing method that has been used to create high-resolution maps, scan the bottom of the ocean floor and to guide driverless cars. For measuring wind, a LIDAR system emits a laser pulse that propagates through the atmosphere where it interacts with molecules and aerosols. A small amount of the light scatters back towards the LIDAR instrument, where it is collected by a telescope. When wind causes air to move, this causes a Doppler shift that can be detected by the device.The researchers designed a dual frequency direct detection Doppler wind LIDAR that used a laser emitting 1.5-micron light. Because this wavelength is commonly used in optical communications networks, they were able to build the system using commercially available fiber-optic components, each combining several light-controlling components into a single device. The all fiber construction of the LiDAR system is therefore robust against vibrations and rough operation handling.Compared to previously developed systems, the new simplified design makes it much easier to configure and align each component, increases stability and lowers the amount of light lost within the system. The new system also requires no calibration after it is initialized and requires no special eye protection.\"For LIDAR systems that will be operated full-time in the field, eye safety is an important consideration,\" said Haiyun Xia, the principle investigator of the Quantum Lidar Laboratory at USTC. \"Fortunately, the 1.5-micron laser we used exhibits the highest permissible exposure for eye safety in the wavelength range from 0.3 to 10 microns.\"The 1.5-micron wavelength is also ideal for atmospheric wind sensing from satellites because, compared to UV and visible wavelengths, it shows less susceptibility to atmospheric disturbance and optical contamination from the sun and other sources. Satellite-based wind measurements are used for weather forecasts and meteorological studies. \"Space-borne Doppler wind LIDAR is now regarded as the most promising way to meet the need for global wind data requirements and to fill gaps in the wind data provided by other methods,\" said Xia.The optical setup for the new Doppler wind LIDAR contains just one laser source, one detector and a single-channel Fabry-Perot interferometer that converts the Doppler shift into photon number variations of the backscatter signals. Using a Fabry-Perot interferometer made of optical fibers rather than one consisting of many individual optical components made the system robust and stable enough to use in harsh environments such as aboard aircraft or satellites.The new system also includes one of the fastest detectors available for single photon counting, a superconducting nanowire single photon detector (SNSPD). This detector improved the LIDAR's performance compared to the InGaAs avalanche photodiodes typically used to detect 1.5-micron light.\"The high detection efficiency and low dark count rate of the SNSPD means that the weak signal from the backscattered light can be detected with a high signal-to-noise ratio,\" said Xia. \"Another attractive feature of the SNSPD is its high maximum count rate, which helps avoid detector saturation.\"The researchers tested their system by first examining its stability after calibration. Overall, the system's measurements varied by less than 0.2 meters per second over 10 days in the lab. They then tested the system outdoors and compared its horizontal wind measurements with measurements from an ultrasonic wind sensor, a non-remote system for measuring wind. On average, the LIDAR measurements were within 0.1 meters per second and 1 degrees for wind speed and direction, respectively.The researchers are now working to improve the spatial resolution of the Doppler wind LIDAR system and want to make it even more practical to use in the field. They have also founded a company to further develop the system and plan to have a commercial version available next year."}

Irradiation has been used worldwide to save documents such as ancient Orthodox Christian icons in Romania, cultural artifacts in Brazil and religious sculptures in France.The same technology could be used on items damaged by Hurricane Harvey flood waters, such as passports, birth, marriage or death certificates, and books, Pillai said.\"In the case where a library has been destroyed, all of the books -- especially those that are out of print or rare -- may not have to be thrown away,\" he said.He said the method has been shown by other researchers around the world that it does not harm the document if the appropriate dose is delivered.\"The technology uses electrons from commercial electricity, which are accelerated to break the DNA of the fungal spores and bacterial cells. That destroys the pathogen but not the material,\" Pillai explained.The electron beam center normally works with foods to keep them safe for human and animal consumption.

But the center has worked on documents in the past.\"An army base in Texas had some maps that were water damaged, and so we worked to help save them,\" Pillai recalled.The key is an optimal dose to destroy the possible pathogens from sewage-contaminated flood waters but not the material, he said, but there is no single \"recipe\" to use for all documents.That's where the research part of the center is vital.

(Though, there was some evidence of a tightening overall credit market for flooded residents.)In addition, two broad measures of financial health -- debt delinquency rates and credit scores -- showed short-lived and modest increases: The worst-flooded residents had 90-day delinquency rates that were about 10 percent higher, relative to non-flooded residents, for the three months following Katrina."}

Whether they decide to leave room for marshes to move inland or instead build seawalls that harden shorelines means the difference between saving tidal wetlands and their many ecological, economic, and recreational benefits, or losing them altogether.While surveyed landowners whose properties flooded during the hurricane were 1.4 times more likely to say they may be willing to sell their vulnerable land outright, the real world results call those stated intentions into question. Federal buyout programs after both hurricanes acquired fewer than 100 properties in the study area, although many more were eligible, the study states.If land protection agreements with nonprofits and government agencies aren't the answer, what offers greater promise for the future of marshes?Surveyed landowners responded favorably to the idea of restrictive covenants, even though they typically do not include financial incentives. Under restrictive covenants, an entire neighborhood agrees to forgo building seawalls and other shoreline armoring structures. However, note the researchers, these strategies tend to be counterproductive in the long run, because they divert erosion and flooding to adjoining properties.Coastal landowners also liked the notion of future interest agreements. Under these programs, private landowners agree to accept the fair market value of their property at the time of signing if future flooding reduces the value by more than half. That future flooding would mean dry upland has been allowed to turn into coastal marsh.The study was funded by Connecticut Sea Grant, UConn, and the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection.

And that's what we're facing in many locations as the climate continues to change.\"Ian Turner, director of WRL and a co-author, said sea level rise was no longer the only factor at play when preparing for the impact of climate change on waterfront areas. \"Shifts in storm patterns and wave direction will also have major consequences, because they distort and amplify the natural variability of coastal patterns.\"The study relied on data collected during the June 2016 'superstorm' that battered eastern Australia, one of the fiercest in decades; it inundated towns, smashed buildings, swept away cars and infrastructure and triggered hundreds of evacuations across a 3,000 km swathe from Queensland in the north all the way to Tasmania in the south. Three people died and there were more than 80 rescues from stranded cars.A week before the storm hit, and for many weeks afterwards, the researchers used a fleet of drones, floating sensor buoys, aircraft fitted with LiDAR laser ranging sensors, fixed cameras on buildings and quadbikes and jetskis fitted with real-time satellite positioning across a 200 km swathe of the eastern seaboard. This produced the largest and most detailed pre- and post-storm coastline analysis ever done.They found that 11.5 million cubic metres of sand was eroded from beaches across a 200 km stretch of Australia's eastern seaboard in just the three days of the storm -- the equivalent to filling the Melbourne Cricket Ground (capacity 100,000 people) to the brim with sand more than seven times.This was similar to the amount of sand shifted on the U.S. east coast by Hurricane Sandy in 2012, the largest Atlantic hurricane on record, which killed 233 people and caused US$75 billion in damage.It is the damaging power of wave energy -- and the disruption of long-established storm patterns due to climate change -- that present a new danger. The June 2016 'superstorm' that devastated Australia's east coast was only moderately intense, equivalent to a 1-in-5 year event: however, it did hit from the highly unusual easterly direction.\"And that's what's really worrying,\" said Turner. \"The damage we saw from a moderately intense storm last year is a harbinger of what's to come,\" said Turner. \"Climate change is not only raising the oceans and threatening foreshores, but making our coastlines much more vulnerable as the direction of incoming storms change.\"We need to be prepared,\" he added. \"Not just for the fact that what we consider as 'king tides' will be the norm within decades, but that the storms that strike the coast will come from unexpected directions, damaging coastal areas and infrastructure once thought safe from storm damage.\"Previous studies have estimated that sea level rise from climate change -- of between 40 cm and 1 metre over the next century -- could put $226 billion of infrastructure at risk in Australia alone. This includes road and rail, commercial and residential buildings and even light industrial buildings. But also threatened are 75 hospitals and health centres, 258 police, fire and ambulance stations, five power stations and 41 waste disposal facilities.\"When it comes to severe weather, a lot of the attention is paid to tropical storms like cyclones and hurricanes,\" said Harley. \"But this data highlights the amount of coastal damage that can occur with east-coast lows in Australia. Despite creating near hurricane-force winds, intense rain and large ocean waves of up to 9 meters, they are less worrisome to many people.\"Narrabeen Beach in Sydney experienced the most erosion seen in 40 years of monitoring -- and 36% greater than the second-most erosive event in May 1997. But it was not the worst affected: \"Although a swimming pool at Narrabeen became the iconic image of the June 2016 storm, the greatest erosion was actually seen at Nine Mile Beach, an unpopulated area just north of Forster,\" added Harley. \"And that was due to a localised focusing of wave energy.\"Coupled with a vast bank of data collected over the past 40 years at Narrabeen-Collaroy beaches -- one of the world's longest-running beach erosion monitoring programs -- coastal engineers now have enough information to build models that can accurately predict the damage storms would do days before an event.It would also provide a crucial insight into how climate change will interact with the long cycles of El NiÃ±o and La NiÃ±a, and predict coastal vulnerability from sea level rise and changing storm patterns in the decades ahead, said senior lecturer Kristen Splinter, an engineer and modelling specialist at WRL who deep-dives into the data to build predictive tools.And not just for Australia, but for the world. \"With this data, we can now construct accurate coastal erosion models, to predict damage days before a storm hits,\" said Splinter. \"It will also be pivotal in understanding the future effect of climate change on coastal variability around the world.\"Turner agreed: \"This isn't just about protecting beaches: billions of dollars' worth of city infrastructure around the world is threatened by coastal erosion: buildings, roads, power and water utility corridors, sewerage lines -- and this will only worsen as sea levels rise, causing storm tides to do more damage and reach deeper inland.\""}

He is also a member of UCF's Sustainable Coastal Systems Cluster.The study was conducted to make data about extreme events a part of the ongoing research and planning required to help communities prepare now for conditions that may be dramatically different in the not-too-distant future.Extreme sea levels are typically caused by a combination of high tides, storm surges, and in many cases waves, Wahl said.When an extreme event collides with continually rising seas, it takes a less intense storm, such as a Category I hurricane, to inflict as much coastal damage as a Category II or III storm would have had when the seas were lower.Because of the rising sea levels, which research has confirmed has occurred steadily during the past century and is expected to accelerate in the future, extreme events that are now expected to happen, on average, only once every hundred years, could occur every decade or even every year, in many places by 2050, the study said.Using a representative sample of 20 different methods for predicting extreme sea levels the researchers focused intensely on the measures of uncertainty that accompany any prediction, but that are particularly vexing in the analysis of extremes.Interspersing sea level rise with the latest predictions of extreme sea level events, the research team was able to illustrate the dramatic effect one has on the other and pinpoint regions of the world that are especially threatened.\"In order to understand coastal impacts under current and future climate and socio-economic conditions, we do not only need robust projections of mean sea level rise but also a profound knowledge of present-day and future extreme sea levels, because these events drive the impacts,\" Wahl said.The researcher team agreed that including extreme sea levels into coastal impact studies is imperative in helping vulnerable parts of the world effectively protect themselves by adapting through new or upgraded infrastructure such as dikes, pumping systems, barriers, or other tools like new building codes or flood zoning that prevents new infrastructure from being built in high-risk areas.\"Based on our results we can see, for the first time globally, what role uncertainties in extreme sea level predictions play,\" said study co-author and associate professor Ivan Haigh of the University of Southampton, UK. \"It helps identify hotspots where we can focus on in more detail, performing localized studies to reduce the uncertainties and improve our confidence in the results.\""}

In the Department of Meteorology at Stockholm University (MISU), researchers have done a series of model simulations investigating tropical cyclone activity during an earlier warm climate, the mid-Holocene, 6,000 years ago. The now hyper-arid Sahara desert was characterized by a lush extent of grass and consequently reduced dust emission due to changes in Earth's orbital parameters. Such changes in the orbital forcing led to much stronger summer insolation in the Northern Hemisphere and consequently to stronger monsoons.Earlier studies on the sensitivity of tropical cyclones to past climates have only analyzed the effect of changes in the solar radiation from orbital forcing on the formation of tropical cyclones, without considering the feedbacks associated to the consequent greening of the Sahara.\"Our results show that a greening of the Sahara with reduced dust loadings lead to more favorable conditions for tropical cyclone development,\" says Francesco S.R. Pausata, researcher at the Department of Meteorology, Stockholm University.The greening of Sahara strengthens the West African Monsoon, which triggers a change in the atmospheric circulation over the entire tropics, affecting tropical cyclone activity.\"It is of paramount importance to account for changes in Saharan vegetation and dust emissions when simulating past climate change. Therefore, also changes in land cover should be represented in climate models for projections of future climate,\" concludes Francesco S.R.

The country's first utility-scale offshore wind farm, consisting of five turbines, began commercial operation in December 2016 off the coast of Rhode Island.Turbine design standards are governed by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). For offshore turbines, no specific guidelines for hurricane-force winds exist. Offshore turbines can be built larger than land-based turbines, however, owing to a manufacturer's ability to transport larger molded components such as blades via freighter rather than over land by rail or truck.For the study, CU Boulder researchers set out to test the limits of the existing design standard. Due to a lack of observational data across the height of a wind turbine, they instead used large-eddy simulations to create a powerful hurricane with a computer.\"We wanted to understand the worst-case scenario for offshore wind turbines, and for hurricanes, that's a Category 5,\" said Rochelle Worsnop, a graduate researcher in CU Boulder's Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences (ATOC) and lead author of the study.These uniquely high-resolution simulations showed that under Category 5 conditions, mean wind speeds near the storm's eyewall reached 90 meters-per-second, well in excess of the 50 meters-per-second threshold set by current standards.\"Wind speeds of this magnitude have been observed in hurricanes before, but in only a few cases, and these observations are often questioned because of the hazardous conditions and limitations of instruments,\" said George Bryan of NCAR and a co-author of the study. \"By using large-eddy simulations, we are able to show how such winds can develop and where they occur within hurricanes.\"Furthermore, current standards do not account for veer, a measure of the change in wind direction across a vertical span. In the simulation, wind direction changed by as much as 55 degrees between the tip of the rotor and its hub, creating a potentially dangerous strain on the blade.The findings could be used to help wind farm developers improve design standards as well as to help stakeholders make informed decisions about the costs, benefits and risks of placing turbines in hurricane-prone areas.\"The study will help inform design choices before offshore wind energy development ramps up in hurricane-prone regions,\" said Worsnop, who received funding from the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program to conduct this research. \"We hope that this research will aid wind turbine manufacturers and developers in successfully tapping into the incredibly powerful wind resource just beyond our coastlines.\"\"Success could mean either building turbines that can survive these extreme conditions, or by understanding the overall risk so that risks can be mitigated, perhaps with financial instruments like insurance,\" said Professor Julie Lundquist of ATOC and CU Boulder's Renewable and Sustainable Energy Institute (RASEI), a co-author of the study. \"The next stage of this work would be to assess how often these extreme winds would impact an offshore wind farm on the Atlantic coast over the 20-to-30-year lifetime of a typical wind farm.\"The findings were recently published online in the journal"}

The season ended 318 days later in late November when Otto made landfall over southern Central America. Otto was record-breaking in location and intensity being a high-end Category 2 storm.In October, Hurricane Matthew became a Category 5 at the southernmost latitude on record for the North Atlantic Ocean. It was the first Category 5 in almost a decade and ended the longest stretch without one since 1950. Matthew claimed more than 600 lives, mainly in Haiti, and caused $15 billion in damage.Up until that point, conditions had been extremely dry.

The waves, known as atmospheric gravity waves, are produced by strong thunderstorms near the eye and radiate outward in expanding spirals.\"These very subtle waves can sometimes be seen in satellite images,\" said David Nolan, professor in the Department of Atmospheric Sciences, and lead author of the study. \"We were able to measure them in aircraft data and surface instruments.\"In addition, says Nolan, computer simulations performed at the UM Center for Computational Science can reproduce the waves, showing that the wave strengths can be related to the maximum wind speed in the core of the storm. These findings suggest that hurricanes and typhoons could be monitored from hundreds of miles away with relatively inexpensive instruments, such as barometers and anemometers, much like earthquakes from around the world are monitored by seismometers.The researchers analyzed data obtained from 25 different penetrations by NOAA P3 aircraft into five hurricanes in 2003 and 2004, as well as data from the Extreme Air-Sea Interaction (EASI) buoy deployed in the Pacific Ocean by UM Rosenstiel School scientists in 2010.\"The waves cause very weak upward and downward motions, which are recorded by the NOAA P3 as it flies through the storm,\" said Jun Zhang of the Hurricane Research Division, a veteran of many hurricane flights. \"But we were surprised at how clearly the waves could be detected at the surface.\"\"Of course, hurricanes are very well observed by satellites.

They migrate southward and eastward across the Caribbean through summer and early fall, before skirting the northern coast of South America and arriving at their winter habitat off the Atlantic coast of Brazil in November.Huang and his colleagues charted the migratory path by recording and mapping the dates and locations of all sooty terns banded for study at the Dry Tortugas since the 1950s but found dead elsewhere. They also mapped locational data retrieved from birds that were fitted with satellite-telemetry tracking tags. When they overlaid all this data with maps of hurricane paths from the same period, they discovered a striking correlation.\"While it's impossible to say just how many of the birds died as a direct result of the hurricanes, we saw a strong relationship between the numbers and locations of bird deaths and the numbers and locations of hurricanes,\" said Stuart L. Pimm, the Doris Duke Professor of Conservation Ecology at Duke's Nicholas School.\"What's really interesting is that it's not just the big category 4 and 5 storms that can kill large numbers of birds. A series of smaller, weaker storms may have the same impact as that of a single large, strong storm,\" Pimm noted. \"In September 1973, Tropical Storm Delia, a small storm in the Gulf of Mexico, killed a lot of birds because they were in the wrong place at the wrong time.\"Although sooty terns are neither rare nor endangered -- 80,000 or more of them are estimated to breed in the Dry Tortugas each year -- they have long been used by scientists as an indicator species to determine the health of the region's marine environment.\"If there are changes taking place in the ocean, you'll see corresponding changes taking place in the health of these tern populations, among other indicator species,\" Huang said. \"That's what makes our findings somewhat concerning.

No previous studies model how migration caused by sea-level rise will affect population other than in the directly affected coastal areas.Relationships between environmental stressors and migration are highly complex, as responses range from short-term, temporary migration to permanent, long-distance migration. Sea-level rise is a unique environmental stressor because it permanently converts habitable land to uninhabitable water.The new study combines estimates of populations at risk from sea-level rise within a migrations systems simulation to estimate both the number and destinations of potential sea-level rise migrations in the U.S. over the coming century.\"Some of the anticipated landlocked destinations, such as Las Vegas, Atlanta and Riverside, California, already struggle with water management or growth management challenges,\" Hauer said. \"Incorporating accommodation strategies in strategic long-range planning could help alleviate the potential future intensification of these challenges.\""}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_172", "content": "In a study conducted in the region two years prior to when Matthew's trekked across the Caribbean Sea, the research team in the Upper Ocean Dynamics Laboratory at the University of Miami (UM) Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science deployed 55 aircraft ocean instruments from the National Oceanographic Atmospheric Administration's WP-3D aircraft. The purpose of the scientific mission was to measure ocean temperature, salinity, and currents to understand the structure of these warm-water eddies.The science team obtained vital information about the physical characteristics within one large warm-water eddy, which likely originated from the North Brazil Current, and analyzed its potential influence on sub-surface ocean conditions during the passage of tropical cyclones.When analyzing the data, they found a barrier layer, an upper ocean feature created by the Amazon-Orinoco freshwater river outflow, that makes mixing in the upper ocean waters less efficient during wind events. This feature, and the fact that warm ocean eddies are known to assist in the intensification of hurricanes due to deep warm thermal layers, lead the researchers to theorize that the barrier layer within a warm ocean eddy may result in an even more favorable upper ocean environment for hurricane intensification.\"Our study is important because tropical cyclone intensity forecasts for several past hurricanes over the Caribbean Sea have under-predicted rapid intensification events over warm oceanic features,\" said Johna Rudzin, a PhD student at the UM Rosenstiel School and lead author of the study.Tropical storms receive energy from their surrounding ocean waters. As a storm moves across the water, it may interact with rings of warm water known as eddies. As the storm moves forward over these eddies, the warm ocean waters below help fuel the storm's intensity through enhanced and sustained heat and moisture fluxes.Similar warm ocean eddies exist in the Gulf of Mexico, a result of their separation from the warm-water Loop Current, are also of interest to the research team involved in this study.Last year, Hurricane Matthew rapidly intensified from a tropical storm to hurricane status as it moved over the Caribbean Sea in the location where a warm ocean eddy exists, and in close proximity to where these measurements were taken for this study two years prior. Matthew continued to intensify to a category-5 storm and into one of the strongest in Atlantic basin history, which made landfall and devastated portions of Haiti, Cuba, and the eastern United States.According to the researchers, to better understand if Matthew's intensification was aided by the warm-water eddies and the residing barrier layer in the Caribbean Sea's upper ocean, more ambient and in-storm upper ocean observations in this basin are needed to improve forecast models for the region."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_173", "content": "Using decades of global climate data generated at a spatial resolution of about 25 kilometers squared, researchers were able to capture the formation of tropical cyclones, also referred to as hurricanes and typhoons, and the extreme waves that they generate. Those same models, when run at resolutions of about 100 kilometers, missed the tropical cyclones and the big waves up to 30 meters high.Their findings, published in the Feb. 16 issue of \"It's well known that to study tropical cyclones using simulations, the models need to be run at high resolution,\" said study lead author and postdoctoral fellow Ben Timmermans. \"The majority of existing models used to study the global climate are run at resolutions that are insufficient to predict tropical cyclones. The simulations in our study are the first long-duration global data sets to use a resolution of 25 kilometers. It's also the first time a study has specifically examined the impact of resolution increase for ocean waves at a global climatological scale.\"The other authors on this study are DÃ¡ith? Stone, Michael Wehner, and Harinarayan Krishnan. All authors are scientists in Berkeley Lab's Computational Research Division (CRD).Climate models work by simulating the exchange of air, water, and energy between the grid \"boxes.\" In today's state-of-the-art climate models, these boxes are typically 100 to 200 kilometers wide. That level of detail is good enough to catch the formation and movement of midlatitude storms, the researchers said, because such systems tend to be quite large.In contrast, tropical cyclones tend to cover a smaller area. While the overall footprint of a hurricane can be broad, the eye of a hurricane can be very compact and well defined, the researchers noted.\"The problem with that 100-kilometer resolution is that it misses key details of the hurricanes and tropical cyclones, which are clearly relevant to the generation of extreme waves,\" said Stone. \"But going to a 25-kilometer resolution data set is computationally challenging. It requires 64 times more computational resources than a 100-kilometer simulation.\"The study relied upon the data-crunching power of the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC), a scientific computing user facility funded by the DOE Office of Science and based at Berkeley Lab.The researchers ran the Community Atmosphere Model version 5 (CAM5) climate model with data collected in three-hour increments at a low resolution of 100 kilometers and at a high resolution of 25?kilometers. They found that the high-resolution simulations included tropical cyclones where the low-resolution ones did not.To see if the cyclones had an effect on waves, they then ran global wave models at both resolutions. They saw extreme waves in the high-resolution model that did not appear in the low-resolution ones.\"Hurricanes are tricky things to model,\" said Stone. \"We've shown the importance of using a high-resolution data set for producing hurricanes. But the characteristics of hurricanes could change with the climate. People are making projections of changes in ocean waves in a future, warmer world. It's not clear if the 25-kilometer resolution is sufficient for capturing all of the processes involved in the development of a hurricane. But we do know that it's better than 100 kilometers.\"While additional high-resolution simulations of the future are on the way, the researchers were able to take a first look at possible conditions at the end of the 21st century. Wehner noted that the biggest waves in Hawaii are projected to be substantially larger in a much warmer future world.The researchers added that this study only looked at averages of wind-generated waves. One-off \"rogue\" or \"freak\" waves cannot be reproduced in these kinds of models, and large waves such as tsunamis are very different since they are caused by seismological activity, not the wind.The data from this study will be made freely available for use by the wider scientific community.\"In the same way that weather patterns are part of the climate, ocean wave patterns are also part of the 'wave' climate,\" said Timmermans. \"Ocean waves are relevant to the interaction between the ocean and the atmosphere, which affects the planet's climate as a whole.\""}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_174", "content": "In fact, the research -- published Wednesday [Jan. 4, 2017] in the journal The relationship between the number of hurricanes that develop in the Atlantic basin and the number of major hurricanes that make landfall is a weak one, says Kossin, and one that has not yet been well explained. The new study accounts for at least part of that relationship.Historically, notes Kossin, researchers (including himself) have focused primarily on the tropical Atlantic -- the main hurricane development region -- without distinguishing how hurricane-producing conditions may vary outside of it.They knew a combination of warm ocean temperatures in the tropics and low vertical wind shear (changes in wind speed relative to altitude) results in favorable conditions for hurricane formation, while cooler than average sea surface temperatures work in tandem with higher than average wind shears to produce quieter hurricane seasons.Scientists also knew that environmental conditions, primarily ocean temperatures and wind shear, determine whether Atlantic hurricanes intensify or weaken as their natural track pushes them northwesterly toward the U.S. coast.But Kossin, a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration National Centers for Environmental Information scientist working out of UW-Madison's NOAA Cooperative Institute, wondered \"what other patterns there might be.\" His study took a step back and looked for related patterns over the entire basin.Kossin analyzed two datasets gathered over three 23-year periods from 1947 to 2015. The first dataset, from the historical record of hurricane observations maintained by the U.S. National Hurricane Center, supplied observations taken every six hours and included information on location, maximum winds and central pressure.The second, an environmental data set from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction and the National Center for Atmospheric Research, provided a benchmark for sea surface temperatures and wind shear for the period of interest.Overall, when the tropics generate many hurricanes -- during periods of low wind shear and high ocean temperatures in the tropical Atlantic -- they also create a situation where those hurricanes lose energy if they approach the coast, as they encounter a harsh environment of higher wind shear and cooler ocean temperatures.\"They have to track through a gauntlet of high shear to reach the coast and many of them stop intensifying,\" Kossin says. \"It is a natural mechanism for killing off hurricanes that threaten the U.S. coast.\"What are the implications for U.S. coastal regions? \"It is good news,\" says Kossin. \"Greater activity produces more threats, but at the same time, we increase our protective barrier. It's pretty amazing that it happens to work that way.\"The data suggest we may be moving into another quieter period in the basin, however, where less activity works hand in hand with lower wind shears along the coast, eradicating the protective barrier. As a result, says Kossin, while there may be fewer hurricanes approaching the coast, those that do may be much stronger, in the range of Category 3 to Category 5.The threat of rapid strengthening is highly relevant to society, in particular to those who live along densely populated coastlines where the warning times for evacuation may already be short.\"Knowing the relationship between tropical activity and coastal conditions that either protect the coast or make it more vulnerable may help us better prepare for future landfalls,\" Kossin says.Like any research study, the results raise more questions. For instance, how might climate change affect this relationship? Other studies, says Kossin, have documented a rise in sea surface temperatures -- a shift attributed to anthropogenic climate change. But the sea surface trend does not seem to be having a large effect on hurricane activity in the coastal region, at least over the past 70 years or so.Kossin says this could fall under the heading of a \"climate surprise\" if the environmental conditions responsible for the protective barrier during active periods are compromised by climate change.\"There is no reason to think that this is a stationary mechanism,\" says Kossin. \"It's entirely possible that changes in climate could affect the natural barrier and thus significantly increase coastal hazard and risk.\""}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_175", "content": "Using onboard GPS and cellphone-grade sensors, each drifting balloon becomes part of a ``swarm'' of robotic vehicles, which can periodically report, via satellite uplink, their position, the local temperature, pressure, humidity and wind velocity.This new, comparatively low-cost sensing strategy promises to provide much-needed in situ sampling of environmental conditions for a longer range of time and from many vantage points within developing hurricanes. This has the potential to greatly improve efforts to estimate and forecast the intensity and track of future hurricanes in real time.Current two to five day forecasts of many hurricanes deviate significantly from each other, and from the truth. For example, as Hurricane Matthew churned toward the eastern seaboard in early October of 2016, various news outlets reported \"forecasts\" like \"Hurricane Matthew will probably make landfall somewhere between Charleston and Boston, so everyone brace yourselves.\"\"Guidance like this is entirely inadequate for evacuation and emergence response preparations,\" said Thomas Bewley, a professor at the Jacobs School of Engineering at UC San Diego and the paper's senior author.Improved forecasts, to be greatly facilitated by improved in situ environmental sampling, are essential to protect property and save lives from such extreme environmental threats, he added.Key challenges in this effort include the design of small, robust, buoyancy-controlled balloons that won't accumulate ice; the efficient coordination of the motion of these balloons to keep them moving within the hurricane, between an altitude of 0 and 8 kilometers (about 5 miles); and to keep them well distributed over the dynamically significant regions within the hurricane, for up to a week at a time.Bewley and UC San Diego post-doctoral researcher Gianluca Meneghello detail various aspects of their work on this problem in the October 2016 issue of the The model for large-scale coordination of balloon swarms within hurricanes, as discussed in the Physical Review Fluids article, uses a clever strategy to model predictive control by leveraging the cutting-edge Weather Research and Forecasting code developed by the National Center for Atmospheric Research, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA).`The key idea of our large-scale balloon coordination strategy,'' said Bewley, \"is to `go with the flow,' commanding small vertical movements of the balloons and leveraging the strong vertical stratification of the horizontal winds within the hurricane to distribute the balloons in the desired fashion horizontally.\"Intermediate-scale and small-scale fluctuations in the violent turbulent flow of a hurricane, which are unresolved by forecasting codes like WRF, are quite substantial. The researchers' strategy? \"We simply ride out the smaller-scale fluctuations of the flow,\" said Meneghello. \"The smaller-scale flowfield fluctuations induce something of a random walk in the balloon motion. We model these fluctuations statistically, and respond with corrections only if a balloon deviates too far from its desired location in the formation.\"As summarized in their ISSF paper, the researchers' strategy for applying such corrections, dubbed Three Level Control (and endearingly abbreviated TLC), applies a finite shift to the vertical location of the displaced balloon for a short period of time, again leveraging the strong vertical stratification of the horizontal winds to return the balloon to its nominal desired location.A third essential ingredient of the project, summarized in the researchers' IEEE paper, is the design of small (about 3 kg or 6.5 lbs.), robust, energetically-efficient, buoyancy-controlled balloons that can survive, without significant accumulation of ice, in the cold, wet, turbulent, electrically active environment of a hurricane. The balloons can operate effectively for up to a week at a time on a battery charge not much larger than that of a handful of iPhones. \"Cellphone-grade technologies, for both environmental sensors as well as low-energy radios and microprocessors, coupled with new space-grade balloon technology developed by Thin Red Line Aerospace, are on the cusp of making this ambitious robotic sensing mission feasible,\" said Bewley.In addition to robotics, Bewley's team specializes in the field of control theory, which is the essential \"hidden technology\" in many engineering applications, such as cruise control and adaptive suspension systems in cars, stability augmentation systems in high-performance aircraft and adaptive noise cancellation in telecommunication. Control theory made it possible for SpaceX rockets to land on barges at sea. Though the math and numerical methods involved are sophisticated, the fundamental principle is straightforward: sensors take measurements of the physical environment, then a computer uses these measurements in real time to coordinate appropriate responses by the system (in this case, the buoyancy of the balloons) to achieve the desired effect.Bewley, Meneghello and colleagues are now working towards testing the balloons and algorithms designed in this study in the real world. With sensor balloon swarms and the special TLC coming out of their lab, fire and safety officials may soon have a crucial extra couple of days to move people out of harm's way, and to prepare emergency responses, when the next Katrina or Sandy threatens."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_176", "content": "At the American Geophysical Union meeting this week, they report that their method worked with 91 percent accuracy.The project aims to curtail outages by helping power companies allocate equipment and crews in advance of storms, said Steven Quiring, professor of atmospheric sciences at The Ohio State University.Healthy trees that receive just the right amount of moisture are less prone to storm damage, he explained, so soil moisture is a good indicator of where outage crews will be needed.\"We see increased numbers of outages at both ends of the spectrum -- wherever soils are too wet or too dry,\" Quiring said. \"Drought makes tree branches more likely to snap off, and over-saturation makes trees more likely to be uprooted.\"He cited a 2012 report from the Congressional Research Service that named severe weather as the single biggest cause of outages in the United States. More specifically, severe weather damage to vegetation is the biggest cause. Around 62 percent of the time, the report concluded, the power goes out because broken tree branches or falling trunks contact power lines.For Hurricane Matthew, the researchers were able to forecast five days ahead of time that 4.5 million people would be without power in Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia. The actual number worked out to be around 4.1 million, so the researchers overestimated the extent of outages by around 9 percent.NASA's Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite mission provided the data, which the researchers cross-referenced with population density, land use, average wind speed and the duration and intensity of storms to make their forecast model.The team, which includes Seth Guikema at the University of Michigan and Brent McRoberts at Texas A&M, has been using a similar computer model -- minus the NASA SMAP soil moisture measurements -- to predict hurricane-caused power outages for about a decade. For instance, they correctly estimated that superstorm Sandy would knock out power for about 10 million people in 2012.Quiring said the researchers are expanding the project to include outages caused by thunderstorms, winter storms and wind storms, which impact a much larger portion of the United States than hurricanes. They are already working with several power companies along the East Coast, and hope to form partnerships with companies in the Midwest and South next.Outages cost the American economy as much as $33 billion annually, according to the President's Council of Economic Advisers and the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_177", "content": "In a recent study, the scientists found that in high winds conditions the amount of large sea spray droplets (over 0.5 milimeters in diameter) generated is as much as 1000 times more than previously thought.Sea spray droplets are aerosol water particles that are ejected into the atmosphere as waves break at the ocean surface. The evaporation of sea spray is thought to contribute to the transfer of heat from the ocean to the atmosphere, which accelerate winds in a storm, potentially impacting its intensity.To characterize the role these large droplets play at the air-sea surface, the researchers placed a high-resolution camera system outside of the Air-Sea Interaction Saltwater Tank (ASIST), one of the wind-wave basins in the UM SUSTAIN laboratory, to capture the silhouettes of water droplets flying through the air. For each image, an automatic identification algorithm was used to identify an individual droplet's location in space and their two-dimensional surface area. More than 35,000 individual images were acquired and processed for this study as part of the experimental trials. The wind speeds in the laboratory ranged from 80 to 120 miles per hour.In an analysis of how the droplet concentration changed with height above the ocean surface, they found that the vertical distribution of sea spray diverged from the existing theoretical distribution, which means the number of water droplets for a given air volume at a specific height above the ocean surface was significantly different than the predicted concentration. This information is critical to understanding the depth of the spray layer above the ocean surface and the overall impact of spray on storm intensity.\"Our work can be directly applied to a hurricane model to help improve hurricane intensity predictions, which will help people make more informed decisions with regard to their safety,\" said David Ortiz-Suslow, a Ph.D. candidate at the UM Rosenstiel School and lead author of the study.Over the last 10 years, scientists have made significant progress in predicting the track of tropical cyclones up to 72 hours. Three days before Hurricane Katrina made landfall in New Orleans, the National Weather Service predicted the hurricane would hit the Florida Panhandle, approximately 250 miles away. This year, Hurricane Matthew's actual verses predicted paths were less than 50 miles apart in the 72-hour window. Intensity forecasting has not improved as sufficiently over the last 10 years."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_178", "content": "Coastal communities' ability to plan for, absorb, recover and adapt from destructive hurricanes is becoming more urgent. As of 2010, approximately 52 percent of the United States' population lived in vulnerable coastal watershed counties, and that number is expected to grow. Globally, almost half of the world's population lives along or near coastal areas.\"In general, risk management has not been sufficiently focused on coastal resilience, with community stakeholders involved in the process of making their coastline, as a system, more resilient to coastal storms,\" according to the study, \"Enabling Stakeholder Involvement in Coastal Disaster Resilience Planning,\" by George Washington University researchers Thomas Bostick, Thomas Holzer, and Shahryar Sarkani. Their study was published in the online version of Risk Analysis, a publication of the Society for Risk Analysis.\"This research demonstrates a methodology for involving stakeholders in discussions that make their coastlines more resilient,\" says Bostick. After disasters strike, local stakeholders are often surprised and frustrated with the damages inflicted on their communities and seek greater involvement in reducing risk. That frustration can be addressed by investing more in physical infrastructures to protect against flooding. But the needed infrastructure can be expensive, such as the $14.5 billion the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers was given to reinforce New Orleans after the 2005 destruction caused by Hurricane Katrina, an amount of federal support that most high risk areas are unlikely to receive.Recognizing that a methodology was missing for integrating coastal stakeholders into the process of identifying and selecting of resilience-enhancing projects, the authors conducted a case study with data from a stakeholder meeting in Mobile Bay, Alabama, to demonstrate a method for engaging stakeholders over a longer period to identify what the group considered the community's most significant critical functions and project initiatives to preserve those functions under different scenarios. Mobile Bay, Alabama's only port for ocean-going ships and an entry point for smaller recreational and commercial vessels, has seen population growth and accompanying demand for housing, infrastructure development, and other changes that have impacted natural ecological systems. During tropical storms and hurricane events, Mobile Bay's Eastern Shore is vulnerable to coastal erosion and sediment transfer into the bay.A workshop involving approximately 30 participants was held in 2015 at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Disaster Response Center in Mobile, Alabama, to test methods to calculate resilience for the Mobile Bay region. Participating stakeholders worked with subject matter experts in systems engineering, coastal engineering, risk and decision analysis, and other fields to develop a set of proposed projects to address key resilience stages and domains.Resilience domains include the physical (built infrastructure as well as wetlands, dunes, and other natural features), information (policies, building codes, evacuation routes, and other materials), cognitive (human processes for sharing and acting upon knowledge to make, communicate, and implement decisions), and social (\"interactions, organizations, people, and policies that influence how decisions are made,\" such as government flood insurance, religions, cultures, and languages). \"Coastal communities can improve resilience not only in the physical domain, but also in the information, cognitive and social domains,\" says Bostick. The methodology described in the study is intended to support such improvements.Through the workshop, stakeholders generated 11 project initiatives, including, for example, reducing saltwater intrusion, environmental and coastal storm education, utility pole replacement, removing scrap metal, and reducing impervious surfaces. The subject matter experts aligned the initiatives with the four critical stages associated with resilience: preparing, absorbing, recovering, and adapting. Participants also identified a set of critical functions, such as telecommunication, electricity, housing, clean water, the tourism industry, and others.In reviewing the workshop results, the authors note that their study does not seek to measure whether a community or a coastline is resilient or not because there \"is clearly no agreement on how this would be accomplished.\" However, the methodology offers stakeholders an opportunity to understand the concept of resilience and scenarios and, based on this understanding, to make informed choices on how to improve the coastal resilience in their community. \"This is a capability that does not currently exist,\" the authors write."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_179", "content": "Hurricanes have gradually moved northwards from the western Caribbean towards northern North America over the past few hundred years, the study led by Durham University, UK, found.The researchers suggest that this change in hurricane track was caused by the expansion of atmospheric circulation belts driven by increasing carbon dioxide emissions.New York and other major cities along the Northeast coast of the USA could come under increased threat from these severe storms and need to be better prepared for their potential impact, the researchers said.The findings are published in the journal They found that the average number of hurricanes at the Belize site decreased over time. When the hurricane history of Belize was compared with documentary hurricane records from places such as Bermuda and Florida, this information showed that Atlantic (Cape Verde) hurricanes were moving to the north rather than decreasing in total numbers.Although natural warming over the centuries has had some impact on shifting hurricane tracks, the researchers found a marked decrease in hurricane activity in the western Caribbean coinciding with the late 19th Century industrial boom associated with increasing carbon dioxide and sulphate aerosol emissions to the atmosphere.The researchers said that initial regional cooling of the Northern Hemisphere due to increased industrial aerosol emissions should have pushed the hurricane tracks southward since Industrialization.But they added that rising amounts of atmospheric carbon dioxide had overridden this effect by expanding the Hadley cell -- a pattern of circulating air in Earth's tropical belt -- pushing hurricane tracks further north, away from the western Caribbean towards the Northeastern USA.This suggests that from the late 19th Century, humanmade emissions have become the main driver behind shifting hurricane tracks by altering the position of global weather systems, the researchers said.If future trends in carbon dioxide and industrial aerosol emissions continue as expected, hurricanes could shift even further northward, exacerbating the risk to the Northeast coast of the USA, they added.In 2012, Hurricane Sandy struck the Caribbean and much of the eastern seaboard of the United States, stretching as far north as Canada. At least 233 people died as a result of the storm.A large number of US states were affected by Hurricane Sandy with New York and New Jersey suffering the greatest impacts. The estimated cost of the damage caused by Hurricane Sandy in the USA is said to have run into tens of billions of dollars.The study's lead author, Dr Lisa Baldini, in the Department of Geography, Durham University, said: \"Our research shows that the hurricane risk to the Northeastern coast of the United States is increasing as hurricanes track further north.\"Since the 19th Century this shift was largely driven by humanmade emissions and if these emissions continue as expected this will result in more frequent and powerful storms affecting the financial and population centres of the Northeastern United States.\"Given the devastation caused by Hurricane Sandy it is important that plans are put in place to protect against the effects of similarly destructive storms which could potentially occur more often in the future.\"Co-author Dr Amy Frappier, of the Geosciences Department, Skidmore College, USA, said the research showed Atlantic hurricanes were responding to warming. Dr Frappier said: \"Aerosols from volcanoes and industrialisation in the Northern Hemisphere have a cooling effect, which tend to shift moisture belts and hurricane tracks southward, closer to the equator.\"On the other hand, warming from more carbon dioxide in the air tends to expand Earth's tropical belt, pushing hurricane tracks further north away from the western Caribbean and towards the Northeastern US.\"This suggests that the tracks of Atlantic hurricanes have responded more to warming than to regional cooling.\" The researchers added that the northward shift in hurricane tracks may not reduce the risk of tropical cyclones in the Caribbean.Co-author Dr James Baldini, in Durham University's Department of Earth Sciences, said: \"Although hurricane tracks have gradually moved northwards away from the western Caribbean, rising sea surface temperatures could promote the development of cyclonic storms within the western Caribbean.\"Consequently tropical cyclone activity across the western Caribbean may remain essentially stable over the current century, which has important implications for water availability in this region.\"However, increased sea surface temperatures also provide extra energy, potentially fueling larger storms. We therefore need to prepare for the effects of more frequent landfalls of larger storms along the Northeast coast of the United States and stronger storms impacting the Caribbean.\""}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_180", "content": "Following the spill, the length of shoreline that receded more than 13 feet (4 meters) a year quadrupled compared to the year before the spill. The land losses occurred mainly in areas where oil had washed ashore during the spill.A research team led by Amina Rangoonwala of USGS used airborne remote sensing imagery to analyze shoreline loss across nearly the entire upper Barataria Bay, located on the western side of the Mississippi River Delta, beginning a year before the spill and extending for 2.5 years after it. To determine whether the erosion was likely to be caused by the oil, they also compared shoreline loss linked to the deposited oil with shoreline erosion caused by high waves from Hurricane Isaac in 2012.The team found that although erosion occurred at isolated sections of the shoreline before the spill, the pre-spill shoreline (as analyzed from 2009 to 2010) was largely stable. In the first year after the spill (2010 to 2011), the erosion pattern changed dramatically from isolated to widespread. Erosion occurred mainly along shorelines with documented heavy to moderate oil coating. In the second year after the spill (2011 to 2012), the higher loss rates extended to areas that had less oil coating. Oil is known to weaken or kill vegetation, leading to loss of the roots that help hold soil together.In August 2012, two months after the two-year post-spill period, Hurricane Isaac made a direct hit on Barataria Bay. Erosion rates measured in the four months after the hurricane were higher than those measured after the spill. But this erosion occurred primarily on just a few shorelines that before the spill showed evidence of heightened susceptibility to wave-generated erosion.\"Our study uniquely shows that the patterns of shoreline recession seen in this region can be directly related to distinctly different causes: broadly dispersed erosion due to oiling from the Deepwater Horizon spill, and enhanced, but spatially limited, erosion due to intense storm impacts,\" said Rangoonwala.The wetland impacts of the spill documented by the team included both the loss of wetlands due to shoreline erosion, and island fragmentation, where small islands are broken into even smaller islands, creating more shoreline. Land lost from fragmentation is unlikely to be reestablished, particularly in this part of the Mississippi River delta where levees prevent an influx of new sediments from the river. This will alter natural coastal defenses against flooding.The images collected in the annual surveys and following Hurricane Isaac were obtained from NASA's Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar (UAVSAR), developed and managed by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California. UAVSAR flies on a C-20A research aircraft based at NASA's Armstrong Flight Research Center facility in Palmdale, California. UAVSAR's polarized radar produced detailed representations of the marsh, which USGS scientists then used to develop a process to analyze the shoreline recession by mapping the change in shore location.\"Through this process, USGS and NASA scientists developed a repeatable, quantitative mapping method that will allow us to monitor shoreline erosion after oil spills in the future,\" said study co-author Cathleen Jones of JPL. \"Being able to compare shoreline losses in a year without any major storm to losses both after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill and after the hurricane was essential to correlating the erosion of the marsh to its underlying causes.\"The study, \"Wetland shoreline recession in the Mississippi River Delta from petroleum oiling and cyclonic storms,\" is published in the journal NASA collects data from space, air, land and sea to increase our understanding of our home planet, improve lives and safeguard our future. NASA develops new ways to observe and study Earth's interconnected natural systems with long-term data records. The agency freely shares this unique knowledge and works with institutions around the world to gain new insights into how our planet is changing.Developed to test new technologies and study Earth surface dynamics, UAVSAR is informing the design and planning for a future spaceborne radar mission, the NASA-ISRO Synthetic Aperture Radar (NISAR), which is planned to image almost the entire Earth's surface at least once every 12 days.For more information on UAVSAR, visit: For more information on NISAR, visit: For more information about NASA's Earth science activities, visit:"}

So, I suggested to our cardiology fellows that we study the data to look at this phenomenon objectively to determine whether this was a real increase or only a perception.\"Investigators found that hospital admissions to Tulane Medical Center for heart attacks increased three-folds in the 10 years after Katrina (post-Katrina), compared to the two years before the storm in August 2005 (pre-Katrina).In addition, post-Katrina patients were significantly more likely to have other risk factors for heart attack, including:\"Although the general emphasis after an event such as Katrina is on rebuilding, we should not neglect the health of those affected by a disaster,\" Irimpen said. \"This massive natural disaster may have had a greater impact on the development of chronic medical diseases than originally realized.\"In other findings, the study identified additional potential health problems among the post-storm group. For example, these patients were more than twice as likely to abuse drugs and/or to have a psychiatric disease as their pre-Katrina counterparts. In addition, unemployment and a lack of health insurance were significantly more frequent among the post-Katrina group of patients. Post-Katrina patients were also more likely to receive prescriptions for heart-disease medications and drugs to lower cholesterol and high blood pressure, although they were only half as likely to take their medication, compared to the pre-Katrina group.For this single-center study, investigators examined 150 records for heart attack patients admitted to Tulane Medical Center in the two years before Katrina, and 2,341 records in the 10 years afterwards.Since the study was observational, it only found an association between Katrina and an increase in heart attacks, not a cause of the increase. In addition to this limitation, the study involved patients at a single hospital and could not control for all possible influences on heart attack risk since data relied on medical records of past heart attacks.According to the American Heart Association, heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States. Each year, more than half a million people have a first heart attack, and about 200,000 have a recurrent one.The good news is that risk for heart attack can be lowered with lifestyle changes such as avoiding smoking, eating a healthy diet, controlling high blood cholesterol and blood pressure, being physically active, controlling our weight, managing diabetes, reducing stress, and limiting alcohol, according to the American Heart Association."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_182", "content": "Global temperatures for January to September 2016 have been about 0.88Â° Celsius (1.58Â°F) above the average (14Â°C) for the 1961-1990 reference period, which is used by WMO as a baseline. Temperatures spiked in the early months of the year because of the powerful El NiÃ±o event of 2015-16. Preliminary data for October indicate that they are at a sufficiently high level for 2016 to remain on track for the title of hottest year on record. This would mean that 16 of the 17 hottest years on record have been this century (1998 was the other one).Long-term climate change indicators are also record breaking. Concentrations of major greenhouse gases in the atmosphere continue to increase to new records. Arctic sea ice remained at very low levels, especially during early 2016 and the October re-freezing period, and there was significant and very early melting of the Greenland ice sheet.Ocean heat was boosted by the El NiÃ±o event, contributing to coral reef bleaching, and above-average sea-level rise.The deadliest event so far in 2016 has been Hurricane Matthew, which was Haiti's worst humanitarian emergency since the 2010 earthquake. Throughout the year, extreme weather led to considerable socio-economic losses in all regions of the world.\"Another year. Another record. The high temperatures we saw in 2015 are set to be beaten in 2016,\" said WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas. The extra heat from the powerful El NiÃ±o event has disappeared. The heat from global warming will continue,\" he said.\"In parts of Arctic Russia, temperatures were 6Â°C to 7Â°C above the long-term average. Many other Arctic and sub-Arctic regions in Russia, Alaska and northwest Canada were at least 3Â°C above average. We are used to measuring temperature records in fractions of a degree, and so this is different,\" said Mr Taalas.\"Because of climate change, the occurrence and impact of extreme events has risen. 'Once in a generation' heatwaves and flooding are becoming more regular. Sea level rise has increased exposure to storm surges associated with tropical cyclones,\" he said.\"The Paris Agreement came into force in record time and with record global commitment. The World Meteorological Organization will support the translation of the Paris Agreement into action,\" he said.\"WMO is working to improve monitoring of greenhouse gas emissions to help countries reduce them. Better climate predictions over timescales of weeks to decades will help key sectors like agriculture, water management, health and energy plan for and adapt to the future. More impact-based weather forecasts and early warning systems will save lives both now and in the years ahead. There is a great need to strengthen the disaster early warning and climate service capabilities of especially developing countries. This is a powerful way to adapt to climate change,\" said Mr Taalas.WMO published the provisional statement for 2016 to inform the United Nations Climate Change conference taking place in Marrakech, Morocco (COP22). The final statement will be released in early 2017. For the first time, the assessment includes input from UN partners on the humanitarian impact.It complements a report on the 2011-2015 global climate, which was also submitted to COP22 to give a longer-term picture of the climate and to address multi-year events like droughts. That report showed that, of 79 studies published by the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society between 2011 and 2014, more than half found that human-induced climate change contributed to the extreme event in question. Some studies found that the probability of extreme heat increased by 10 times or more.Global temperatures for January to September 2016 were approximately 1.2Â°C above pre-industrial levels and 0.88Â°C (1.58Â°F) above the average for the 1961-1990 reference period. They were especially warm in the early months of the year, with record monthly anomalies of +1.12Â°C (+2.02Â°F) in February and +1.09Â°C (+1.96Â°F) in March. Operational October data from the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting ERA-40 reanalysis indicate that October temperature anomalies were similar to May to September ones.Temperatures were above the 1961-90 average over the vast majority of land areas. In parts of Arctic Russia around the Ob River estuary and Novaya Zemlya, they were 6Â°C to 7Â°C above average. Many other Arctic and sub-Arctic regions in Russia, Alaska and northwest Canada were at least 3Â°C above average. More than 90% of Northern Hemisphere land areas outside the tropics were at least 1Â°C above average. Temperatures were less extreme in the Southern Hemisphere, but many areas were still 1Â°C or more above average, including northern South America, northern and eastern Australia, and much of southern Africa.The only large land area with below-average temperatures was part of subtropical South America (northern and central Argentina, parts of Paraguay and lowland Bolivia).Temperatures were above normal over most ocean areas. This contributed to significant coral bleaching and disruption of marine ecosystems in some tropical waters, including the Great Barrier Reef off the east coast of Australia, and Pacific island countries such as Fiji and Kiribati. Coral mortality of up to 50% was reported in parts of the Great Barrier Reef.The most prominent area of below-normal sea surface temperatures was the Southern Ocean south of 45Â° South (especially around the Drake Passage between South America and Antarctica, where temperatures were more than 1Â°C below normal in places).Global sea levels rose about 15 millimetres between November 2014 and February 2016 as a result of El NiÃ±o, well above the post-1993 trend of 3 to 3.5 mm per year, with the early 2016 values reaching new record highs. Since February, sea levels have remained fairly stable.Annual average global carbon dioxide concentrations in 2015 reached 400 parts per million (ppm) for the first time. Initial observations indicate new records in 2016. At Cape Grim (Australia), COArctic sea ice extent was well below normal throughout the year. The seasonal minimum in September was 4.14 million square kilometres, the equal-second (with 2007) lowest extent on record after 2012. The winter maximum in March was the lowest on record. The autumn freeze-up has also been much slower than normal; the sea ice extent as of the end of October is the lowest on record for the time of year.After several years of well-above-normal values, Antarctic sea ice extent fell to near normal by the start of 2016. It reached a seasonal maximum nearly a month earlier than usual. It was still well below normal as of the end of October.Summer melting on the Greenland ice sheet was substantially above the 1990-2013 average, with especially strong melting in July, but was less than in the record melting year of 2012.Numerous weather events had major impacts in 2016. The most significant, in terms of casualties, was Hurricane Matthew in October. According to Haitian government figures at the start of November, there were 546 confirmed deaths and 438 injured as a result of the hurricane. After crossing Haiti, Matthew tracked north and went on to cause damage in Cuba and the Bahamas, before tracking along the east coast of the United States and making landfall in South Carolina, causing major flooding.The Yangtze basin in China had its most significant summer floods since 1999, killing 310 people and causing an estimated US$14 billion in damage. Flooding and landslides in Sri Lanka in mid-May left more than 200 people dead or missing, and displaced several hundred thousand. Above-normal seasonal rainfall in the Sahel led to significant flooding in the Niger River basin, with the river reaching its highest levels in about 50 years in Mali.There were a number of major heatwaves during 2016. The year started with an extreme heatwave in southern Africa, exacerbated by the ongoing drought. Many stations set all-time records, including 42.7Â°C at Pretoria and 38.9Â°C at Johannesburg on 7 January. Thailand saw a national record of 44.6Â°C on 28 April. Phalodi saw a new record for India of 51.0Â°C on 19 May. Record or near-record temperatures occurred in parts of the Middle East and north Africa on a number of occasions in summer. Mitribah (Kuwait) recorded 54.0Â°C on July 21 which, subject to ratification through standard WMO procedures, will be the highest temperature on record for Asia. The following day, 53.9Â°C was recorded at Basra (Iraq) and 53.0Â°C at Delhoran (Iran).The most damaging wildfire in Canadian history occurred in May in the city of Fort McMurray in Alberta. The fire ultimately burned an area of about 590,000 hectares and was Canada's most costly natural disaster. It led to the total evacuation of the city and ultimately destroyed 2,400 buildings, causing 4 billion Canadian dollars (US$3 billion) in insured losses and several billion more in other losses.Major droughts affected several parts of the world, most of them associated with the El NiÃ±o event, which had a big influence on precipitation. Southern Africa experienced a second consecutive bad rainy season in 2015-16. Most of the region normally receives little rain between May and October, and the World Food Programme estimates that 17 million people will require assistance during the \"lean season\" ahead of the next harvest in early 2017.Annual and long-term changes in the climate system can aggravate social, humanitarian and environmental pressure. According to International Organisation for Migration, population migration is expected to increase as a result of more frequent and potentially more intense weather-related disasters, competition and conflict over shrinking resources, and rising sea levels rendering coastal and low lying zones uninhabitable.According to United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees), in 2015 there were 19.2 million new displacements associated with weather, water, climate and geophysical hazards in 113 countries, more than twice as many as for conflict and violence. Of these, weather-related hazards triggered 14.7 million displacements. South and East Asia dominated in terms of the highest absolute figures, but no region of the world was unaffected. Equivalent data for 2016 are not yet available.Extreme weather and climate related events influenced by the strong El-NiÃ±o in 2015/2016 had significant negative impacts on agriculture and food security. More than 60 million people around the world were affected by these events, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization."}

It is consistent with smaller changes in the same patterns that we have observed over recent decades and project to continue over the next 100 years. I think it gives us greater confidence in some trends we are witnessing about how storms may change in future years.\"Researchers today know that the oceans continued to be relatively warm during the Pliocene era, though there has been some uncertainty where waters were warmest. Their study found that the increase in average intensity and in the poleward expansion occurred regardless of where the greatest change in temperatures occurred in the Pliocene.Korty says the study adds more evidence \"that future storms are likely to be stronger in their intensity and to remain strong even as they move out of the tropics.\""}

{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_185", "content": "Most recently, inland rainfall produced by Hurricane Matthew has caused record flooding in North Carolina, with the levels of some already swollen rivers and streams continuing to rise.According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), more than 50 percent of the deaths associated with hurricanes from 1970 to 2004 were caused by fresh water flooding. And from 1981 to 2011, hurricane damage accounted for almost half -- $417.9 billion -- of the total monetary damage from all weather and climate disasters during that same time period (adjusted for inflation to 2011 dollars).With the goal of providing basic information to help improve preparedness and mitigation efforts, new University of Iowa-led research published online in September in the Journal of Hydrology examined how accurate current forecasting systems are in predicting rainfall from North Atlantic tropical cyclones that reach land in the United States.Comparing five state-of-the-art weather prediction models, researchers found current models can forecast both where and how much rainfall a tropical cyclone will produce up to two days in advance. However, the forecast's accuracy decreased significantly when the prediction window increased to five days. The researchers' findings were based on 15 North Atlantic hurricanes that came within at least 500 kilometers of the U.S. coastline from 2007 to 2012.Gabriele Villarini, UI associate professor of civil and environmental engineering and corresponding author on the paper, says researchers honed in on predicting the impacts of tropical cyclones because that information is generally more useful than typical forecasts that predict how many storms are expected in a season.\"The more specific the information we can provide is, the more useful it will be. This is why we have been moving toward predicting U.S. landfalling tropical cyclone activity and the associated rainfall,\" he says.Villarini, also an associate research engineer at the UI's Iowa Flood Center, says while a 48-hour lead time is a good starting point in terms of warning, he will continue to conduct more research to improve these predictions.\"By improving our understanding of the processes that drive tropical cyclones and hurricanes, we will be better positioned to improve our ability to forecast these events and their impacts with longer and longer lead times,\" he says.Gabriel Vecchi, head of the climate variations and predictability group at NOAA's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Lab and another author on the paper, says decades of weather prediction data show that forecasts have improved -- and will improve -- as scientists learn more about hurricanes.\"We can't do anything about the past,\" he says. \"The goal of this work is to provide better information in the future.\"Vecchi, who has collaborated with Villarini on several research projects, says he values the expertise in flooding and hydrology that Villarini and the Iowa Flood Center bring to their partnership.\"This is one of these examples of interdisciplinary work that has been incredibly fruitful,\" he says."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_186", "content": "That's the outlook from David A. Robinson, a Rutgers geography professor who has served as the New Jersey state climatologist for 25 years.With the warming of New Jersey's climate expected to continue, the atmosphere will hold nearly 4 percent more moisture for every 1 degree Fahrenheit rise in temperature, according to Robinson. The increased warmth and moisture will lead to a more energetic atmosphere, and warmer sea surface temperatures will add fuel to the fire. Meanwhile, rising development in coastal areas has put more people in harm's way.\"You still need a trigger but we're primed for more significant storms that will produce heavy rainfall and heavy snowfall,\" he said.That doesn't mean storm frequency will rise because it's unclear whether the conditions that trigger storms will increase or decrease. But storm precipitation and wind speeds should increase, along with freshwater and storm surge flooding and wind damage, according to Robinson. And more intense tropical storms may make it up to the Jersey coastline and beyond, fueled by warmer ocean waters, researchers say.Robinson and Steven G. Decker, an instructor in Rutgers' Meteorology Undergraduate Program, say Sandy was not the worst possible storm in the region and they warn that as the sea rises, much weaker storms than Sandy may pack big punches.Since the early 1800s, several storms have posed greater threats in the mid-Atlantic region than Sandy. They include the 1821 hurricane that made landfall in Cape May, with sustained winds that may have topped 100 mph; the deadly 1938 hurricane that slammed into Long Island and southeastern New England; and the 1944 hurricane that cruised just off the New Jersey coast but dumped heavy rain, brought strong winds and spawned a significant surge, according to Robinson and Decker.Sandy's extreme storm surge and strong winds caused most of its damage. But a slower storm could cause far more coastal and inland flooding damage than Sandy, and future storms could unleash stronger winds along the coast and inland, they say.Last month, Hurricane Hermine threatened to cause major coastal flooding in New Jersey and other states, but moved farther east than computer models initially predicted, sparing the region its full fury.Anthony J. Broccoli, a meteorologist and professor who chairs Rutgers' Department of Environmental Sciences, said the consensus, based on computer simulations, is that the strongest hurricanes in the North Atlantic basin will get stronger by the end of this century.But that conclusion is far from iron-clad and it's also unclear if the number of hurricanes will increase, decrease or remain the same, Broccoli said.A more subtle question is how the hurricane threat to New Jersey will change over time, he said.\"A warmer climate could make it easier for storms to maintain their intensity as they move out of the tropics,\" he said. \"So even if there aren't more storms, there could be more storms that survive at a given intensity level and reach our latitude. Storm tracks also could change, and that could lessen or increase the threat to New Jersey.\"If damaging storms become more frequent, Robinson said, retreat from areas with mounting repetitive losses will become a topic of discussion.\"But we have such an investment along the Jersey coast that it's going to be one of the last places where people will back off,\" he said. \"Economically, it's an enormous part of the state, so you're going to see battles to deal with Mother Nature well into the future.\""}

Just hours after landfall, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on NASA's Terra satellite acquired a natural-color image that showed the western extent over the eastern tip of Cuba and the eastern-most extent over Puerto Rico.At NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland the NASA/NOAA GOES Project combined infrared and visible imagery from NOAA's GOES-East satellite into an animation of Matthew. The animation of imagery from Oct. 3 to Oct. 5 shows Hurricane Matthew making landfall in Haiti and eastern Cuba then move toward the Bahamas.On Oct. 5, there were many warnings and watches in effect on Oct. 5 from Cuba to the Bahamas to Florida.A Hurricane Warning is in effect for the Cuban provinces of Guantanamo, Santiago de Cuba, Holguin, Granma and Las Tunas; the Southeastern Bahamas, including the Inaguas, Mayaguana, Acklins, Crooked Island, Long Cay, and Ragged Island; the Central Bahamas, including Long Island, Exuma, Rum Cay, San Salvador, and Cat Island; the Northwestern Bahamas, including the Abacos, Andros Island, Berry Islands, Bimini, Eleuthera, Grand Bahama Island, and New Providence. In Florida a Hurricane Warning is in effect from north of Golden Beach to the Flagler/Volusia county line and Lake Okeechobee.A Hurricane Watch is in effect for the Cuban province of Camaguey and north of the Flagler/Volusia county line to Fernandina Beach. A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for Haiti, Turks and Caicos Islands. In Florida a Hurricane Watch is in effect for Chokoloskee to Golden Beach, the Florida Keys from Seven Mile Bridge eastward, and Florida Bay.At 11 a.m. EDT (1500 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Matthew was located near 21.8 degrees north latitude and 75.2 degrees west longitude. That's about 55 miles (90 km) north-northwest of Cabo Lucrecia, Cuba and about 105 miles (165 km) south of Long Island, Bahamas.The National Hurricane Center (NHC) said \"Matthew is moving toward the northwest near 12 mph (19 kph), and this motion is expected to continue during the next 24 to 48 hours. On this track, Matthew will be moving across the Bahamas through Thursday, and is expected to be very near the east coast of Florida by Thursday evening, Oct. 6.Maximum sustained winds are near 120 mph (195 kph) with higher gusts. Matthew is a category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale. Some strengthening is forecast during the next couple of days, and Matthew is expected to remain at category 3 or stronger while it moves through the Bahamas and approaches the east coast of Florida. Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km) from the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175 miles (280 km).\"The minimum central pressure reported by both Hurricane Hunter planes was 962 millibars.An unconfirmed wind gust of 155 mph (250 kph) was reported in Baracoa, Cuba, on the night of Oct. 4 as the eye of Matthew passed nearby.For storm specifics on rainfall, wind and storm surge, visit the NHC website:"}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_188", "content": "The report, Explaining ocean warming: causes, scales, effects and consequences, which was presented at the IUCN World Conservation Congress in Hawaii recently (5 September 2016), has found the upper depths of the world's oceans have warmed significantly since 1995.A chapter of the study, led by Professor Grant Bigg and Professor Edward Hanna from the University of Sheffield's Department of Geography, has revealed how this increase in sea temperatures has changed global weather patterns.The Sheffield scientists have shown that the rise in ocean temperatures has caused an increase in the number of severe hurricanes and typhoons, such as Hurricane Katrina, which devastated New Orleans in 2005, and Typhoon Haiyan, which caused massive destruction in the Philippines in 2013.Hurricanes have even been observed in the South Atlantic for the first time since satellite records began in the 1970s. The area was traditionally viewed as an unlikely region for hurricane formation because of its cooler sea surface temperatures, however in 2004 conditions were more favourable than normal due to warmer ocean temperatures, spawning Hurricane Catarina off the coast of Brazil.The report also shows that warmer seas have resulted in a significant loss of ice in the Arctic region. The atmosphere in the polar regions has warmed at about twice the average rate of global warming with Arctic coasts experiencing a rise in the occurrence of storm surges.This increase in storm surges can have a detrimental effect on fragile ecosystems in the area, such as low relief tundra, underlain by permafrost, according to the report.Warmer oceans have also caused a distinct change in El NiÃ±o events -- the warmer currents associated with the cycle have now been observed towards the central Pacific rather than the west, according to the Sheffield scientists.Professor Grant Bigg, from the University's Department of Geography, said: \"Many people may associate warmer seas with the pleasant weather conditions they're used to experiencing while on holiday, but the fact of the matter is that an increase in sea temperatures is having a huge impact on the world's weather.\"Our study has shown that severe hurricanes, storm surges, melting ice in the Arctic region and changes to El NiÃ±o are all being caused by sea temperatures rising across the planet. These are all things that can have a devastating impact on the way we live our lives.\"We hope that this research, together with studies presented by our colleagues in Hawaii this week, will help to shape the response of conservation and sustainable development to ocean warming.\"The report also predicts what implications warming seas may have for our planet in the near future if current trends continue.The continued warming of tropical oceans is likely to cause stresses on ecosystems, such as coral bleaching, and stronger tropical cyclones. It may also cause changes to climate over land, which could reduce crop production as temperatures rise.This research is part of a report on ocean warming by some of the world's leading climate change scientists.

He said: \"Storm surges are an abnormal increase of water levels in response to disruptive weather. They have the capacity to cause damaging flooding in coastal areas, especially when they coincide with high spring tides.\"The location and physical layout of the Firth of Clyde make it an area with high flooding risk. In this research, we used a three-dimensional hydrodynamic model to simulate surges in the Clyde during storms; our findings suggest that floods are caused not only by extreme surges but also by moderate surges coupled with high spring tides.\"The water level is also enhanced by a 'funneling' effect, which is linked to the depth of the river's floor and the complexity of the Clyde's sea coastline. Our findings suggested that the areas of the Clyde most exposed to severe surges were its firth and areas which resemble fjords.\"The storms with the highest water levels usually followed a particular pattern, with low pressure from the Atlantic moving to the north of mainland Scotland or further north. Regions such as the bay areas of the west coast in the US are usually protected from surges from outside but their basins are larger than that of the Clyde and their channels to the ocean are narrower.\"The study examined three storm surge incidents in December 2011 -- on the 13th and 28th of the month and a particularly severe storm on the 8th-9th of the month.The research was led by Dr Alessandro Sabatino, a Research Student in Strathclyde's Department of Mathematics & Statistics.

{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_190", "content": "The researchers plumbed data from a survey of Gulf Coast residents and found that the severity of the most recent storm a person weathered tended to play the largest role in determining whether they believed storms were getting worse over time, according to the study published in the Respondents' opinions also strongly differed depending on whether they were male or female, whether they believed in climate change and whether they were a Democrat or a Republican. For instance, people who believe in climate change were far more likely to perceive the increasing violence of storms than those who did not. The researchers noted that because climate change has become a politically polarizing issue, party affiliation also was an indicator of belief in strengthening storms.\"Understanding how people in coastal regions perceive the threat is important because it influences whether they will take the necessary actions to address that threat,\" said Ning Lin, the senior researcher on the study and a Princeton assistant professor of civil and environmental engineering.\"What you see is that there is often a gap between the reality of the storm trends and how people interpret those trends,\" said Siyuan Xian, a doctoral candidate in Lin's lab and co-lead author of the new paper.While scientists continue to debate the impact of climate change on the frequency and strength of hurricanes, numerous studies of objective measures -- such as wind speed, storm-surge height and economic damage -- show that hurricanes are stronger than they were even a few decades ago.For instance, eight of the 10 most economically damaging hurricanes since 1980 have occurred since 2004, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). In constant dollars, Hurricanes Katrina (2005) and Sandy caused nearly $154 billion and $68 billion in damage, respectively, according to NOAA.In comparison, the costliest storms of the 1990s, Hurricanes Andrew (1992) and Floyd (1999), caused $46 billion and $9 billion in damage (adjusted for inflation), respectively. Hurricane Patricia in 2015 was the strongest Western Hemisphere storm in recorded history with maximum sustained winds of 215 miles per hour.As the intensity of storms has increased, government agencies and coastal residents must grapple with preparing for the next landfall. Residents must decide, for example, whether to invest in storm shutters, roof and wall fortifications, flood-proof flooring and other structural buffers. On a larger scale, coastal planners need voter support to implement land-use policies that take the threat into account and to invest taxpayer dollars into protection measures such as seawalls or sand dunes.Understanding how people perceive the threat of hurricanes is crucial for predicting whether they will take them seriously, Xian said. Six hurricanes form each year in the North Atlantic on average, although as many as 15 have developed in a single hurricane season.\"If you perceive a higher risk, you will be more likely to support policies and take action to ameliorate the impacts,\" Xian said. \"We wanted to know how people perceive the threat of hurricanes and what influences their perceptions. This information will help guide how agencies communicate the risk, and what policies and actions are proposed to make communities resilient to these storms.\"Lin and Xian worked with co-authors Wanyun Shao, assistant professor of geography at Auburn University-Montgomery; Barry Keim, professor of climatology at Louisiana State University; and Kirby Goidel, a Texas A&M professor of communication.To explore what influences perceptions of hurricane threat, the researchers analyzed data from the 2012 Gulf Coast Climate Change Survey to analyze Gulf Coast residents' beliefs about hurricane trends from 1992 to 2011. Louisiana State University and NOAA conducted the survey.The survey focused on residents of Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida, who lived in areas of the Gulf Coast that experienced at least one hurricane landfall over the 20-year period from 1992 to 2011.In addition to probing beliefs about hurricane trends, the survey gathered information on respondents' gender, political affiliations, opinions on climate change and other characteristics that might influence their perspective on hurricane trends.The researchers' results mirrored a trend seen in other studies of extreme climate events, Lin said.\"The increasing power of Atlantic hurricanes is often connected to climate change, but studies have shown that Republicans and males tend to be more skeptical of climate change,\" Lin said. \"We found a strong link between disbelief in climate change and disbelief that storms are getting worse -- they tend to come as a package.\"The researchers were able to tease out what elements of the storms a respondent had experienced left the biggest impression on them. For instance, while storm surges tend to cause the most property damage, gale winds were more likely to convince people that hurricanes are getting stronger.Behavioral scientists have long hypothesized the most recent landfall of a storm has a stronger influence on people's perceptions of long-term climate trends, said Sander van der Linden, a postdoctoral researcher and lecturer in Princeton's Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs, and director of the Social and Environmental Decision-Making (SED) Lab. Van der Linden is familiar with the research but had no role in it.\"This study provides strong empirical evidence of this phenomenon,\" said van der Linden, who studies public policy from a behavioral-science perspective. \"This finding is important because it suggests that people may not be thinking about long-term changes in climate patterns but rather are paying attention to more salient variations in and impacts of short-term local weather.\"The study's authors said this information could help governments communicate hurricane risk more effectively to the public. Taking into account that people are more likely to respond to the threat of high winds, for instance, could help agencies such as the Federal Emergency Management Agency motivate the public to adequately prepare for storms. The researchers also recommended that public agencies work to further educate the public about the risk posed by storm surge.\"Public opinion can make or break policies intended to address climate change and ameliorate damage from storms,\" Lin said. \"Tapping into the state of current perceptions and what drives them will be critical for governments around the world as the impacts of climate change are increasingly felt.\"The researchers are currently conducting other studies related to climate-change perception, including research on flood adaption and insurance-purchasing behavior in the counties along the Gulf Coast, as well as looking at worldwide perceptions of climate change and the willingness to adopt green-energy technologies."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_191", "content": "\"So far, historical losses due to tropical cyclones have been found to increase less than linearly with a nation's affected gross domestic product (GDP),\" Tobias Geiger explains. \"However, if you analyze losses with respect to per capita income and population growth separately, this reveals a different picture: Our analysis for the United States shows that high income does not protect against hurricane losses. As the number and intensity of tropical cyclones is projected to increase under unchecked global warming, by the end of the century average hurricane losses with respect to national GDP could triple.\"The researchers worked with cutting-edge models linking the storm's wind speed, the exposed population, and per capita GDP to reported losses, using a newly designed data set for socio-economic and hazard-related predictors. \"We used information about historical hurricane tracks for the Eastern United States to identify the connection between the affected population, average per capital income and associated damages.,\" Katja Frieler adds. \"Finally, we applied this relationship to thousands of potential future hurricane tracks that could affect the Eastern United States until 2100 under different levels of global warming.\"\"Some people hope that a growing economy will be able to compensate for the damages caused by climate change -- that we can outgrow climate change economically instead of mitigating it. But what if damages grow faster than our economy, what if climate impacts hit faster than we are able to adapt?,\" Anders Levermann says. \"We find that this is the case with hurricane damages in the United States, the hope in economic growth as an answer to climate change is ill-founded. While adaptation to unavoidable impacts of global warming is important, climate mitigation remains of vital relevance to prevent or damp still avoidable consequences.\""}

The analysis also helps decision makers prepare resources needed for population movement in response to future extreme weather events, particularly in the Gulf Coast region. After a natural disaster, such as a high intensity hurricane, tens of thousands could be displaced to areas ill-equipped to handle the sudden influx of people for an unknown period of time.For this analysis, the research team examined impacts of population and temperature changes through 2050 in Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Texas, but Allen said that the method could be applied to other regions."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_193", "content": "So far, the warming effects of greenhouse gases on tropical cyclones have been masked, in part by air pollution.Over the past century, tiny airborne particles called aerosols, which cool the climate by absorbing and reflecting sunlight, largely cancelled out the effects of planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions when it came to tropical storm intensity, according to a new scientific review paper published this week in the journal That compensating effect won't continue if greenhouse gas warming keeps increasing, the scientists write. Using model simulations, they provide new calculations of the cancelling effects of aerosols and greenhouse gases on tropical cyclones worldwide. They also take a closer look at the still-developing understanding of how climate change will affect tropical cyclones, also known regionally as typhoons or hurricanes.\"The fact that global warming's fingerprints don't yet jump out at us when we look at hurricanes isn't surprising -- it's what current science tells us we should expect,\" said lead author Adam Sobel, a professor at Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory and School of Engineering. \"The same science tells us that those fingerprints will show up eventually in more ultra-powerful storms.\"The scientists examined a wide range of published analyses of tropical cyclone data and computer modeling, looking specifically at potential intensity, which predicts the maximum intensity that tropical cyclones could reach in a given environment. Their new global calculations of the cancelling effect follow a 2015 study led by Lamont's Mingfang Ting, with Suzana Camargo, also a coauthor on the new paper, that showed similar effects over the North Atlantic, where hurricanes that make landfall in the United States form.Many factors contribute to a tropical cyclone's intensity. At the most basic, the storm's convective strength -- the boiling motion of air rising from the ocean surface to the atmosphere -- depends on the temperature difference between the surface ocean and the upper atmosphere. Computer models that simulate the physics of tropical cyclones suggest that this difference should increase as the climate and sea surface temperatures warm, and that tropical storm strength should increase with it.Less well understood is how climate change should influence the number of tropical cyclones that form each year. Computer models indicate that while the total number of cyclones should decline in a warming climate, more intense, highly destructive storms like Super Typhoon Nepartak are likely to become more common.We have seen harbingers of that change in recent years: Typhoon Haiyan, also known as Yolanda, killed more than 6,300 people as it devastated parts of the Philippines as a Category 5 storm in 2013. Last year, Hurricane Patricia became the second most-intense tropical cyclone on record when its sustained winds reached 215 mph before weakening to hit Mexico with winds still powerful at 150 mph.The scientists' review finds that the largest increases in tropical cyclone potential intensity are expected to be at the margins of the tropics, particularly in the Atlantic and Pacific. The amount of rain that tropical storms bring is also expected to increase as the planet warms, due to increasing water vapor; and coastal flooding from storm surges that accompany tropical storms are expected to become more of a problem as sea levels rise. The scientists also describe a shift in tropical cyclone tracks toward the margins of the tropics, noting that it is unclear if the shift is a response to warming. Simulations for the western North Pacific suggest that it is, at least in part.Two factors make it difficult to detect greenhouse gas-related trends in tropical cyclone intensity, as the authors explain.One is the influence of aerosols. Model calculations indicate that aerosols have about twice the effect of greenhouse gases on a tropical cyclone's potential intensity. So while greenhouse gas levels have been greater than aerosol levels for many decades in terms of absolute magnitude -- which is why the planet has warmed by about 1.5?F since the Industrial Revolution -- they have only recently surpassed the cooling effect of aerosols in terms of their influence on tropical cyclone intensity.The other challenge is natural variability. Tropical cyclones are relatively rare -- the world averages around 90 per year -- and that number fluctuates from year to year and decade to decade, due in large part to natural causes. It is statistically difficult to detect long-term trends within that large natural variability, Sobel said. Satellite records that can monitor tropical storms worldwide also only go back to the 1970s.Scientists at Lamont, including Sobel, Camargo and coauthors Allison Wing and Chia-Ying Lee, are using both observations and computer models to expand understanding of how tropical cyclone behavior has changed and the physical mechanisms by which climate affects extreme weather. Among other projects, they are developing a tropical cyclone risk model that can be used in urban planning that incorporates climate factors in determining the probability of a tropical cyclone making landfall at a given location.The other coauthors of the paper are Michael Tippett of Columbia's School of Engineering, and Timothy Hall of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies.

Having a good idea of what people are likely to do, when they're likely to do it and how they are likely to go about it helps authorities choose the best evacuation strategy. It gives them useful information about what kind of traffic surge to expect and how best to steer it.Researchers at the University of Delaware's Disaster Research Center have been studying evacuation data and predictors for years and have published two new papers that may help to improve prediction models used by emergency planners, leading to more efficient evacuations and possibly saving lives.DRC includes scientists from multiple disciplines and collaborates with many others around the world. In these papers, they worked with researchers from Cornell University.\"It is an interdisciplinary project,\" said Rachel Davidson, professor of civil and environmental engineering and co-primary investigator with DRC Director Tricia Wachtendorf on two major National Science Foundation grants that have supported the study. \"And we're working closely with practitioners to make a link from research to practice.\"Sociologists, psychologists, engineers and meteorologists all have been part of the work, as have the Federal Emergency Management Agency, North Carolina State Emergency Management and the American Red Cross, Davidson said.The goal is to sharpen planners' insight on how many people may leave from a given area, when they are most likely to make their move and where they are likely to go.It's not easy to guess what a human being will do. The brain processes many factors as it moves toward a decision -- past experience, perception of risk and how it interprets present conditions, to name just a few. Those factors are hard to pin down in the best, most stable of times, let alone when the winds start to howl and the rain starts to pound.Hurricanes, too, can be quite unpredictable, as evidenced by the ever-changing \"cone of uncertainty\" included in forecasts as storm systems approach.But expansive review of data gathered in prior evacuations reveals patterns that can be analyzed and incorporated in regional models, based on mathematical predictions and controls, to strengthen the reliability of predictions in future storms.That's what the two new papers show. Both draw on data from the eastern part of hurricane-throttled North Carolina, where the Outer Banks and other coastal areas have seen more than their share of evacuation orders.One of the papers, published by \"Social and environmental cues influence behavior,\" said Sarah DeYoung, postdoctoral researcher at DRC who was the lead author of that paper and has just accepted a tenure-track position at the University of Georgia.\"But we understand, too, the temporal nature of that,\" Davidson said. \"It's not like people make a decision on Day 1 and follow through with that. They see what happens and change their minds, too.\"The study, based on survey data collected in 2011 through phone interviews with North Carolina residents in Wilmington, Raleigh, Jacksonville and the Outer Banks, looked at respondents' \"threshold for evacuation\" -- whether they had a high threshold and were less likely to evacuate or a low threshold and more likely to evacuate.Those lines moved a bit, depending on whether the storm discussed was a higher or lower category of strength and whether the evacuation order was mandatory or voluntary.But in general, DeYoung said, white respondents had a higher threshold than non-white respondents, a finding that was particularly interesting given that other studies in the United States suggest that non-whites evacuated later.\"This was really notable for us,\" said Wachtendorf, associate professor of sociology and the lead social scientist on the research. \"Is it that minority segments of the community are willing to leave but don't always have sufficient resources to do so? Is it because, as other research suggests, they have less trust in officials and, particularly after what happened after Hurricane Katrina, they believe they can't rely on officials if they stay? It really points to an area where more research is needed.\"Respondents who had ignored previous evacuation warnings were also more likely to ignore an order in the future.And DeYoung said most people saw wind as more dangerous than water, but in reality it is the storm surge and flooding that causes more deaths. Most hurricane-related deaths occur in areas where people decided not to evacuate. Wachtendorf said this could lead people to dismiss the threat of lower category storms, with relatively lower wind speeds, despite the threat flooding can pose.One recommendation is to increase public awareness of the risk associated with drowning and flooding versus the probability of death caused by wind damage.Research in progress points to other important factors in the decision-making process, including concern about traffic jams, caring for pets and livestock, and fear of crime in public shelters.\"It's a moving target,\" Davidson said. \"There are challenges in science and challenges in engineering. But understanding people's behavior is one of the most challenging parts.\"\"That's one reason why the interdisciplinary approach is so valuable,\" said Wachtendorf.The second paper, published on Science Direct in the journal The work by the civil engineers on the project used data collected by the social scientists to inform many of the assumptions for their models.Having reliable models puts the power of the knowledge into useful form for planners and helps them shape effective, efficient evacuation plans that could save lives in the future."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_195", "content": "The dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico affects nationally important commercial and recreational fisheries. Hypoxic zones or \"dead zones\" are caused by high levels of nutrients, primarily from activities such as industrialized agriculture and inadequate wastewater treatment.The low oxygen levels cannot support most marine life and habitats in near-bottom waters. Organisms that can flee the dead zones leave the area, while others which cannot leave are stressed or die of suffocation. Reducing nutrients flowing to the Gulf would help the situation since, under normal conditions, this area contains a diversity of marine life, critical habitats, and a number of key fisheries.\"Dead zones are a real threat to Gulf fisheries and the communities that rely on them,\" said Russell Callender, Ph.D., assistant NOAA administrator for the National Ocean Service. \"We'll continue to work with our partners to advance the science to reduce that threat. One way we're doing that is by using new tools and resources, like better predictive models, to provide better information to communities and businesses.\"The NOAA-sponsored Gulf of Mexico hypoxia forecast is improving due to advancements of individual models and an increase in the number of models used for the forecast. Forecasts based on multiple models are called ensemble forecasts and are commonly used in hurricane and other weather forecasts.This year marks the second year that a four-model forecast has been used. The four individual model predictions ranged from 5,204 to 6,823 square miles, and had a collective predictive interval of 3,200 to 8,597 square miles. The forecast assumes typical weather conditions, and the actual dead zone could be disrupted by hurricanes or tropical storms. Data from these four models are used to determine and meet the nutrient reduction targets set by the interagency Mississippi River/Gulf of Mexico Watershed Nutrient Task Force.The ensemble of models was developed by NOAA-sponsored modeling teams and researchers at the University of Michigan, Louisiana State University, Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium, Virginia Institute of Marine Sciences/College of William and Mary, Texas A&M University, North Carolina State University, and the United States Geological Survey. The hypoxia forecast is part of a larger NOAA effort to deliver ecological forecasts that support human health and well-being, coastal economies, and coastal and marine stewardship.The Gulf of Mexico hypoxia forecast is based on nutrient runoff and river and stream data from USGS. USGS estimates that 146,000 metric tons of nitrate and 20,800 metric tons of phosphorus flowed down the Mississippi and Atchafalaya rivers into the Gulf of Mexico in May 2016. This is about 12 percent above the long-term (1980-2015) average for nitrogen, and 25 percent above the long-term average for phosphorus.USGS operates more than 2,700 real-time stream gauges, 60 real-time nitrate sensors, and collects water quality data at long-term stations throughout the Mississippi River basin to track how nutrient loads are changing over time.\"By expanding the real-time nitrate monitoring network with partners throughout the basin, USGS is improving our understanding of where, when, and how much nitrate is pulsing out of small streams and large rivers and ultimately emptying to the Gulf of Mexico,\" said Sarah J. Ryker, Ph.D., acting deputy assistant secretary for water and science at the Department of the Interior. \"The forecast puts these data to additional use by showing how nutrient loading fuels the hypoxic zone size.\"The confirmed size of the 2016 Gulf dead zone will be released in early August, following a monitoring survey from July 24 to August 1, conducted on a NOAA vessel and funded through a partnership between NOAA, Northern Gulf Institute, and the Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_196", "content": "In the same way, strong storms -- such as Superstorm Sandy -- can leave a signature in the form of ripples on the seafloor.Known as ripple bedforms, these small, dynamic swells are formed when waves generate currents that oscillate back and forth on the seafloor, stirring up sediments and sand. The larger the distance between successive waves on the water's surface, theoretically, the larger the distance between the peaks of the ripples on the ocean floor below.According to Carter DuVal, a University of Delaware doctoral student studying oceanography, being able to measure and interpret these ripples can help scientists understand storms that have already happened, and also can help scientists model and predict how future storms will behave.DuVal is the lead author of a paper recently published in the journal Co-authors on the paper include Art Trembanis, associate professor of oceanography in UD's College of Earth, Ocean, and Environment, and Adam Skarke, a former student of Trembanis who is now an assistant professor of geology at Mississippi State University.The work is part of a wider study, started by Trembanis and colleagues in 2012 and sponsored by the Office of Naval Research, to examine the ecosystem and to create detailed maps of the seafloor at Redbird Reef, an artificial reef about 16 miles off the coast of the Indian River Inlet. The humanmade structure is comprised of old subway cars, tugboats, tires and military tract vehicles that provide a habitat for marine organisms, while encouraging recreational fishing and diving.The researchers have mapped Redbird Reef every year since 2008, except 2014. In 2012, they placed sensors and other instruments at Redbird Reef just prior to Hurricane Sandy to measure waves, currents and sand formations on the seafloor. During the height of the storm, the instruments recorded waves over 24 feet high and currents rushing back and forth across the seafloor at 5.2 feet per second.According to Trembanis, in order to predict erosion, storm surge and overwash at the beach, scientists must correctly predict how a wave will change as it moves across the continental shelf. This is particularly true on the East Coast, which is characterized by a broad, shallow continental shelf.\"At practical levels, if we are going to appropriately predict and model how storms are going to behave, we need to be able to determine ripple parameters, such as wavelength and orientation to the shoreline, with accuracy. Until we began using a fingerprint algorithm, we didn't have strong enough tools to do this,\" said Trembanis.Storms like Jonas, Joaquin and Sandy, he continued, all contained waves so long that they started to feel the ripples on the ocean floor almost 85 miles offshore. The ripples slow the waves and currents down, fundamentally changing the way they bend and lose energy as they travel across the ocean shelf -- and ultimately, how the waves break and end up on the beach.Part of the fingerprint algorithm's processing -- or job -- is to filter out areas that are featureless and focus only on areas with texture or directionality. This strengthened the researchers' data analysis because it only focuses on areas with ripples.The algorithm can also tell scientists where there aren't ripples, which may indicate areas where there is \"scour,\" meaning erosion, or hidden objects like a mine, pipeline, shipwreck or even unexploded ordinance. New developmentsAccording to DuVal, existing models predict that when a storm begins to wane, the ripples will reduce in size due to the smaller wave conditions. However, using the fingerprint algorithm to analyze data collected during Hurricane Sandy at Redbird Reef revealed that the ripples actually froze at the highest energy of the storm.\"So not only were we seeing a record of the storm, but of the most energetic part of the storm. This is very important for recording the storm's dynamics,\" explained DuVal.DuVal's work has focused on extending the fingerprint algorithm to help the researchers analyze the appearance of the ripples, specifically, whether the ripples were straight or curved or something else. Revisiting Redbird Reef multiple times over a year to take measurements and looking at these minute details over large areas, he explained, can help scientists understand a storm's long-lasting effects, especially how the ripples change over time.Months after Superstorm Sandy, for example, many of the smaller ripples that were initially present had disappeared, and larger ripples had been smoothed out into what Trembanis calls \"relic ripples.\"\"Relic ripples that are left behind can become the starting point for the next storm, or because they are somewhat rigid, they may slow down future storms,\" Trembanis said. Understanding their directionality, he continued, is important to distinguishing between the two.Running a finger across a 3-D printed model of a portion of the reef created from bathymetric sonar images and other data captured after the storm, DuVal is acutely aware of the widespread geographical and structural changes wrought by Superstorm Sandy.\"It gives you a perspective that you cannot get by looking at a two- or three-dimensional map on a screen,\" says DuVal. \"Not only can we look at the surface, but also the texture too.\"It also reminds DuVal and Trembanis of the timeliness of the work they are doing.According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, increased greenhouse gas concentrations are expected to \"increase the frequency, intensity and/or duration of extreme events.\"\"For the Mid-Atlantic, nor'easters really are the dominant storm. What we've seen by looking back at the records is that the energy level conditions we measured during Hurricane Sandy have a two and a half to three year recurrence interval,\" Trembanis said.Coincidentally, the researchers recently detected major changes at the Redbird site from winter storm Jonas, including some of the largest ripples they have ever seen. A large Navy barge that previously has been unmoved during Sandy and any other storm also appeared to have been rotated approximately 60 degrees and shifted approximately 160 feet by the January storm according to recent images.One thing is for sure: the UD researchers will be keeping an eye on the ripples and what they might reveal about the unprecedented weather patterns ahead."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_197", "content": "Getting the simulations right has huge societal implications, which is why one Goddard scientist chose this line of work.\"Freshwater floods, often caused by hurricanes, are the number one cause of death by natural disasters in the world, even above earthquakes and volcanoes,\" tropical meteorologist Oreste Reale with Goddard's Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO) said. \"Seeing how the research we do could have an impact on these things is very rewarding.\"Improved models can lead to better prediction and warning for these natural disasters, mitigating loss of life and property.Getting to the point of being able to accurately study hurricanes using computer models, however, is not easy. Because hurricanes are such complex storm systems, capturing their full nature in detail using a computer simulation is far from simple.\"We need to add complexity all the time and nobody here is afraid of doing that,\" Reale said. \"You don't want a simple solution. If it's simple, chances are it's not true.\"Adding complexity can include updating the models, incorporating data from new satellites, replacing old satellites and more.Reale and his colleague, Goddard tropical meteorologist Marangelly Fuentes, have more than 25 years' combined experience looking at modeled storms. In fact, Fuentes was Reale's student intern while she was earning her doctorate degree at Howard University in Washington, D.C. They belong to a team in the GMAO whose goal is to assess whether new data types are used efficiently in computer models, and to ensure that changes and updates improve the performance of models and their data assimilation systems compared to previous versions. Data assimilation refers to the process through which data or observations are incorporated into an existing model.\"Mostly I look at tropical forecasting and the analysis of tropical cyclones in the models, so we monitor how the different models are performing with tropical storms,\" Fuentes said.This includes comparing the performance of GMAO's weather and climate models with others in the U.S. and around the world. Fuentes looks at current versions of the GMAO model and compares them with newer, updated versions in development. By comparing the results of newer simulations on past, well-known storms, she can verify if the updated model version will be more effective at predicting the track and intensity of future storms.\"We are able to use cases like Hurricane Katrina to run tests and show us how we can improve, or how this new change affected the forecast or the analysis of the storm system,\" Fuentes said.The closer the results are to the actual behavior of the storm, the more accurate the model.Fuentes has worked extensively on the intensity prediction of Hurricane Katrina. Weather models in 2005 -- the year Katrina struck the Gulf Coast with devastating results -- predicted that the storm's pressure would reach as low as 955 millibars, significantly underestimating how low Katrina's atmospheric pressure would get, and therefore the storm's intensity. Observed data show that pressure in Hurricane Katrina's eye reached a minimum of 902 millibars, one of the 10 lowest pressure readings on record for an Atlantic hurricane. The most modern model produced by the GMAO, which Fuentes has been analyzing, can produce a model of Katrina's pressure much closer to the actual observed levels from 2005.Changes to these predictions are caused by improvements in data assimilation and model resolution, made possible by increased computer processing power. Improving the resolution of the model works similarly to increasing the resolution of a photo. The more pixels, or dots of color, in a square inch of a photo, the higher the resolution. High-resolution photos appear sharper and capture more detail than their low-resolution counterparts. Likewise, higher-resolution models produce more detailed simulations of hurricanes, giving researchers a better understanding of their behavior.\"In the model we basically transform Earth's atmosphere into little 'cubes' and in each cube the fundamental equations controlling motion, energy and continuity of the atmosphere are solved,\" Reale said. \"The smaller the size of the cube, the more realistic the representation of the atmosphere.\"Reale said that high model resolution is a critical factor in capturing hurricanes accurately. Luckily, there has been much improvement to model resolution in the past 10 years.In 2005, the record year of 27 named tropical storms or hurricanes in the Atlantic, the size of the \"cubes\" in GMAO's model was about 31 miles (50 km). Today, the resolution is three to four times higher at about 8 miles (12.5 km), giving scientists a much clearer and more detailed look at the state of the atmosphere.Of course, Reale said, there's still work to be done. \"There's no such thing as perfect in research and science, but there is certainly a big improvement for the intensity that contemporary models could predict if they had to face a situation like that again,\" he said.Reale believes this is the team to do it. \"I feel that I'm part of an organization that is extremely successful in facing many different aspects of science,\" he said. \"There are people from all over the world, and I'm sure that whatever question or issue I may have, there's someone who knows the answer in this building. I can tap into the knowledge and experience of so many people.\""}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_198", "content": "Prior to this study, no hurricane prediction model incorporated the vast amount of data collected by 'hurricane hunters,' which are NOAA or U.S. Air Force airborne reconnaissance missions that fly into hurricanes to collect data.\"Hurricane hunting has existed in the U.S. since the 1940s, and planes have included on-board radar since the 1970s,\" said Yonghui Weng, meteorology research associate, Penn State. \"Unfortunately, before our study, only a small portion of this radar data was being used in predictive hurricane models. Their main use was to probe the intensity and structure of the storm, and this information is given to forecasters.\"Hurricane hunters initiate their first mission as soon as the hurricane is within flying distance, and they continue to fly missions to collect data throughout the duration of the hurricane. This data is fed into statistical and dynamical models that generate many variations of possible hurricane paths and intensity.\"Typically, aircrews use three different types of equipment -- radar, on-plane sensors and devices dropped into the hurricane called dropsondes -- to collect data on the physical structure, wind speed, direction, temperature and moisture of storms,\" said Fuqing Zhang, professor of meteorology, Penn State. \"Because of technological advances in data processing, statistical algorithm and scientific computing, we are now able to assimilate more of this data into prediction models than previously.\"For example, prior to this study, the National Hurricane Center's hurricane prediction model used data collected from the outside portion of the storm but not the inner core.Predicting a hurricane's path has increased in accuracy in the past few decades, but predicting intensity has been a longstanding challenge for researchers. Weng and Zhang investigated whether better use of hurricane hunter data could lead to improved intensity forecasts. They present their findings in an invited paper in the August issue of the Using Penn State's real-time hurricane prediction system, developed by Zhang's team, in particular Weng, they 'hindcasted,' or retroactively forecasted, the intensity and path of 23 hurricanes and tropical cyclones occurring between 2008 and 2012. Using one forecast with reconnaissance data and one without, they compared their predictions with the storm's actual path and intensity. Then in 2013 Weng and Zhang tested the use of reconnaissance data in real time with 11 storms.For 2008 through 2012, the team found that airborne reconnaissance data reduced forecast errors by more than 10 percent for both wind speed and sea level pressure, two major components of a hurricane's intensity. In 2013, the Penn State model reduced forecast errors for wind speed and sea level pressure by between 5 and 15 percent, compared to existing models.\"In our study, we have demonstrated the benefit of integrating or incorporating reconnaissance data at an early stage into high-resolution weather prediction models through advanced data assimilation,\" said Zhang. \"Improving forecasts even 5 to 15 percent could translate to billions of dollars in savings, and this also could help agencies provide more notice to people if they are in the path of a storm.\"This is the third major hurricane prediction model improvement Zhang's team has investigated in recent years that has been transitioning to practice. They also showed that an ensemble-based approach, in which many variations of models are run to show uncertainty of predictions, and the use of on-plane Doppler improves forecasts, could improve predictions.The team is now investigating whether better use of satellite data can further improve hurricane predictions.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the National Science Foundation, the Office of Naval Research and NASA supported this work."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_199", "content": "Previous research from Duke environmental engineer Ana Barros demonstrated that the regular landfall of tropical cyclones is vital to the region's water supply and can help mitigate droughts.Now, a new study from Barros reveals that the increase in forest photosynthesis and growth made possible by tropical cyclones in the southeastern United States captures hundreds of times more carbon than is released by all vehicles in the U.S. in a given year.The study was published online on April 20, 2016, in the \"Our results show that, while hurricanes can cause flooding and destroy city infrastructure, there are two sides to the story,\" said Barros, the James L. Meriam Professor of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Duke University. \"The other side is that hurricanes recharge the aquifers and have an enormous impact on photosynthesis and taking up carbon from the atmosphere.\"In the study, Lauren Lowman, a doctoral student in Barros's laboratory, used a hydrological computer model to simulate the ecological impacts of tropical cyclones from 2004-2007. The earlier years of that time period had a high number of tropical cyclone landfall events, while the latter years experienced relatively few.By comparing those disparate years to simulations of a year without tropical cyclone events, Lowman was able to calculate the effect tropical cyclones have on the rates of photosynthesis and carbon uptake in forests of the southeastern United States.\"It's easy to make general statements about how much of an impact something like additional rainfall can have on the environment,\" said Lowman. \"But we really wanted to quantify the amount of carbon uptake that you can relate to tropical cyclones.\"According to Barros and Lowman, it is difficult to predict what effects climate change will have on the region's future. Even if the number of tropical cyclones that form in the Atlantic increases, that doesn't guarantee that the number making landfall will also rise. And long-term forecasts for the region's temperature and rainfall currently show less change than normal year-to-year variability.But no matter what the future brings, one thing is clear -- the regularity and number of tropical cyclones making landfall will continue to be vital.\"There are a lot of regional effects competing with large worldwide changes that make it very hard to predict what climate change will bring to the southeastern United States,\" said Barros. \"If droughts do become worse and we don't have these regular tropical cyclones, the impact will be very negative. And regardless of climate change, our results are yet one more very good reason to protect these vast forests.\"This research was funded in part by the National Science Foundation Coupled Human and Natural Systems Program (CNH-1313799) and an earlier grant from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NA08OAR4310701)."}

Coleman, center director, worked closely with the National Transportation Safety Board and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution to install telepresence technology on the research vessel Atlantis, the Woods Hole ship that conducted the search.\"Finding an object about the size of a basketball almost 3 miles under the surface of the sea is a remarkable achievement,\" said NTSB Chairman Christopher A. Hart. \"It would not have been possible without the information gained during the first survey of the wreckage and the equipment and support provided by Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, the National Science Foundation, the U.S. Coast Guard, the U.S. Navy, the University of Rhode Island, and the many other partners involved in this effort.\"Coleman said URI's \"cutting-edge telepresence technology helped provide critical clues to investigators to determine why the El Faro sank. There's some mystery as to what happened, so finding the voyage data recorder could reveal key details about the critical moments before the sinking.''The 790-foot cargo ship, loaded with shipping containers and cars, sank Oct. 31 during Hurricane Joaquin on its way from Jacksonville, Fla., to San Juan, Puerto Rico. All 33 crew members died, making it one of the worst disasters involving an American cargo vessel in decades.The ship was found a month later in about 15,000 feet of water, but the voyage data recorder -- a \"black box\" type device -- that could provide clues was never located.So far, video has shown that the two upper decks, including the navigation bridge, had separated from the El Faro's hull and were about a half mile away on the ocean floor.On April 16 and 17, Coleman installed ship-to-shore telecommunications equipment on the Atlantis, and he supervised an upgrade to the ship's satellite-tracking antenna to allow high-definition video broadcasts to stream ashore.He also helped install telecommunications equipment at NTSB's headquarters in Washington, D.C. to receive the broadcasts and enable two-way communication.\"My efforts allowed NTSB investigators and other experts on shore to participate in the day-to-day search activities and identify the voyage data recorder on the seafloor,\" he said.The data recorder is crucial to the investigation: It should have recorded audio from the bridge and information about the ship's speed and course.Woods Hole, partnering with NTSB, searched a 13.5-square-mile debris area in the Atlantic Ocean for the last few days or so. The team used an autonomous underwater vehicle -- known as Sentry -- to collect sonar data and high-resolution photographs of the debris.URI's telepresence technology provides a better way to transfer the images to on-shore investigators who can identify objects for recovery or closer inspection.\"We hope our technology can be used in future investigations -- other shipping accidents or plane disappearances in the ocean,\" said Coleman. \"We hope to use the technology to accelerate search and recovery operations and make them more affordable.

It's modeled after Mission Control at the Johnson Space Center in Houston.\"What we do at our center is similar to what NASA does to communicate with astronauts in space,\" said Coleman. \"Thanks to satellites and advanced Internet technologies, we can interact with scientists live onboard and participate in decision making in real time.\"The center -- the only one of its kind in the world for ocean research -- routinely supports the research missions of the R/V Endeavor, a URI research vessel, the missions of the exploration vessel Nautilus -- Robert Ballard's research ship -- and the Okeanos Explorer, which is based at Quonset Point, R.I., and owned and operated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_201", "content": "The report, \"The Impacts of Climate Change on Human Health in the United States: A Scientific Assessment,\" was developed by the U.S. Global Change Research Program, and outlines the impacts climate change has on human health, including mental health and well-being. Contributing to this report and its findings, were doctors from the Center for the Study of Traumatic Stress at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USU), to include the center's director and chair of the USU Department of Psychiatry, Dr. Robert J. Ursano, and assistant chair of the USU Department of Psychiatry, U.S. Public Health Service Cmdr. (Dr.) Joshua Morganstein.The threat of climate change has been found to be a key psychological and emotional stressor, and consequences can range from minimal stress and distress to clinical disorders, such as anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress, and suicidal thoughts, according to the report.Messages from the media as well as public communication about climate change, can affect perceptions of physical and societal risks, consequently affecting mental health and well-being, for example. An estimated 40 percent of Americans report hearing about climate change in the media at least once a month, and about half of Americans reported being worried about climate change in 2015, according to a survey, the report states. In more extreme cases, such as natural disasters causing injuries and deaths, damaged homes and communities, individuals may experience post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety disorders, grief, and depression. All of these reactions have the potential to interfere with the individual's functioning and well-being, according to the report. The majority of affected people recover over time, although some will develop chronic psychological problems, according to the report. Among those most at risk for poor mental health outcomes are some groups previously shown to suffer high rates of disaster related psychological problems including farmers, immigrants, those with limited mobility, those living in coastal areas, those from Indigenous communities or tribes, and veterans.Following exposure to Hurricane Katrina, veterans with pre-existing mental illness were at an almost 7 times greater risk for developing any additional mental illness, compared to those veterans without a pre-existing mental illness. Following hurricanes, increased levels of PTSD have been experienced by individuals who report less community support and help from neighbors and others.Overall, the report continues, those who have been directly affected by a climate- or weather-related disaster are at increased incidence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Increases in both suicidal thoughts (from 2.8% to 6.4%) and actual suicidal plans (from 1.0% to 2.5%) were observed in residents 18 months after Hurricane Katrina. Following Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, a study of internally displaced women living in temporary housing found reported rates of suicide attempt and completion to be 78.6 times and 14.7 times the regional average, respectively.Emerging evidence also shows those who are actively involved in climate change adaptation, or mitigation, might experience considerable health and well-being benefits, the report adds. These multiple psychological and environmental benefits do not necessarily minimize distress; however, when people do have distress related to relevant media exposure, or to thinking about climate change, taking action to address the issue can buffer against distress, the report states. Such engagement both addresses the threat and helps manage the emotional responses as people come to terms with -- and adjust their understandings and lives in the context of -- climate change."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_202", "content": "\"For decades, geostationary satellites such as the GOES series have been the primary tool to monitor severe weather like storms and hurricanes in real time,\" said Fuqing Zhang, professor of meteorology and director of Penn State's Center for Advanced Data Assimilation and Predictability Techniques. \"They have helped people see what's going on in the present, but, until now, we as a community have not been able to tap into these resources to guide us to predict future severe weather.\"Geostationary satellites like the GOES series orbit the Earth at a fixed location, taking snapshots of cloud formations and other meteorological information. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration operates GOES with contributions from NASA.Historically, two main challenges exist when using satellite data for hurricane predictions -- the type and amount of data collected. Satellites do not directly measure many quantities related to a hurricane's intensity, such as surface pressure, wind speeds, temperature and water vapor beneath the cloudy regions of the hurricane eyewall. They do, however, collect data known as brightness temperature, which show how much radiation is emitted by objects on Earth and in the atmosphere at different infrared frequencies. Because all objects naturally emit and absorb different amounts of radiation at different frequencies, the complexity of data poses challenges to researchers hoping to use these data for hurricane prediction models.\"At some frequencies water vapor absorbs moderate amounts of radiation passing through it, at other frequencies it absorbs most of that radiation and at other frequencies it absorbs hardly any at all. Unlike water vapor, clouds strongly absorb radiation at all of these frequencies,\" said Eugene Clothiaux, professor of meteorology. \"Comparing measurements at different frequencies leads to information about water vapor and clouds at different altitudes above the Earth. This begins to tell us about the physical structure of water vapor fields and clouds, including those in the area around a hurricane.\"Using brightness temperature satellite data to improve model forecasts of hurricanes is not straightforward. Brightness temperature information is a complex mixture related to the ground, atmospheric water vapor and clouds. The team had to develop a sophisticated analysis and modeling scheme to extract information in useful ways for model forecasts.Zhang, Masashi Minamide, graduate student in meteorology, and Clothiaux demonstrated in a pilot study that it is becoming feasible to use brightness data. They found definitive correlations between measurements of brightness temperature and information about the storm -- wind speed and sea level pressure underneath the hurricane. They report their results in the current issue of Using data from GOES-13, the team completed a proof-of-concept experiment, analyzing data from Hurricane Karl in 2010. They used the Penn State real-time hurricane analysis and prediction system that Zhang and his team have been developing and refining for nearly a decade.\"Hurricane prediction models work by chunking individual blocks of the hurricane and this starts from the initial information that is fed into the model,\" said Zhang. \"We then run an ensemble of possible outcomes for the hurricane using different variables to estimate uncertainty and this tells us how the hurricane might behave. If we are able to use a higher resolution for the initial state, this could allow us to vastly improve hurricane predictions in the future.\"GOES-13 provides data at a resolution of 2.5 miles, and GOES-R will increase that to under 0.6 miles for some frequencies of brightness temperature. The increase in resolution is especially important because of the size of hurricanes. The eyewall, the layer of clouds surrounding the eye, varies in size but is roughly 6 miles thick. Using GOES-13 brightness temperatures with 2.5-mile resolution, the eyewall is often grouped together with other parts of the storm, with only one or two brightness temperature measurements from only the eyewall itself. A 0.6 mile resolution brightness temperature measurement would allow for up to 10 eyewall measurements to be fed into prediction models as separate chunks of information instead of grouped together with other parts of the storm.This new data source could have implications on the longstanding challenge of predicting hurricane intensity, Zhang said. Researchers know that wind speed and other levels of activity near the eye of the hurricane are linked to future intensity, but actually collecting these data is difficult. Today, NOAA uses airborne reconnaissance to collect data, but this is only possible when the storm is within flying distance. Satellites that constantly monitor the oceans at high spatial and temporal resolution and with many frequencies of brightness temperature, like GOES-R, could remove that constraint.\"Geostationary satellites are there all the time, which makes them ideal for capturing the initial and evolving states of hurricanes, including the crucial information in the cloudy region of the storm,\" said Zhang. \"Using satellite data more effectively could potentially revolutionize hurricane monitoring and prediction for many years.\""}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_203", "content": "\"In the past, many scientists have been cautious of attributing specific extreme weather events to climate change. People frequently ask questions such as, 'Did climate change cause Hurricane Sandy?' Science can't answer that because there are so many relevant factors for hurricanes. What this report is saying is that we can attribute an increased magnitude or frequency of some extreme weather events to climate change,\" said David Titley, professor of practice in Penn State's Department of Meteorology and founding director of Penn State's Center for Solutions to Weather and Climate Risk, who chaired the committee that wrote the report.The committee found that scientists can now confidently attribute some heat waves and cold events, and to a lesser degree droughts and extreme rainfall, to human-caused climate change. Even a decade ago, many scientists argued that research could not confidently tie any specific weather events to climate change, which the committee reports today is no longer true today.\"If we can actually understand how and why frequencies or magnitudes change of extreme events are changing, those are two components of risk. Understanding that risk is crucial for governments and businesses. For example, if you're managing a business, you may need to know whether there may be more droughts in the future because that may impact supply chain logistics and, ultimately, your bottom dollar,\" said Titley.Scientific confidence for attributing extreme weather events is a three-legged stool, said Titley. To confidently link specific weather events to climate change, researchers need an understanding of the underlying physical causes of weather events, enough observational data to place a specific event within a historical context and the ability to replicate an event with computer models. For example, when examining hurricanes and typhoons, the lack of a high-quality, long-term historical record, uncertainty regarding the impact of climate change on storm frequency and inability to accurately simulate these storms in most global climate models raises significant challenges when attributing assessing the impact of climate change on any single storm.Attributing the cause of extreme weather to climate change or other factors can \"enhance scientists' ability to accurately predict and project future weather and climatic states,\" said Titley. Predicting both the frequency and intensity of extreme events -- those that are rare in a location -- could allow society to lessen their impact and potentially avoid loss of life and destruction.The committee identified research priorities to further enhance the scientific community's ability to attribute specific extreme weather events to climate change. In addition to endorsing action on relevant items outlined by the World Climate Research Programme in 2014, the report recommends developing transparent community standards for attributing classes of extreme events, and formulating systematic criteria for selecting events to be studied. The committee also recommends that some future event attribution activities could be incorporated into an integrated weather-to-climate forecasting efforts on a broad range of timescales, with an ultimate goal of providing predictive risk-based forecasts of extreme events at lead times of days to seasons.The report can be accessed at:"}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_204", "content": "The study's findings could help reduce the uncertainty in hurricane intensity forecasts for hurricanes and typhoons that cross coastal ocean waters before striking populated shorelines.Hurricane track forecasts have steadily improved over the last two decades, but improvements in hurricane intensity forecasts have lagged.\"This is a missing piece required to close the intensity gap for land-falling mid-Atlantic hurricanes in summer,\" said Greg Seroka, a study coauthor and doctoral candidate in Rutgers' Department of Marine and Coastal Sciences.The study, published online in \"We used IOOS to assemble an unprecedented view of a land-falling hurricane during the highly stratified summer season. We discovered new processes responsible for rapid ocean cooling that reduce storm intensities,\" said Scott Glenn, the study's lead author and a professor at Rutgers.Stratification is when the ocean is divided into a warm surface water layer and a cold bottom layer in summer.While accurate forecasts of Irene's track provided time for preparations and coastal evacuations, the top wind speeds in Irene's official forecasts along the mid-Atlantic coast were too high. Uncertainties in intensity forecasts can lead to unnecessary preparation costs, future public skepticism about storm warnings, and other impacts.Many people did not immediately heed the warnings for Hurricane Sandy in 2012 because Irene wasn't as bad as forecast. Irene weakened to tropical storm strength just before it hit New Jersey.Incorporating coastal ocean water conditions in forecasts of storm intensity and impacts will be increasingly critical in the Earth's mid-latitude areas as sea levels rise and peak tropical cyclone intensities migrate toward the poles, according to the study.Rutgers researchers launched the study as Hurricane Irene cruised up the East Coast in late August 2011. They collected data via satellite, radar, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration offshore buoys and a Slocum autonomous underwater glider located about 12 miles southeast of Atlantic City, New Jersey.They found that Irene's winds mixed the coastal ocean's warm surface layer and cold bottom layer, causing rapid cooling ahead of Irene's eye.\"The mid-Atlantic's extensive network of surface current mapping radars indicated that the strong winds on the leading edge of the storm set up the circulation pattern that cooled the ocean surface,\" said Rutgers' Hugh Roarty, study coauthor and regional coordinator for the radar network.\"Then the ocean and atmospheric models confirmed the forcing mechanisms for the cooling process and its impact on the storm,\" said Travis Miles, assistant research professor at Rutgers and study coauthor.\"Satellite imagery from before and after the storm revealed that the ocean surface cooled up to 11 degrees Celsius, or 20 degrees Fahrenheit,\" said Oscar Schofield, a Rutgers professor and study coauthor.Josh Kohut, another coauthor and Rutgers associate professor, leads a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and N.J. Department of Environmental Protection marine water monitoring program that helped make the discovery. \"A U.S. EPA- and N.J. DEP-funded underwater glider demonstrated that most of the cooling took place ahead of Irene's eye,\" he said.Robert Forney, a Rutgers undergraduate who participated in the study, said the researchers subsequently \"examined the 30-year historical record and found that the cooling occurred in every hurricane that crossed the mid-Atlantic coastal waters in summer.\"That included 11 storms from 1985 to 2015.\"We then looked at typhoons in Asia, and found extensive cooling occurred in Super Typhoon Muifa as it crossed the Yellow Sea\" in 2011, said Yi Xu, a study coauthor who earned a Ph.D. at Rutgers and is now a researcher at East China Normal University in Shanghai, China.Another coauthor is Fei Yu of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Qingdao, China, who used buoy data to confirm the rapid cooling ahead of Muifa's eye.The study was funded by the NOAA-led U.S. Integrated Ocean Observing System through the Mid-Atlantic Regional Association Coastal Ocean Observing System, the NOAA Cooperative Institute for the North Atlantic Region through the Disaster Recovery Act, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the N.J.

Learning more about how hurricanes correlated with climate for the past 500 years may lead to better regional predictions of hurricanes.\"We're providing information that can help those models become more precise,\" she said.What is now the U.S. National Hurricane Center did not begin keeping records of Caribbean hurricanes until 1850, she said. Researchers have used lake sediments to develop a record of hurricanes over the past centuries, but these data provide only century-level resolution.The new research provides an annual record of Caribbean hurricanes going back to the year 1500 -- shortly after Christopher Columbus first reached the Caribbean.Ship traffic between Spain and the Caribbean became commonplace. Spain kept detailed records of the comings and goings of ships--at the time, ships returning with gold and other goods provided the income for the Spanish kingdom. Storms were the major reason that ships wrecked in the Caribbean.Figuring out how climate change affects hurricane activity is important for emergency management planning. For U.S. hurricanes from 1970 to 2002, other investigators estimated the damages cost $57 billion in 2015 dollars.The team's paper, \"Shipwreck Rates Reveal Caribbean Tropical Cyclone Response to Past Radiative Forcing,\" is scheduled to be published online by the Trouet's co-authors are Grant Harley of the University of Southern Mississippi in Hattiesburg and Marta DomÃ­nguez-DelmÃ¡s of the University of Santiago de Compostela in Lugo, Spain.The University of Southern Mississippi, the National Science Foundation, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and an Agnese N. Haury Visiting Scholar Fellowship supported the research.Trouet and her coauthors hatched the idea for the study while sitting on the patio of Tucson's Hotel Congress. The three scientists were attending the Second American Dendrochronology Conference, which was held in Tucson in 2013.Harley mentioned he had tree-ring records from the Florida Keys that went back to 1707 -- and that the tree rings revealed when hurricanes had occurred. The growth of trees is retarded in years with hurricanes. That reduction in growth is reflected in the tree's annual rings.DomÃ­nguez-DelmÃ¡s, a dendroarchaelogist, figures out when Spanish ships were built by retrieving wood from shipwrecks and dating the wood. Trouet wondered whether the tree-ring record of Florida hurricanes could be combined with shipwreck data to create a long-term history of Caribbean hurricanes.The team discovered that a book used by treasure hunters, Robert F. Marx's book \"Shipwrecks in the Americas: a complete guide to every major shipwreck in the Western Hemisphere,\" had a detailed record of Caribbean shipwrecks. The team also used \"Shipwrecks of Florida: A comprehensive listing,\" by Steven D. Singer.The books, combined with ship logs, allowed the researchers to compile a list of Spanish ships known to have been wrecked by storms during the hurricane seasons of 1495-1825. The team found that the hurricane patterns from the shipwreck database closely matched Florida Keys tree-ring chronology of hurricanes from 1707-1825.In addition, the team compared the Florida Keys tree-ring records to the systematic recordings of hurricanes from 1850-2009. Again, the patterns matched.When they overlapped the shipwreck data with the tree-ring data, the researchers discovered a 75 percent reduction in hurricane activity from 1645-1715, a time period known as the Maunder Minimum.\"We didn't go looking for the Maunder Minimum,\" Trouet said. \"It just popped out of the data.\"The Maunder Minimum is so named because there was a low in sunspot activity during that time. Because Earth receives less solar radiation during lulls in sunspot activity, the Northern Hemisphere was cooler during the Maunder Minimum than in the time periods before or after.Learning that a lull in Caribbean hurricanes corresponded to a time when Earth received less solar energy will help researchers better understand the influence of large changes in radiation, including that from greenhouse gas emissions, on hurricane activity.Having better predictions about how anthropogenic climate change affects hurricane activity is important because hurricanes are so destructive and have big societal impacts, Trouet said. She anticipates the new findings will help improve future hurricane predictions under a changing climate."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_206", "content": "Woodruff and first author Brandon, with colleagues at Stevens Institute of Technology and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute, used a new approach based on sediment reconstructions from coastal ponds and hydrodynamic model simulations to show that the initial degradation of oyster reefs in the harbor following European settlement coincides with \"a significant increase in wave-derived overwash deposition\" at all of their field sites. Details appear in an early online issue of Woodruff says, \"We initially set out to investigate what Hurricane Sandy's resultant sand deposit looked like in coastal ponds on Staten Island, a location in outer New York Harbor that is occasionally exposed to ocean swells. These sites were flooded severely during the event and we were curious how this \"Sandy\" deposit compared to sediments deposited by earlier flood events. An event layer from Hurricane Sandy was clearly present at all our sites, as well as older storm deposits that dated to historical floods.\" An event layer is a tell-tale sign in sediment, in the case of Sandy a red layer of denser, coarse-grained sediment associated with storm overwash.He adds, \"However, prior to between 1600 and 1800 these storm deposits went away. If it were just one site it would have been one thing, but at every site we saw the same: no storm deposits for thousands of years before European settlement and then after colonization, storm waves start to become more and more effective in transporting sand inland to our field sites. Something the early colonists did seemed to increase storm-induced overwash at the study sites. The million dollar question was what.\"At first the authors thought the answer might be sea-level rise, variability in storm activity or land clearing, but when reviewed in detail none of these explanations was consistent with observations, Woodruff notes. \"We kept reaching dead ends until we considered one of the largest impacts European settlers had on New York Harbor, the decimation of its natural oyster beds.\"These beds were one of the most notable features of New York Harbor when Europeans arrived, covering as much as 220,000 acres of the Hudson and Raritan Rivers' estuary. Oysters were a staple of early colonial diets, and an important lime source for farm fields and construction mortar, the geoscientist says. Between 1600 and 1800, the New York oyster beds were rapidly over-harvested by hand and from dredges towed by sloops and schooners. The authors hypothesize that the reefs had absorbed a significant fraction of storm-wave energy before they were destroyed.To test this hypothesis, co-author Philip Orton at Stevens used a circulation and wave simulation model to reconstruct past wave heights and storm surge elevations, and to model the effects of oyster beds on wave heights in two historic storms, Sandy in 2012 and a severe 1992 winter storm. Woodruff and colleagues also collected core sediment samples from 5 to 6.5 meters (about 16 to 21 feet) deep, going back about 3,000 years, to analyze storm layers and other features.Simulations for the two storms included a control case without oyster beds, as well as with oyster beds at locations roughly corresponding to those historically documented in New York's outer harbor. The authors conclude from this modeling that \"sensitivity to reef height is strong.\" For example, in the control with no oyster bed present, the 1992 storm model showed as much as a 200 percent increase in wave energy when compared to the oyster reef cases. Thus, they say, \"reefs provided significant coastal protection from waves prior to their disturbance between 1600 and 1800.\"They acknowledge, \"As with any sedimentary record, there will always be a certain level of uncertainty related to its interpretation.\" However, numerical modeling shows that the overharvesting and destruction of oyster reefs \"provides a reasonable explanation for the increase in storm-induced overwash observed at our study sites.\"The study showed that this area of New York Harbor is now experiencing between about 30 percent and 200 percent higher wave energy from extreme storms than in the distant past. \"This translates into increased vulnerability of the area to storms: a result most likely shared by other coastal areas that have lost their natural oyster beds,\" Woodruff and colleagues note."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_207", "content": "A new study led by the University of Maryland's Earth System Science Interdisciplinary Center (ESSIC) suggests that a warmer Atlantic Ocean could substantially boost the destructive power of a future superstorm like Sandy. The researchers used a numerical model to simulate the weather patterns that created Sandy, with one key difference: a much warmer sea surface temperature, as would be expected in a world with twice as much carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. This simulated warmer ocean generated storms that were 50 to 160 percent more destructive than Sandy. The results appear online January 19, 2016 in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.\"This kind of experiment is not necessarily a realistic simulation, but it is along a similar path that the future climate might expect to evolve,\" said William Lau, a research scientist at ESSIC and senior scientist emeritus at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. Lau added that sea surface temperatures could reach such elevated levels within the next 50 to 100 years.In the model scenarios, the pool of warm water (greater than 82 degrees Fahrenheit) in the tropical Atlantic grew to twice its actual size. The larger warm pool gave the simulated hurricanes more time to grow before they encountered colder water or land.In the five simulations conducted by Lau and his colleagues at NASA Goddard, two hurricanes followed the same track as Sandy, hooking westward and merging with the mid-latitude storm as they hit the coast. Because of their longer exposure to the large warm pool, their winds had 50 to 80 percent more destructive power, and they brought 30 to 50 percent more heavy rain.\"We expected the storm would definitely get stronger because of much warmer sea surface temperature,\" Lau said.Each of the other three hurricanes followed a surprising and even more destructive course. In these simulations, the hurricane grew so strong that it followed a different track and didn't collide with the mid-latitude storm. Instead, the hurricane went farther east into the open ocean before turning westward. Next, the hurricane and the mid-latitude storm rotated counterclockwise around their combined center of mass--a phenomenon known as the Fujiwhara effect. As the mid-latitude storm rotated east, the Sandy-like storm gained strength from the Fujiwhara effect and swung westward, making landfall between Maine and Nova Scotia.\"These events are somewhat rare in occurrence, but they do exist in nature,\" Lau said. \"While they're turning about each other, they interact. One just took the energy from the other.\"As a result, the three Fujiwhara-enhanced hurricanes' destructive power peaked at 100 to 160 percent higher than Sandy, and brought as much as 180 percent more rain. And while they made landfall farther north, Lau said, their impacts could be farther-reaching and more devastating than Sandy.\"Because the size of the storm is so large, it could affect the entire Atlantic coast, not just where it makes landfall,\" he predicted. \"The rainfall itself is probably way out in the ocean, but the storm surge would be catastrophic.\"Lau said the usual approach to simulating a storm in a warmer climate would be to impose a prescribed sea surface temperature, and then adjust the atmospheric conditions such as air temperature, moisture and winds. The model would then be run many times, making adjustments each time in hopes of creating a Sandy-like storm. But this approach is tedious and does not guarantee meaningful results, Lau explained.\"When confronted with the question whether or not global warming contributed to Sandy, many scientists would just throw their hands up and say, 'We cannot address the question of how hurricanes will behave in a future climate because the myriad factors affecting storm behaviors are too complex and impossible to simulate',\" Lau said. \"This is the first time it was done by using known atmospheric initial conditions that gave rise to Sandy, and simply changing one important variable--in this case, the ocean temperature.\"By using this approach, Lau and colleagues created an informative--if only plausible--scenario that could help to understand how storms might behave in a future warmer climate.Lau noted that Sandy was most likely a \"perfect storm\" brought about by a series of improbable coincidences. As such, it's hard to make any definite conclusions about whether and how global warming contributed to Sandy and other recent destructive storms, he said.\"However, studies like ours can help provide informative answers to the more tractable question of how a perfect storm like Sandy would behave under warmer ocean temperatures,\" Lau said. \"It's a very important line of investigation for better understanding the future of our planet.\""}

Eight hours later at 1200 UTC (7 a.m. EST) strongest sustained winds shifted east of center and increased to near 30 mps (67.1 mph/108 kph), making them tropical-storm force.Later in the day at 2100 UTC (4 p.m. EST) satellite images indicated that the low pressure system developed into a subtropical storm and was named Alex. At the time, Alex was located near 27.1 degrees north latitude and 30.8 degrees west longitude, about 782 miles (1,260 km) south-southwest of the Azores.By 1500 UTC (10 a.m. EST) on January 14, hurricane force winds extended outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from the center and tropical storm force winds extend outward up to 150 miles (240 km).An animation of GOES-East satellite visible and infrared imagery from Jan. 10 to 14 showed the development of Hurricane Alex in the Central Atlantic Ocean.

The animation showed the sub-tropical low pressure area consolidate quickly on Jan. 13 and reach hurricane status on Jan. 14, 2016.The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer or MODIS instrument that flies aboard NASA's Aqua satellite captured a visible image of Hurricane Alex on Jan. 14 at 15:30 UTC (10:30 a.m. EST) in the central Atlantic Ocean. The image revealed an eye and showed bands of thunderstorms spiraling into the low level center of circulation.According to the National Hurricane Center, Alex is the first hurricane to form in the month of January since 1938. Alex is also the first North Atlantic hurricane thriving in January since Alice of 1955, which formed on Dec. 30, 1954. Alice developed on December 30, 1954 from a trough of low pressure in the central Atlantic Ocean in an area of unusually favorable conditions.The Azores Meteorological Service has issued a Hurricane Warning for the islands of Faial, Pico, Sao Jorge, Graciosa, and Terceira in the central Azores, and a Tropical Storm Warning for the islands of Sao Miguel and Santa Maria in the eastern Azores.

Alex was moving toward the north-northeast near 20 mph (31 kph) and a turn toward the north with an increase in forward speed is expected over the next day or two. On the forecast track, the center of Alex will move near or over portions of the Azores Friday morning, Jan. 15.Maximum sustained winds are near 85 mph (140 kph) with higher gusts. Little change in strength is forecast through Friday. The estimated minimum central pressure is 981 millibars.NHC's Forecaster Pasch said \"Remarkably, Alex has undergone the transformation into a hurricane. A distinct eye is present, embedded within a fairly symmetric mass of deep convection. It is very unusual to have a hurricane over waters that are near 20 degrees Celsius, but the upper-tropospheric temperatures are estimated to be around -60 degrees Celsius, which is significantly colder than the tropical mean. The resulting instability is likely the main factor contributing to the tropical transition and intensification of Alex.\"Alex is expected to maintain hurricane status on Friday, Jan. 15 and transition into an extra-tropical storm by Jan. 16 as it continues to move north toward Greenland.For updates on Alex, visit NOAA's NHC website:"}

{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_210", "content": "\"Island nations in the western Pacific region are subjected to more tropical cyclones than anywhere else worldwide,\" said Thomas Marler, ecologist with the University of Guam. \"And the greatest destructive forces of tropical cyclones occurs on coastal zone habitats.\"Working out of the Western Pacific Tropical Research Center, Marler teamed up with Ulysses Ferreras, a biologist with the Philippine Native Plants Conservation Society. The research partnership attempted to more fully understand the destructive forces of the typhoon by looking at the influence on chemical cycling among the interacting biological and geological systems. Their research focused on several islands in the eastern Visayan region of the Philippines where the typhoon first made landfall on 8 November 2013.\"We had conducted a lot of field work in these habitats during the years prior to the tropical cyclone,\" said Marler, \"so we were able to return to those same habitats in attempts to understand the damage.\" The study included several habitats that contained different soil traits but supported a common plant species, The publication illuminates several ways in which a tropical cyclone disrupts nutrient flow through the ecosystem. For example, defoliation of green leaves may be one of the most common responses of forests to tropical cyclone damage. Because these leaves were unable to proceed through the normal aging process before being dislodged from the trees, nutritional status of the plants temporarily decreases and forest floor nutritional deposits temporarily increase. Additionally, many plant leaves were partially desiccated by cyclone-force winds, but not fully killed. In response, nutrients were locked up in the damaged portions of these leaves forcing them to stay suspended in tree canopies for extended periods of time instead of falling with customary litterfall to enter the soil nutrient cycling process.Tropical cyclones are called typhoons in the western Pacific and hurricanes in the Atlantic basin. They are an example of what ecologists consider infrequent, large-scale disturbances. The ecosystem responses to the damage may be altered for many years following the disturbance event that may last only a few hours. This case study provides a relevant example of these phenomena from the heavily impacted but seldom studied Philippine islands."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_211", "content": "These coastal wetlands are in retreat in many locations around the globe--raising deep concerns about damage to the wildlife that the marshes nourish and the loss of their ability to protect against violent storms. The biggest cause of their erosion is waves driven by moderate storms, not occasional major events such as Hurricane Sandy, researchers from Boston University and the United States Geological Survey now have shown.\"Waves are very powerful because they attack the marsh in its weakest part,\" says Nicoletta Leonardi, a Ph.D. candidate at BU's Department of Earth & Environment and lead author on a paper published in the journal Analyzing eight salt marsh locations in Australia, Italy and the United States, \"we found that the behavior of salt marshes is very predictable,\" says Leonardi, with a constant relationship between wave energy and the speed of marsh erosion.In fact, the work shows that hurricanes and other violent storms contribute less than 1 percent of salt marsh deterioration in those marshes, says Sergio Fagherazzi, BU Earth & Environment associate professor and co-author on the paper.Along the New England coast, for example, the moderate northeast storms that may hit every few months strip away far more from the marshes than the hurricanes that may sweep through a few times a decade. \"Salt marshes survive for thousands of years, which means they know how to cope against hurricane waves,\" he says.In a major storm, \"beaches or dunes on a beach just collapse all at once,\" Fagherazzi adds. \"Marshes don't, which is a major advantage if you are serious about using them for hazard mitigation and coast protection.\"\"While hurricanes are catastrophic events, the salt marsh doesn't respond catastrophically,\" says Neil Kamal Ganju, a co-author and research oceanographer with USGS in Woods Hole, Massachusetts. In addition to the infrequency of hurricanes, that may be because a hurricane's surge brings up water level so high over a marsh that waves have relatively little effect, he suggests.Improved knowledge about salt marsh erosion brings an important new tool to those responsible for management and restoration of wetlands. \"You can take the geography of a salt marsh and the estuary around it, and if you understand the wind climate and the wave climate, using historical data, you now can predict the marsh erosion,\" says Ganju.Globally, salt marshes are being lost to waves, changes in land use, higher sea levels, loss of sediment from upstream dams and other factors. This puts at risk \"a lot of ecosystem services that we need to preserve,\" Leonardi emphasizes. Many initiatives around the world now seek to protect and rebuild salt marshes. Evidence also suggests that, at least in some coastal environments, marshes can adapt to rising sea levels.In the United States, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and many cities want to manage salt marshes as \"living shorelines\" that act as buffers between coastal communities and the ocean, Fagherazzi says. Such efforts kicked off in New Jersey and New York after Hurricane Sandy in 2012, and around New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina in 2005.The effect of waves on salt marsh erosion, part of a USGS project to examine the response of estuaries to Hurricane Sandy, is being integrated into a USGS numerical model called COAWST (Coupled-Ocean-Atmosphere-Wave-Sediment Transport). COAWST combines models of ocean, atmosphere, waves and sediment transport for analysis of coastal change.Better understanding of marsh erosion also may help in modeling carbon storage as it relates to climate change, the scientists say."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_212", "content": "This study, which is a first of a kind, found that the political culture of a given city could affect how well city officials moved to prepare for extreme weather.\"Tampa is vulnerable to climate change and associated extreme weather,\" says lead author Sabrina McCormick, PhD, an associate professor of environmental and occupational health at Milken Institute SPH. \"Despite this risk, Florida's political representatives remain largely unconcerned about climate change.\" Without the political will or public education, city decision-makers interviewed said that Tampa was one of the least prepared cities in the nation. McCormick notes that more than 125,000 residents of the Tampa area live below the flood line and would face great danger during the next big hurricane that hits the Tampa coastline.The study is the first to look at societal factors, such as the political environment, and how they affect a city's ability to act on climate change. \"This research is critical to moving cities forward in addressing climate impacts so that economic risk can be reduced and human health can be protected,\" McCormick and her co-author report. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and others, climate change will lead to a number of human health threats that range from premature death or injuries caused by wildfires or hurricanes to post-traumatic stress disorder and other mental health issues triggered by natural disasters.McCormick interviewed sixty-five local decision makers in each of the six cities, finding there are three factors that play a role in how well city planners plan for or prepare for climate change. The study found swing factors, such as the risk of extreme weather, could motivate city officials or hamper them--often the outcome depended on the political culture in a given city.For example, Tampa has the highest risk for hurricanes in the United States, yet has a public and political climate that has impeded action on climate change. In contrast, Los Angeles faces a high risk of wildfires/heat waves due to rising temperatures. Unlike Tampa, politicians in Los Angeles acknowledge the high risk and have used it to take action. This study found that Los Angeles was in the middle of extensive planning for such disasters and had a well-developed emergency management system as a result.Second, scientific uncertainty and political opposition could affect the ability of a city to plan and prepare for climate change. For example, Portland, a city with many liberal politicians and public concern about climate change, had the most advanced plans of all of the cities in the study. Tucson, Tampa and Raleigh, cities that had more Conservative Democratics or Republicans, had many politicians who dismissed climate change and rarely made it part of their political platform.Finally, a city's ability to move aggressively on climate change also depends on a well-informed public and political engagement, the study found. \"For example, in Los Angeles and Portland, decision makers generally felt that a majority of the citizens accepted the existence of climate change, often pressuring politicians and decision makers to address it,\" McCormick says."}

It was co-authored by Jim Blackburn, a professor in the practice of environmental law at Rice and Baker Institute Rice Faculty Scholar; Regina Buono, the Baker Botts Fellow in Energy and Environmental Regulatory Affairs at the institute's Center for Energy Studies; and Larry Dunbar, project manager for Rice's Severe Storm Prediction, Education and Evacuation from Disasters Center (SSPEED).Past discussions of hurricane-protection options for the Houston-Galveston region have focused on constructing a floodgate at the mouth of either Galveston Bay or the Houston Ship Channel. In the latest analysis of options that federal, state and local officials might consider, SSPEED experts this summer issued a report offering a third alternative: a mid-bay gate halfway between the previously discussed sites.\"It is impossible to discuss mitigating these hurricane-surge damage issues without taking federal environmental law and policy into account, particularly if federal money is being relied upon, a point that seems to be missed by many local advocates,\" said Blackburn, who is co-director of SSPEED. \"At least two alternatives exist that offer substantial protection of industry and residences in the bay's high-risk zone, but the law and policies relate to each in different ways. The mid-bay alternative might be able to be funded with local and/or state monies, whereas the lower-bay alternative almost certainly will require federal money, thereby more directly invoking federal environmental laws and funding policies.\"The authors said the vulnerability of the U.S. coastline to severe storms is clear in wake of hurricanes Katrina, Sandy, Ike and Wilma, which collectively amounted to more than $200 billion in economic loss, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The Houston-Galveston region alone experienced more than $25 billion in economic loss from Hurricane Ike in 2008, despite the fact that the greatest impact missed the region and instead hit east of Galveston Bay, according to SSPEED.In the aftermath of Ike, SSPEED has been studying hurricane-surge damage reduction strategies under a grant from the Houston Endowment. The goal of this work is to develop and evaluate structural and nonstructural alternatives to create a plan capable of significantly reducing hurricane-surge damages in the region.Blackburn said that more generally, the goal of this paper is to discuss evolving federal flood-damage reduction policy and the increased importance and integration of ecological service features into project design. \"The paper presents the Texas Coastal Exchange, a nonstructural, ecological services-based flood-damage mitigation concept that has great potential not only for Galveston Bay but across the U.S.,\" he said. \"This ecological services orientation of the federal government has only recently emerged under the Obama administration and is a major refocusing of flood-damage reduction policy at the federal level. The creation of a market-based ecological services transaction system is an excellent way to integrate emerging federal policy creatively with market forces to achieve long-term surge protection as well as a response to sea-level rise, which is not emphasized in the paper.\"The research paper can be found at:Â"}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_214", "content": "\"For each of the past four years, this report has demonstrated that individual events, like temperature extremes, have often been shown to be linked to additional atmospheric greenhouse gases caused by human activities, while other extremes, such as those that are precipitation related, are less likely to be convincingly linked to human activities,\" said Thomas R. Karl, L.H.D., director of NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information. \"As the science of event attribution continues to advance, so too will our ability to detect and distinguish the effects of long-term climate change and natural variability on individual extreme events. Until this is fully realized, communities would be well-served to look beyond the range of past extreme events to guide future resiliency efforts.\"In this year's report, 32 groups of scientists from around the world investigate 28 individual extreme events in 2014 and break out various factors that led to the extreme events, including the degree to which natural variability and human-induced climate change played a role. When human influence for an event cannot be conclusively identified with the scientific tools available today, this means that if there is a human contribution, it cannot be distinguished from natural climate variability.The report this year added analysis on new types of events including wildfires and Antarctic sea ice extent, and in one case looked at how land use patterns may influence the impacts and severity from precipitation.Key findings for each of the assessed events include:\"Understanding our influence on specific extreme weather events is ground-breaking science that will help us adapt to climate change,\" said Stephanie C. Herring, Ph.D., lead editor for the report at NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information. \"As the field of climate attribution science grows, resource managers, the insurance industry, and many others can use the information more effectively for improved decision making and to help communities better prepare for future extreme events.\"Report:"}

Ault, UM Rosenstiel School professor of marine biology and ecology. \"This offers a powerful new approach to study how fish interact with dynamic water features relatively common in the ocean.\"Ocean heat content (OHC) relative to the 26Â°C isotherm, a measure of heat stored in the upper surface layers of the ocean, has been used for more than four decades by scientists to help predict hurricane intensity. Over the past two decades, OHC has been monitored daily using satellite fields and in-situ data that provide basin-scale variability for both weather and climate studies. In addition to providing the OHC for forecasting, these previous studies showed OHC images reveal dynamic ocean features, such as fronts and eddies, in the ocean better than just using standard techniques (e.g., sea surface temperature), especially during the summer months.The researchers compared data on fish movements obtained from pop-up satellite tags affixed to the highly migratory fish alongside maps of the heat stored in the upper ocean. \"Using an advanced optimization algorithm and OHC maps, we developed a method to greatly improve geolocation accuracy and refine fish movement tracks derived from satellite tags,\" said Jiangang Luo, lead author and UM scientist at the Tarpon and Bonefish Research Center. The analysis revealed that fish commonly swim along the boundaries of water features in the ocean, such as fronts, like the Florida and Loop Current and their complex eddy fields.\"Using the OHC approach in a new way offers an unprecedented view of how these animals move with currents and eddies in the ocean,\" said Nick Shay, UM Rosenstiel School professor of ocean sciences. \"Our study provides a more detailed picture of the ocean ecosystem as an entity.\"In one 109-day analysis, the researchers documented a yellowfin tuna move along a weak front off the Mississippi River before reaching an eddy centered in the Gulf of Mexico. In separate analysis, a yellowfin tuna swam around the periphery of the same eddy many times over a 20-day period, rarely passing over it.Eddies are swirling masses of water that have been shed from strong ocean current fronts, and pump nutrient-rich water to the surface. Fronts are a type of current created at a boundary between two distinct water masses with differing physical properties, such as different temperatures, salinities. In the Gulf of Mexico, warm eddies are often shed from the Loop Current in the summer months causing a rapid intensification of hurricanes (e.g., Katrina) as they pass over it.\"Our new method shows that hurricanes and highly migratory fish share at least one common oceanographic interest -- warm swirling ocean eddies,\" said Ault."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_216", "content": "For decades, research on climate variations in the Atlantic has focused almost exclusively on the role of ocean circulation as the main driver, specifically the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, which carries warm water north in the upper layers of the ocean and cold water south in lower layers like a large conveyor belt.\"The idea of the ocean as the driver has been a powerful one.\" said UM Rosenstiel School Professor Amy Clement, the lead author on the study. We used computer models in a new way to test this idea, and find that in fact there is a lot that can be explained without the ocean circulation.\"While the overall rise in average temperature of the Atlantic is caused by greenhouse gases, this study examines the fluctuations occurring within this human-related trend. Identifying the main driver of the AMO is critical to help predict the overall warming of the North Atlantic Ocean in coming decades from both natural and human-made climate change. Recent research suggests that an AMO warm phase has been in effect since the mid-1990s, which has caused changes in rainfall in the southeastern US, and resulted in twice as many tropical storms becoming hurricanes than during cool phases.Using multiple climate models from around the world, Clement's research team removed the ocean circulation from the analysis to reveal that variations in the Atlantic climate were generally the same. The AMO results in a horseshoe-shaped pattern of ocean surface temperatures in the North Atlantic Ocean that have been naturally occurring for the last 1000 years on timescales of 60-80 years. This new analysis shows that the pattern of the AMO can be accounted for by atmospheric circulation alone, without any role for the ocean circulation.\"These results force us to rethink our ability to predict decade-scale temperature fluctuations in the Atlantic and their associated impacts on land. It may be that many of the changes have limited predictability, which means that we should be prepared for a range of climate outcomes associated with global warming,\" said Clement.The work was support by grants from the Department of Energy and the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_217", "content": "For the first time, climate researchers compared both sea-level rise rates and storm surge heights in prehistoric and modern eras and found that the combined increases of each have raised the likelihood of a devastating 500-year flood occurring as often as every 25 years.\"A storm that occurred once in seven generations is now occurring twice in a generation,\" said Benjamin Horton, a Rutgers marine and coastal sciences professor. Horton also is the principal investigator on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and National Science Foundation grants funding the research.The study, \"Increased Threat of Tropical Cyclones and Coastal Flooding During the Anthropogenic Era,\" was published in PNAS (Flooding heights increased 1.2 meters from the prehistoric era to the modern era, researchers found. \"This is mainly due to the rising sea level. Sea levels have been rising in the modern era because of human activity,\" Horton said. \"Sea-level rise between hurricanes raises the 'baseline' water level and makes flooding more likely.\"Flood heights increased 1.2 meters from the prehistoric era to the modern era, mainly due to rising sea level, researchers found.In the new study, researchers provided a continuous sea-level reconstruction since A.D 850. They showed that since the late 19th century sea level has risen at its steepest rate for more than 1,000 years. What does that mean for residents along the New York/New Jersey coast? \"An extra 100,000 people flooded in the region during Hurricane Sandy who would not have flooded if sea level had not been rising,\" Horton said of the 2012 storm.Climate scientists have established that two types of storms cause the most damage -- big, slow-moving storms and smaller but higher-intensity storms -- and this study found that both have significantly increased in the modern era. \"What we do know is that as sea level rise accelerates into the future, we are going to have more frequent flooding,\" Horton said.To reconstruct sea level, the research team used microfossils called foraminifera preserved in sediment cores from coastal salt marshes in New Jersey. The age of these cores was estimated using radiocarbon dating and several other complementary techniques. \"Every inch deeper in a core takes you further back in time,\" Horton explained. \"We can stretch this technique back hundreds of years and thousands of years.\"Researchers have established that the drivers of climate changes in the prehistoric era were natural causes, while in the later period human actions have driven increases in sea-level heights and other climate measures that affect storm activity.The paper found that flood heights have increased during the modern era not only because of relative sea-level rise but also due to changing hurricane characteristics, leading to an increased risk of coastal inundation. \"The increasing flood risk projected for the coming decades presents a hazard to New York City's and New Jersey's intense concentrations of population, economic production, and static infrastructure, and indicates the necessity for risk management solutions,\" Horton said.As sea levels continue to rise at an accelerated pace, the risk of coastal flooding will rise as well. That's why the next phase of this research, led by doctoral candidate Andra Reed at Penn State University, will use the data gathered to make models to predict future sea levels and hurricane activity and when major storms like Hurricane Sandy will strike.\"We need to do this so we can provide better information to residents of New York and New Jersey and to policymakers, insurance industries and the states to prepare for how often an event as severe as Hurricane Sandy will occur,\" Horton said."}

Lai, assistant professor of epidemiology and biostatistics at the School of Public Health at Georgia State.The study, titled \"Hurricane Katrina: Maternal Depression Trajectories and Child Outcomes,\" was published recently in \"Overall, our findings indicate that the majority of mothers did not report elevated depressive symptom trajectories postdisaster,\" the report stated. However, 10 percent of the mothers reported \"chronic, persistent depressive symptoms more than two years postdisaster.\"Because maternal depression has been linked to negative parenting practices and increased behavioral problems in children, \"understanding maternal depression following a disaster is necessary for developing interventions for improving maternal adjustment,\" the report said.The study focused specifically on low-income women, the majority of whom are single parents. In their report, the researchers noted that mothers, in general, may report higher levels of depression after large-scale disasters because they often place the needs of their children above their own. Impoverished mothers face an even greater risk of developing depression in those circumstances because they may have scant support resources.The study also examined how maternal depression affected children, focusing on symptoms such as posttraumatic stress, depression and anxiety. Surprisingly, maternal depression trajectories were not associated with differences in children's distress symptoms,\" the report stated.Researchers noted that studies examining fathers' distress symptoms are needed to better understand the family dynamic after disasters.The co-authors of the study were Dr. Shannon Self-Brown, professor of health promotion and behavior at the Georgia State School of Public Health, as well as researchers Ashwini Tiwari and Brooke A.

Hasselmann Missouri Chair in Geological Engineering at Missouri S&T, was lead researcher on a paper published this spring in Water Policy law journal titled \"Interaction between the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Orleans Levee Board preceding the drainage canal wall failures and catastrophic flooding of New Orleans in 2005.\"The journal article focuses on the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers and its lack of external peer reviews that allowed for faulty flood walls to be installed in the city. It pinpoints the key factors that led to the walls' failure and the actions taken years before the disaster that allowed the engineering oversights to occur.\"As more information has emerged from the time of the disaster and its prior decision-making processes, new details allow us to have a better idea of the situation and what led to the various levee failures,\" says Rogers. \"This article is meant to put the record straight about the conclusions people drew from the disaster, many of which were based on incorrect information.\"Rogers and his co-authors contend that the main fault in the failure of the flood walls along the city's principal drainage canals was the misinterpretation of a full-scale load test carried out by the Corps in the Atachafalaya Basin a few years prior to Katrina. After these so-called E-99 tests, it was determined that flood walls in the city should be installed at a depth of 17 feet, instead of the initially estimated depths of 31 to 46 feet. This decision was made partially with the city's budget in mind, and also through a mistaken interpretation of the test results, in part because a heavy cloth tarp covered the gap that formed between the sheet-pile supports and the ground during the test. The tarp was there as a safety measure and its inadvertent impacts were not accounted for during the tests.\"After Katrina, there was a lot of finger pointing going on,\" says Rogers. \"The Corps, the Orleans Levee Board and various political factions all had a different story to tell. Reviews of the minutes of actual board meetings were crucial in unraveling what people were thinking at the time, and how their principal focus was on other aspects of the flood protection system, of which the flood walls were just one untried piece.\"The journal article states that critics forget that the Corps had built thousands of miles of levees along rivers throughout the nation that functioned adequately. The flooding that killed 1,836 people in New Orleans and caused billions of dollars in property damage might have been prevented if the Corps had retained an external review board to double-check its designs of the new flood walls, built in the 1990s and early 2000s, says Rogers.Legal responsibility for annual upkeep and inspection of the flood protection system rested with the Corps. The article's authors hope to set the record straight with respect to the critical role played by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_220", "content": "But other coastal regions across the world remain vulnerable to damaging storms, and providing similar protection for the tens of millions of people living in those areas will require international action, says University of Wyoming economist Edward Barbier.In a featured commentary, titled, \"Hurricane Katrina's lessons for the world,\" and published in the journal \"For the parts of the world that have extremely vulnerable populations, I think there are lessons that can be learned from the planning strategy that took place in Louisiana after Hurricane Katrina,\" says Barbier, the John S. Bugas Professor of Economics and Finance in the UW College of Business.After Katrina caused about $110 billion in damage, killed more than 1,800 people and displaced 1.2 million others, Louisiana's Coastal Protection Restoration Authority was formed to coordinate local, state and federal efforts to develop a more sustainable coast. Barbier was a member of the science and engineering board that oversaw the scientific analysis for the resulting 2012 Coastal Master Plan.The plan guides Gulf Coast protection and restoration projects over the next 50 years, with a total budget of $50 billion. Those projects include creation of new marshlands and building levees.\"What the 2012 Louisiana Coastal Master Plan represents is a new way of thinking about long-term coastal management to make coastlines more resilient to short-term natural hazards such as hurricanes and storm surges, and also to protect and adapt to long-term climate change,\" Barbier says.Similar strategies are urgently needed for other parts of the world, he says, noting that coastal areas \"are the front lines of climate change.\" The gradual impacts of sea-level rise, saline intrusion and erosion resulting from a warming climate -- added to the potential for extreme damage caused by accompanying increases in storm-caused flooding and surges -- should make international action a priority.Barbier notes that around 38 percent of the global population -- 2.5 billion people -- lives within 100 kilometers (62 miles) of the coast, and more than three-quarters of them are in developing countries. The most vulnerable are the poor, rural populations in developing countries who live in low-elevation coastal zones less than 10 meters above sea level.Almost all of the world's 60 million poor people living in those low-elevation zones reside in 15 countries: India, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Cambodia, Nigeria, Pakistan, Iraq, Mozambique, Senegal, Brazil, China, Indonesia, the Philippines, Vietnam and Thailand.\"These 15 nations should be the priority for a long-term global planning strategy to protect coasts and populations that are vulnerable to damaging storms,\" Barbier wrote.He notes that many of these people depend on agriculture and fishing, industries that are particularly at risk for disruption by storms and climate change. Natural barriers, such as mangroves, provide protection against storms and other coastal hazards, but those barriers are being eroded.Barbier advocates for polices and investments to drive economic diversification away from fishing and agriculture and toward manufacturing and services in these regions. In addition, restoration of coastal features including salt marshes, coral reefs, mangroves and beaches -- along with construction of seawalls, dikes and other structures -- is necessary to protect vulnerable populations.In some cases, people most at risk of harm from storms and gradual sea-level rises \"may need to be encouraged to migrate to non-coastal areas,\" he wrote.Such efforts to develop long-term coastal planning strategies should be financed through international climate-change adaptation funds, Barbier says. They could be done in conjunction with national and local governments in coastal zones on a cost-sharing basis.Various United Nations programs, such as the United Nation's Green Climate Fund, and the World Bank are appropriate sources of funding to help developing countries in their efforts to enhance and protect coasts and populations vulnerable to damaging storms, he says.Widely published in natural resource and development economics as well as the interface between economics and ecology, Barbier has served as a consultant and policy analyst for a variety of national, international and non-governmental agencies, including many United Nations organizations and the World Bank. He has written more than 200 peer-reviewed journal articles and book chapters, written or edited 22 books, and published in popular journals."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_221", "content": "\"Hurricane Katrina is indeed part of this story,\" said James Randerson, Chancellor's Professor of Earth system science at UCI and senior author on the paper. \"The ocean conditions that led to a severe hurricane season in 2005 also reduced atmospheric moisture flow to South America, contributing to a once-in-a-century dry spell in the Amazon. The timing of these events is perfectly consistent with our research findings.\"Lead author Yang Chen discovered that in addition to the well-understood east-west influence of El NiÃ±o on the Amazon, there's also a north-south control on fire activity that's set by the state of the tropical North Atlantic. Warm ocean waters help hurricanes develop and gather strength and speed on their way to North American shores. They also tend to pull a large belt of tropical rainfall -- known as the Intertropical Convergence Zone -- to the north, Chen said, drawing moisture away from the southern Amazon and leading to heightened fire risk over time.\"North Atlantic hurricanes and Amazon fires are related to one another through shared linkages to ocean-atmosphere interactions in the tropical Atlantic Ocean,\" he said.The mechanics of the ocean-fire link in the Amazon are fairly straightforward. When the North Atlantic sea surface temperatures are warmer than normal, less rain falls in the southern Amazon. As a consequence, groundwater is not fully recharged by the end of the rainy season. Coming into the next dry spell, when there's less water stored away in the soil, plants can't evaporate and transpire as much water out through their stems and leaves. As a result, the atmosphere gets drier and drier, creating conditions in which fires can spread rapidly. Ground-clearing fires set by farmers for agricultural purposes can easily jump from fields to dense forests under these conditions.\"Understory fires in Amazon forests are extremely damaging, since most rainforest trees are not adapted to fire,\" noted co-author Douglas Morton of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. \"The synchronization of forest damages from fires in South America and tropical storms in North America highlights how important it is to consider the Earth as a system.\"The team pored over years of historical storm and sea surface temperature data from the National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration and fire data gathered by NASA satellites. The results showed a striking pattern, a progression over the course of several months from warm waters in the tropical North Atlantic to a dry and fire-prone southern Amazon and more destructive hurricane landfalls in North and Central America.According to Randerson, the importance of this study is that it may help meteorologists develop better seasonal outlooks for drought and fire risk in the Amazon, leveraging investments by NOAA and other agencies in understanding hurricanes. The research findings also give policymakers throughout the hemisphere a basis for decisions about coastal protections in hurricane-prone areas and fire management in drought-affected areas.\"The fires we see in the U.S. West are generally lightning-ignited, whereas they're mostly human-ignited in the Amazon, but climate change can have really large effects on the fire situation in both regions,\" Randerson said. \"Keeping fire out of the Amazon basin is critical from a carbon-cycle perspective. There's a huge amount of carbon stored in tropical forests; we really want to keep the forests intact.\"Randerson and Chen credit NASA and NOAA for providing free public access to real-time data from their satellites and other sensors and the Gordon & Betty Moore Foundation, NASA and the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Science for research support.\"Drought in the Amazon and hurricanes in the North Atlantic are such costly and potentially catastrophic disturbances [that] we really rely on NASA and NOAA for help in making accurate forecasts and long-range predictions,\" Randerson said."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_222", "content": "Tropical storms obtain their energy from the ocean waters below. As a storm moves across the Gulf of Mexico, it may interact with an upwelling of cooler waters from the deeper ocean or, in the case of Isaac, a downwelling inside rings of warm water that separated from a warm-water current, called the Loop Current, that moves through the Gulf of Mexico to join with the Gulf Stream along the U.S. East Coast. As the storm moves forward, ocean temperatures are fueling the storm's intensity.UM Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science researchers, in collaboration with NOAA's Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory, deployed a total of 376 airborne sensors during six NOAA hurricane hunter aircraft flights conducted before, during, and after the passage of Isaac over the eastern Gulf of Mexico. The researchers observed a predominant downwelling of water inside these warm-water rings, or eddies, from the Loop Current, which caused its intensification from a tropical storm to a category 1 hurricane just prior to landfall.\"These results underscore the need for forecast models to include upwelling-downwelling responses to improve intensity forecasting and current transport,\" said Benjamin Jaimes, an assistant scientist at the UM Rosenstiel School.\"Isaac moved over the region of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill where we observed both upwelling and downwelling processes that can re-suspend hydrocarbons lying on the seafloor,\" said Nick Shay, professor of ocean sciences at the UM Rosenstiel School. \"This may have resulted in tar balls being deposited on beaches by hurricane-generated currents.\"Tropical storm Isaac gradually intensified in the Gulf of Mexico to reach category 1 hurricane status as an 80 mph (130 km/h) storm, making landfall along the coast of Louisiana.

For example, the Department recently extended programs for behavioral health assistance and lead screening for another year.\"\"It was striking to us and to our field team of over 30 interviewers how Sandy still dominated the lives of so many New Jersey residents,\" added Rutgers University's Dr. Donna Van Alst, the study's co-Principal Investigator, \"even two and a half years after the event. People across the economic spectrum were affected.\" Other findings from the study revealed that:The findings from this study are based on face-to-face surveys with 1,000 randomly sampled New Jersey residents living in the state's nine most-affected counties. The research team from the four universities deployed a team of nearly three-dozen community-based interviewers to conduct the surveys. In addition, the team used flood storm surge data and housing damage data to identify a \"disaster footprint,\" the geographic area within New Jersey that was exposed to Sandy.The 1,000-person sample was drawn so as to be representative of the 1,047,000 residents living in this Disaster Footprint. The footprint extends from Cape May in the south of the state to several miles north of the George Washington Bridge, and stretches from the shoreline to over 20 miles inland.The study is modeled upon a similar five-year study conducted by Abramson and Columbia University's National Center for Disaster Preparedness in Louisiana and Mississippi after Hurricane Katrina, the Gulf Coast Child and Family Health Study. The Sandy study was funded by the New Jersey Department of Health using Social Services Block Grant (SSBG) -- Sandy Supplemental funds. Department of Health Commissioner O'Dowd recognized this study as an opportunity to gain valuable, unprecedented insight on the public health impact of the storm on New Jersey residents and to guide the Department's recovery activities.The first two Briefing Reports were released on July 29, 2015, \"The Hurricane Sandy PLACE Report: Evacuation Decisions, Housing Issues, and Sense of Community,\" and \"The Hurricane Sandy PERSON Report: Exposure, health, Economic Burden, and Social Well-Being.\" Additional Briefing Reports that focus on persistent and unmet needs, and the status of residents' disaster recovery, will be released in the next several months.\"The similarities between Hurricanes Katrina and Sandy are quite disturbing,\" noted NYU's Abramson. \"Many adults and children are still experiencing emotional and psychological effects, so long after the storm passed. In a significant number of cases housing damage is at the heart of the problem, and it's very concerning to hear that so many of the federally-financed programs have ended even though the needs still clearly persist.\"Experts are further concerned that the results of this study reflect a pattern that is seen after many large-scale disasters here in the U.S and internationally. \"By far, one of the least understood aspects of disaster management is how to make recovery from catastrophic events efficient and rapid, so that people can return to a state of normalcy as quickly as possible,\" said Irwin Redlener, MD, Director of the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University's Earth Institute. \"This prolonged uncertainty and persistent trauma are very difficult for families and especially traumatic for children,\" added Dr. Redlener, who is president of the Children's Health Fund and a professor at the Mailman School of Public Health.The two reports can be found at:"}

Their analysis included many of the 17 U.S. port cities with populations over one million, for which the occurrence of compound flooding had not been previously assessed.Armed with data reaching back into the 1950s, and some data from the beginning 20th century for some sites, they determined that the risk for compound flooding was higher for cities along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts than for those on the Pacific coast. Consequently, they looked more closely at selected regions along the Atlantic coast.When they analyzed the data specific for New York City in greater detail, the researchers determined that storm surges in New York City (where compound flooding events are increasing) are accompanied by heavy precipitation when a high pressure system stretches from Newfoundland south over the North Atlantic from where moist air is transported into the low-pressure system causing the storm surge. They also noted that the extreme flooding in that region during \"Hurricane Sandy\" in 2012 was the result of extreme storm surge but that the rainfall during that storm was (fortunately) \"small in the historical context for such an event.\"Overall, they found that the number of compound flooding events has been steadily increasing over the past century along many stretches of coastline.\"Our results demonstrate the importance of assessing compound flooding and its links to weather and climate, but we need more research at local scales to determine impacts,\" concluded Wahl and his colleagues. \"That research will require complex, integrated modeling experiments that investigate surface and drainage flows and include storm surge, rainfall and river discharge. In light of climate variability and change, it will be important to develop a detailed understanding of future patterns of storm surge and high precipitation amounts occurring in tandem.\""}

However, it's unclear how such protective measures will affect the shape of the river delta, and its communities, over time.Now researchers from MIT and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) have devised a simple way to predict a river delta's shape, given two competing factors: its river's force in depositing sediment into the ocean, and ocean waves' strength in pushing that sediment back along the coast. Depending on the balance of the two, the coastline of a river delta may take on a smooth \"cuspate\" shape, or a more pointed \"crenulated\" outline, resembling a bird's foot.The new metric may help engineers determine how the shape of a delta, such as the Mississippi's, may shift in response to engineered structures such as dams and levees, and environmental changes, such as hurricane activity and sea-level rise.Jaap Nienhuis, a graduate student in the MIT-WHOI Joint Program in Marine Geology and Geophysics, says the effects of climate change, and the human efforts to combat these effects, are already making an impact on river deltas around the world.\"Because there are so many people living on a river delta, you want to know what its morphology or shape will look like in the future,\" Nienhuis says. \"For the Mississippi, the river supplies a lot of sediment. But because there are a lot of dams on the Mississippi nowadays, there is not as much sand coming down the river, so people are very worried about how this delta will evolve, especially with sea-level rise, over the coming centuries.\"Nienhuis, and Andrew Ashton and Liviu Glosan of WHOI, report their results in the journal Over hundreds of thousands of years, a river's sand and silt flow toward the coast, ultimately piling up at a river's mouth in the form of a low-lying delta. A delta's coastline can be relatively smooth, with most sand depositing from the main river, or it can fan out in the shape of a bird's foot, as the river bifurcates into tributaries and channels, each of which deposits sand in finger-like projections.Scientists often characterize a delta as either river-dominated or wave-dominated.In a wave-dominated delta, such as the Nile River delta in Egypt, incoming ocean waves are stronger than the river's flow. As a result, waves push outflowing sediment back along the coast, effectively smoothing the coastline. By contrast, a river-dominated delta, such as the Mississippi's, is shaped by a stronger river, which deposits sand faster than ocean waves can push back, creating a crenulated coastline.While this relationship between rivers and ocean waves is generally understood, Nienhuis says there is no formal way to determine when a delta will tip toward a smooth or pointy shape.The researchers came up with a simple ratio to predict a delta's shape, based on a river's sediment flux, or the flow rate of sediment through a river, and the strength of ocean waves, determined by a wave's height, frequency, and angle of approach.Based on the various factors that determine the overall ratio, the team determined the point at which a delta would no longer be a smooth outline, shaped by ocean waves, but instead, a pointy coastline, influenced more by the river.\"At some point there's so much sediment that you exceed the maximum of what waves can do,\" Nienhuis says, \"and then you become a 'bird foot,' or river-dominated delta, because the river is so much stronger.\"Nienhuis and his colleagues applied the new method to 25 river deltas on the north shore of the Indonesian island of Java, a region where sediments have deposited on a shallow continental shelf, creating a wide variety of delta shapes.For each delta, the team used a global wave model developed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to determine the height, frequency, and direction of each incoming wave. The researchers also used a model to determine the corresponding river's sediment flux.Using data from both models, Nienhuis determined the ratio of river-to-ocean wave strength for each delta, and found that those deltas with a ratio greater than or equal to 1 were more likely to have multiple river channels, with deltas that project out from the shoreline. The main factor determining this transition turned out to be the angle at which ocean waves generally approach the coast: If the angle of approach is 45 degrees or greater, then ocean waves are no longer able to smooth out the amount of sediment coming from a river, tipping a delta's shape toward a river-dominated morphology.Nienhuis says the group's method may help engineers predict the shape a delta may take if erected dams or levees change a river's sediment flow. Similarly, the method may estimate the evolution of deltas with climate change, as rising sea levels and increased hurricane activity will likely alter the behavior and magnitude of ocean waves."}

Hypoxic zones hold very little oxygen, and are caused by excessive nutrient pollution, primarily from activities such as agriculture and wastewater. The low oxygen levels cannot support most marine life and habitats in near-bottom waters.This year marks the first time the results of four models were combined. The four model predictions ranged from 4,344 to 5,985 square miles, and had a collective predictive interval of 3,205 to 7,645 square miles, which take into account variations in weather and oceanographic conditions.The NOAA-sponsored Gulf of Mexico hypoxia forecast has improved steadily in recent years, a result of advancements of individual models and an increase in the number of models used for the forecast. Forecasts based on multiple models are called ensemble forecasts and are commonly used in hurricane and other weather forecasts.The ensemble models were developed by NOAA-sponsored modeling teams and researchers at the University of Michigan, Louisiana State University, Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium, Virginia Institute of Marine Sciences/College of William and Mary, Texas A&M University, North Carolina State University, and the United States Geological Survey (USGS). The hypoxia forecast is part of a larger NOAA effort to deliver ecological forecasts that support human health and well-being, coastal economies, and coastal and marine stewardship.\"NOAA, along with our partners, continues to improve our capability to generate environmental data that can help mitigate and manage this threat to Gulf fisheries and economies,\" said Kathryn D. Sullivan, Ph.D., under secretary of commerce for oceans and atmosphere and NOAA administrator. \"We are adding models to increase the accuracy of our dead zone forecast.\"The Gulf of Mexico hypoxia forecast is based on nutrient runoff and river stream data from the USGS. The USGS operates more than 3,000 real-time stream gauges, 50 real-time nitrate sensors, and collects water quality data at long-term stations throughout the Mississippi River basin to track how nutrient loads are changing over time.The USGS estimates that 104,000 metric tons of nitrate and 19,300 metric tons of phosphorus flowed down the Mississippi and Atchafalaya rivers into the Gulf of Mexico in May 2015. This is about 21 percent below the long-term (1980-2014) average for nitrogen, and 16 percent above the long-term average for phosphorus.\"Real-time nitrate sensors are advancing our understanding of how nitrate is transported in small streams and large rivers, including the main stem of the Mississippi River,\" said William Werkheiser, USGS associate director for water. \"Long-term monitoring is critical to tracking how nutrient levels are changing in response to management actions and for improving modeling tools to estimate which sources and areas are contributing the largest amounts of nutrients to the Gulf. \"The confirmed size of the 2015 Gulf hypoxic zone will be released in early August, following a monitoring survey led by the Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium from July 28 to August 4."}

The first suggests that the canyon may have started incising 17 million years ago. The second suggests that the canyon may have looked largely as it does today 70 million years ago. The time contrast between these hypotheses is striking, and any accurate concept of the canyon would have to be consistent with all observations.Other researchers have studied the Grand Wash Fault, which truncates the western Grand Canyon. The fault runs north to south, nearly perpendicular to the Canyon. The fault slides in such a way that the west side of the fracture moves down relative to the east side, leaving a cliff face called the Grand Wash Cliffs. This slip, called \"normal slip,\" has led to the opening of a valley called the Grand Wash trough along the east end of Lake Meade. Erosion of hillslopes and canyons in the Grand Wash Cliffs is driven by the fault movement exposing the rock at the surface. These hillslopes and canyons are similar to the Colorado River's tributaries in Grand Canyon, except hills and side streams are all steeper in Grand Canyon.This comparison is useful because the Grand Wash fault has been studied extensively, and other scientists have shown that the fault completed most of its sliding between 18 and 12 million years ago. The rocks and climate in both regions are similar, so the difference in landform shape is most likely due to when the landforms started eroding.In this new article for"}

The new CORS stations are being funded by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Geodetic Survey and put into place through the newly formed Gulf Coast Spatial Reference Consortium, a partnership among the Conrad Blucher Institute for Surveying and Science at Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi, Louisiana State University's Center for Geoinformatics, the University of Southern Mississippi's Mississippi Spatial Reference Center and the Alabama Department of Transportation. The consortium provides Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) data consisting of carrier phase and code range measurements in support of three dimensional positioning, meteorology, space weather and geophysical applications along the Gulf of Mexico.CORS, which are being added at or near NOAA tide gauges in each Gulf state, provide location data at centimeter-level accuracy. Improved accuracy is necessary for coastal mapping, surveying and restoration, for flood protection and to aid the development of better coastal models for hurricanes and flooding. The tools can also help resource managers better identify long-term trends in sea level rise and the sinking of coastal lands (called coastal subsidence).\"We are excited to be part of this project to provide the latest geospatial data with information from tide gauges, sea level observations, land elevation reference points and 3D positioning,\" said Dr. Gary Jeffress, Director of CBI. \"This system will help local and regional leaders plan for improved resilience to any impacts of sea level rise or subsidence and coastal storm surge flooding. The project will assist development of long-term strategies to address coastal change impacts along the northern Gulf of Mexico.\"When the upgrades are fully implemented, CORS stations will cover some 16,000 miles of shorelines, bays and estuaries. So far, four stations in Florida and five in Texas have been installed; six additional CORS stations will be installed in Florida, Alabama and Louisiana this year, with remaining stations installed in 2016. Several of these stations are being added near busy U.S. ports and population centers in the Gulf of Mexico.NOAA also recently installed PORTSÂ® in two locations in Louisiana. PORTSÂ® is an integrated system of oceanographic and meteorological sensors that provides mariners with accurate and reliable real-time information about environmental conditions in seaports, including water levels, currents, water density and meteorology. The installation of two new PORTSÂ® systems in Louisiana brings the total PORTSÂ® operating in the Gulf to nine.The new Louisiana PORTSÂ® were installed by NOAA at Port Fourchon, which services 90 percent of the Gulf's deepwater oil and gas industry and provides more than 20 percent of the U.S.' daily energy supply, and Morgan City/Atchafalaya Bay, a newly established foreign trade port.\"Real-time knowledge of the currents, water levels, winds and density of the water can increase the amount of cargo moved through a port and harbor and enable mariners to safely use available channel depths,\" said Rich Edwing, NOAA's Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services (CO-OPS) director. \"Even one additional foot of draft can substantially increase the profit of a shipment.\"Information from these and other sensing instruments in the Gulf of Mexico are provided in real time and near-real time through the GCOOS Regional Association's free and publicly accessible data portal, online at \"As a region with rapidly growing communities along low-lying coastal areas and an infrastructure that is critical to our nation's energy security, improving and enhancing our coastal observing systems are vital to our nation's interests,\" said Dr. Barbara Kirkpatrick, Executive Director of the GCOOS-RA. \"More than 14 million people call the Gulf Coast home. The Gulf is also a vital economic driver for the regional and the U.S. economies, providing jobs for 20 million people and generating $234 billion annually.\"Better predictive capabilities for storms and flooding is of utmost importance to protecting lives, commerce and our nation's energy supply.\"Enhancing navigation is also important, Kirkpatrick said, when you stop to consider that the Gulf has 14 of the top 20 U.S. ports by tonnage and that in 2012, when Hurricane Isaac forced the closure of a single port, the Port of New Orleans, for four days, it resulted in the estimated loss of more than $400 million and had a ripple effect on the global supply chain."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_229", "content": "For the hurricane season, which officially runs from June 1 -- November 30, NOAA is predicting a 70 percent likelihood of 6 to 11 named storms (winds of 39 mph or higher), of which 3 to 6 could become hurricanes (winds of 74 mph or higher), including zero to 2 major hurricanes (Category 3, 4 or 5; winds of 111 mph or higher). While a below-normal season is likely (70 percent), there is also a 20 percent chance of a near-normal season, and a 10 percent chance of an above-normal season.\"A below-normal season doesn't mean we're off the hook. As we've seen before, below-normal seasons can still produce catastrophic impacts to communities,\" said NOAA Administrator Kathryn Sullivan, Ph.D., referring to the 1992 season in which only seven named storms formed, yet the first was Andrew -- a Category 5 Major Hurricane that devastated South Florida.\"The main factor expected to suppress the hurricane season this year is El NiÃ±o, which is already affecting wind and pressure patterns, and is forecast to last through the hurricane season,\" said Gerry Bell, Ph.D., lead seasonal hurricane forecaster with NOAA. \"El NiÃ±o may also intensify as the season progresses, and is expected to have its greatest influence during the peak months of the season. We also expect sea surface temperatures in the tropical Atlantic to be close to normal, whereas warmer waters would have supported storm development.\"Included in today's outlook is Tropical Storm Ana, but its pre-season development is not an indicator of the overall season strength. Ana's development was typical of pre-season named storms, which often form along frontal boundaries in association with a trough in the jet stream. This method of formation differs from the named storms during the peak of the season, which originate mainly from low-pressure systems moving westward from Africa, and are independent of frontal boundaries and the jet stream.With the new hurricane season comes a new prototype storm surge watch/warning graphic from NOAA's National Hurricane Center, intended to highlight areas along the Gulf and Atlantic coasts of the United States that have a significant risk of life-threatening inundation by storm surge from a tropical cyclone.The new graphic will introduce the concept of a watch or warning specific to the storm surge hazard. Storm surge is often the greatest threat to life and property from a tropical cyclone, and it can occur at different times and at different locations from a storm's hazardous winds. In addition, while most coastal residents can remain in their homes and be safe from a tropical cyclone's winds, evacuations are often needed to keep people safe from storm surge. Having separate warnings for these two hazards should provide emergency managers, the media, and the general public better guidance on the hazards they face when tropical cyclones threaten.Also new this season is a higher resolution version (2 km near the storm area) of NOAA's Hurricane Weather Research and Forecasting model (HWRF), thanks to the upgrades to operational computing. A new 40-member HWRF ensemble-based data assimilation system will also be implemented to make better use of aircraft reconnaissance-based Tail Doppler Radar data for improved intensity forecasts. Retrospective testing of 2015 HWRF upgrades demonstrated a five percent improvement in the intensity forecasts compared to last year.\"It only takes one hurricane or tropical storm making landfall in your community to significantly disrupt your life,\" said FEMA Deputy Administrator Joseph Nimmich. \"Everyone should take action now to prepare themselves and their families for hurricanes and powerful storms. Develop a family communications plan, build an emergency supply kit for your home, and take time to learn evacuation routes for your area. Knowing what to do ahead of time can literally save your life and help you bounce back stronger and faster should disaster strike in your area.\""}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_230", "content": "But that simply isn't true, according to a Florida State University researcher.Vasu Misra, associate professor of meteorology, disputed the commonly held belief in an article published in the journal \"The perception that land-falling tropical cyclones serve to replenish the terrestrial water sources in many of the small watersheds in the southeastern U.S. seems to be a myth,\" Misra said. \"This perception is widespread because the southeastern United States has the largest share of land-falling tropical cyclones in the country.\"Misra and Satish Bastola from Georgia Institute of Technology examined historical rainfall records and from that, created a soil moisture-based drought index for 28 watersheds across the southeastern United States for a 58-year period. They then reconstructed the database by eliminating the rainfall on days when a tropical storm or hurricane had made landfall.The end result? Soil moisture levels in these watersheds remained about the same.That's because the atmospheric circulation during summer droughts often create favorable conditions for steering a tropical storm or hurricane away from land.Additionally, when tropical cyclones do make landfall, it is usually during a season when the soil is already wet. The additional saturation does nothing for the overall soil moisture conditions, Misra said.According to a NOAA report, 37.4 percent of the contiguous United States was experiencing moderate drought at the end of April.For the 2015 Atlantic storm season, which begins June 1, the Weather Channel has projected a total of nine named storms, five hurricanes and one major hurricane. The 30-year average is 12 named storms, six hurricanes and three major hurricanes.This study was funded by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the U.S. Geological Survey."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_231", "content": "In a paper published today by \"We're seeing fewer hurricanes, but the ones we do see are more intense,\" Elsner said. \"When one comes, all hell can break loose.\"Prior to this research, there had been some discussions among scientists about how warmer ocean temperatures affected the intensity of a hurricane. Elsner and Kang wanted to further explore that concept as well as the number of storms that occurred each year.Hurricanes can form when ocean waters are 79 degrees Fahrenheit or more. As the warm water evaporates, it provides the energy a storm needs to become a hurricane. Higher temperatures mean higher levels of energy, which would ultimately affect wind speed.Specifically, Elsner and Kang projected that over the past 30 years, storm speeds have increased on average by 1.3 meters per second -- or 3 miles per hour -- and there were 6.1 fewer storms than there would have been if land and water temperatures had remained constant.\"It's basically a tradeoff between frequency and intensity,\" Elsner said.According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Earth is roughly 1.53 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than it was last century.Elsner and Kang said the yearly temperatures can also be a good indicator of what's yet to come in a given storm season.\"In a warmer year, stronger but fewer tropical cyclones are likely to occur,\" said Kang, now deputy director of the National Typhoon Center in South Korea. \"In a colder year, on the other hand, weaker but more tropical cyclones.\"For the 2015 Atlantic storm season, which begins June 1, a total of nine named storms, five hurricanes and one major hurricane have been projected.

{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_232", "content": "Mature, intense tropical cyclones can and often do undergo what is known as an eyewall replacement cycle wherein a new eye wall or ring of convection within the outer rain bands forms further out from the storm's center, outside the radius of the original eye wall, and begins to choke off the original eye wall, starving it of moisture and momentum. Eventually, if the cycle is completed, the original eye wall dissipates and this new outer eye wall can contract and replace the old eye wall. The storm's intensity can fluctuate over this period, initially weakening as the inner eye wall dies before again strengthening as the outer eye wall contracts. Eye wall replacement cycles are hard to forecast.Here TRMM provided a look at a classic eye wall replacement cycle in progress. At the very center is the eye of Super Typhoon Maysak, which is devoid of rain where air is descending. Immediately surrounding the eye is the original inner eye wall where air is rising in convective updrafts and releasing heat through condensation. The vast amounts of heat being released into the storm as a result is known as latent heating and is what drives the storm's circulation. The inner eye wall is identified by the nearly complete ring of very intense rainfall with rates on the order of 100 mm/hr or more (~4 inches/hr, shown by the white areas inside the light purple) in the southwestern semicircle. Outside of the inner eye wall is a very distinct ring of very weak rain (~5 mm/hr or less, shown in blue), known as the moat. The moat marks the area between the inner and outer eye walls where air that has already risen through the updrafts in the eye walls is now subsiding, suppressing rain. Next, outside of the moat is the new outer eye wall, shown by the nearly perfect concentric ring of moderate (shown in green) to heavy (shown in red) rain rates. Additional bands of light to moderate rain (blue and green areas, respectively) wrap around the northeast quadrant Maysak.Another key aspect of Maysak's features as revealed by TRMM is their near perfect symmetry around the storm's center. This is a clear sign of the storm's intensity. The more intense the circulation, the more uniformly rain features are wrapped around the center. Indeed, at the time this image was taken by TRMM, Maysak's maximum sustained winds were estimated to be 140 knots (~161 mph) by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center, making it a Category 5 super typhoon (equivalent to a Category 5 hurricane on the U.S. Saffir-Simpson scale).Maysak is the first super typhoon of the season in the Northwest Pacific Basin. The storm is forecast to weaken before approaching the northern Philippines in the next couple of days. TRMM is a joint mission between NASA and the Japanese space agency JAXA."}

The team's research paper was published online in the journal \"Our model is better at predicting the number of seasonal hurricanes in the Atlantic than the other existing models,\" said first author Kyle Davis, a master's student in the UA atmospheric sciences department. \"On average, our model has 23 percent less error for predicting hurricanes occurring since 2001.\"Hurricanes are storms with maximum wind speeds in excess of 73 mph and are among the most damaging natural disasters in the U.S. The Atlantic hurricane season lasts from June 1 to Nov. 30.The UA model can provide its forecast by the start of hurricane season, which allows people to prepare better for the upcoming season, Davis said. \"Tens of millions of people are threatened by Atlantic hurricanes. It affects their properties, it affects their lives.\"The team developed the new model by using data from the 1950 to 2013 hurricane seasons. They tested the new model by seeing if it could \"hindcast\" the number of hurricanes that occurred each season from 1900 to 1949.\"It performed really well in the period from 1949 to 1900,\" Davis said. \"That's the most convincing test of our model.\"Other investigators have estimated that damages from U.S. hurricanes from 1970 to 2002 cost $57 billion in 2015 dollars -- more than earthquakes and human-caused disasters combined for the time period.Better seasonal predictions can help cities and governments in emergency management planning, said co-author Xubin Zeng, who holds the Agnese N. Haury Chair in Environment and is a UA professor of atmospheric sciences.The paper, \"A new statistical model to predict seasonal North Atlantic hurricane activity,\" by Davis, Zeng and Elizabeth A. Ritchie, a UA atmospheric sciences professor, is scheduled for print publication in a future issue of the journal of Good forecasts of hurricane seasons have been around only since the early 1980s, Zeng said. The historical average in the 20th century was six hurricanes per year.Until about the late 1990s, the existing models did a good job of predicting how many hurricanes would occur each year. However, in the 21st century the number of hurricanes per season became more variable, with 15 occurring in 2005 but only two in 2013.Zeng wondered why the computer models didn't work well anymore, and his new graduate student Davis, an actuary, wanted to study natural disasters because of their impact.\"Xubin steered me into hurricane forecasting,\" Davis said.Zeng challenged Davis to develop a hurricane forecasting model that surpassed the existing ones.\"It was a tremendous effort -- trying endless combinations of things, new creative ways of doing things,\" Davis said.The other forecasting models relied heavily on the state of the El NiÃ±o climate cycle, a three-to-seven-year cycle that affects weather all over the globe.One of the UA team's innovations was using the state of a longer-term climate cycle called the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation to judge how much influence El NiÃ±o has in a particular year.The AMO affects ocean temperatures, cycling from colder to warmer and back over a time scale of approximately 40-70 years. The AMO was in a warm phase from the late 1920s to the early 1960s and started cycling back toward warm in the late 1990s. Warmer sea surface temperatures generally generate more hurricanes.Zeng suggested also including the force of the wind on the ocean -- an innovation that, to the best of the team's knowledge, no other statistical model used. Strong winds reduce sea surface temperatures because they mix the ocean layers, thereby bringing cooler, deeper water to the surface.After much trial and error, Davis met Zeng's challenge. The model Davis developed does a better job of forecasting the Atlantic hurricane season by incorporating the force of the wind on the ocean and the sea surface temperature over the Atlantic. The model includes the effect of El NiÃ±o only for years when the AMO is in the cool phase.Compared with the other models, the UA model de-emphasized the role of El NiÃ±o when the AMO is in the warm phase, as it has been for the past 15 years.Next the team plans to examine the forecasting models for the eastern Pacific hurricanes -- the ones that hit Baja California and the western coast of Mexico and Central America."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_234", "content": "A paper by Denniston and 10 others, including a 2014 Cornell College graduate, is published this week in the journal Denniston is one of few researchers worldwide using stalagmites to reconstruct past tropical cyclone activity, a field of research called paleotempestology. His work in Australia began in 2009 and was originally intended to focus on the chemical composition of the stalagmites as a means of reconstructing past changes in the intensity of Australian summer monsoon rains. But Denniston and his research team found more than just variations in the chemical composition of the stalagmites they examined; they discovered that the interiors of the stalagmites also contained prominent layers of mud.\"Seeing mud accumulations like these was really unusual,\" Denniston said. \"There was no doubt that the mud layers came from the cave having flooded. The water stirred up the sediment and when the water receded, the mud coated everything in the cave -- the floor, the walls, and the stalagmites. Then the stalagmites started forming again and the mud got trapped inside.\"The stalagmites were precisely dated by Denniston, Cornell College geology majors, and Denniston's colleagues at the University of New Mexico. Once the ages of the stalagmites were known, the mud layers were measured. Angelique Gonzales '14, who worked with Denniston on the research and is third author on the paper, examined nearly 11 meters of stalagmites, measuring them in half millimeter increments and recording the location and thickness of mud layers. This work gave the team more than 2,000 years of data about the frequency of cave flooding.But the origins of the floods were still unclear. Given the area's climatology, Denniston found that these rains could have come from the Australian monsoon or from tropical cyclones.\"We were sort of stuck,\" Denniston said, \"but then I started working with Gabriele.\" Gabriele Villarini, an assistant professor of engineering at the University of Iowa and the second author of the paper, studies extreme meteorological events, what drives the frequency and magnitude of those events, and their impact on policy and economics. With Denniston and Gonzales, Villarini examined historical rainfall records from a weather station near the cave.\"The largest rainfall events, almost regardless of duration, are tied to tropical cyclones,\" Villarini said.Next, they compared flood events recorded in a stalagmite that grew over the past several decades to historical records of tropical cyclones. This analysis revealed that timing of flood events in the cave was consistent with the passing of tropical cyclones through the area. Thus, the researchers interpreted the flood layers in their stalagmites largely as recording tropical cyclone activity.The resulting data tell scientists about more than just the frequencies of tropical cyclones in one part of Australia over the past 2,200 years. A major driver of year-to-year changes in tropical cyclones around the world is the El NiÃ±o/Southern Oscillation, which influences weather patterns across the globe. During El NiÃ±o events, for example, Australia and the Atlantic generally experience fewer tropical cyclones, while during La NiÃ±a events, the climatological opposite of El NiÃ±o, the regions see more tropical cyclones.\"Our work, and that of several other researchers, reveals that the frequency of storms has changed over the past hundreds and thousands of years,\" Denniston said. \"But why? Could it have been due to El NiÃ±o? Direct observations only go back about a hundred years, and there hasn't been much variation in the nature of El NiÃ±o/Southern Oscillation over that time. Further back there was more, and so our goal was to test the link between storms and El NiÃ±o in prehistory.\"Denniston noted that the variations over time in the numbers of flood events recorded by his stalagmites matched reconstructed numbers of hurricanes in the Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico, and Caribbean.\"Tropical cyclone activity in these regions responds similarly to El NiÃ±o, and previous studies had also suggested that some periods, such as those when we had lots of flood layers in our stalagmites, were likely characterized by more frequent La NiÃ±as. Similarly, times with fewer storms were characterized by more frequent El NiÃ±os.\" The results of this study mark an important step towards understanding how future climate change may be expressed.\"It is difficult to use climate models to study hurricane activity, and so studies such as ours, which produced a record of storms under different climate conditions, are important for our understanding of future storm activity,\" Denniston said.Gonzales, who is planning to pursue a Ph.D. in geology, said that her experience with Denniston and his research, including two senior seminars and an honors thesis, was valuable because she got both field and lab experience as she helped determine not just what had happened in the past, but what that meant.\"There were a lot of different aspects to put this together -- dating, measuring, literature review, and modeling,\" she said. \"It was really exciting.\"Denniston is now gearing up to establish a detailed cave monitoring program in this and other regional caves. \"We want to extend this study,\" he said, \"to examine what conditions trigger cave flooding.\"In addition to Denniston, Villarini, and Gonzales, the other authors on the paper were Karl-Heinz Wyrwoll from the University of Western Australia, Victor J.

Through extensive analysis, they found a major ecosystem reorganization that appeared to be timed with a naturally-occurring climate shift that occurred around 1995.The climate phenomenon is known as the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), a climate signal in the North Atlantic Ocean that switches between cool and warm phases, each lasting for 20-40 years at a time. The AMO, which was in a cool phase between 1965 until 1995 and has been in a warm phase since, influences global ocean and weather conditions in the northern hemisphere such as hurricane activity in the Atlantic ocean and the severity and frequency of droughts.However, the AMO is not as extensively studied as other climate phenomena, such as El Nino, and this study is the first to investigate what scientists hope will be many future studies examining how the AMO influences ecosystem-scale change in the Gulf. Scientists hope this work will spur interest in further studying this phenomenon and its implications for the marine environment in this region.\"These major ecosystem shifts have probably gone unrecognized to date because they are not apparent when considering single species or individual components of the ecosystem,\" said lead investigator Dr. Mandy Karnauskas of NOAA's Southeast Fisheries Science Center. \"Only when we put a lot of things together -- including currents, hypoxia, fish abundances, fishing effort, and more -- does a strong climate signal emerge.\"Additionally, scientists observed shifts in many species around the late 1970s coincident with the advent of the U.S. Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act- a policy designed to set rules for international fishing in U.S. waters, make the expansion of certain fisheries more favorable for economic development, and ensure the long-term sustainability of the nation's fish stocks.Other human influences that are not as pronounced--or easily distinguishable--include coastal development, agricultural runoff, oil spills, and fishing. Natural phenomena like coastal storms and hurricanes play a role as well.The scientists expect their study to be useful to resource managers throughout the Gulf region. While managers cannot control Earth's natural climate cycles, they may need to consider how to alter management strategies in light of them, in order to effectively meet their mandates."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_237", "content": "A new study published in \"85 percent of the most intense hurricanes affecting the U.S. and Canada start off as disturbances in the atmosphere over Western Africa,\" says Prof. Price. \"We found that the larger the area covered by the disturbances, the higher the chance they would develop into hurricanes only one to two weeks later.\"Using data covering 2005-2010, Prof. Price analyzed images of cloud cover taken by geostationary satellites, which orbit Earth at the precise speed of Earth's rotation and take pictures of cloud cover every 15 minutes. This enabled Prof. Price to track the variability in cloud cover blocking Earth's surface in West Africa between the months of June and November -- hurricane season.The coverage of clouds acts as an indication of atmospheric disturbances. The more clouds in an area, the larger the disturbance. Using infrared cloud-top temperature data gathered from satellites, Prof. Price assessed the temperatures of the cloud tops, which grow colder the higher they rise. He then compared his cloud data with hurricane statistics -- intensity, date of generation, location, and maximum winds --from the same period using the National Hurricane Center data base.\"We first showed that the areal coverage of the cold cloud tops in tropical Africa was a good indicator of the monthly number of atmospheric disturbances -- or waves -- leaving the west coast of tropical Africa,\" said Prof. Price. \"The disturbances that developed into tropical storms had a significantly larger area covered by cold cloud tops compared with non-developing waves.\"According to Prof. Price, only 10 percent of the 60 disturbances originating in Africa every year turn into hurricanes. And while there are around 90 hurricanes globally every year, only 10 develop in the Atlantic Ocean.\"We wanted to know what was so special about these 10% of disturbances that develop into hurricanes. Was there something different about these storms at their genesis?\" said Prof. Price. \"By looking at each of these storms individually, we found again that the larger the cloud coverage originally in West Africa, the higher the value of the accumulated cyclone energy in a future hurricane. The conclusion, then, is that the spatial coverage of thunderstorms in West Africa can foretell the intensity of a hurricane a week later.\"If we can predict a hurricane one or two weeks in advance -- the entire lifespan of a hurricane -- imagine how much better prepared cities and towns can be to meet these phenomena head on,\" Prof. Price says. He is currently examining the thunderstorm clusters around the eyes of hurricanes to study the intensification process of those destructive phenomena."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_238", "content": "There are several lines of evidence for an ancient tsunami, foremost a large, wedge-shaped berm about 15 feet above sea level paved with washing machine-sized stones, said the researchers. Set back in places more than a quarter of a mile from shore, the berm stretches for at least 30 miles, alternating between rocky headlands and crescent beaches as it tracks the outline of the Caribbean coast near the plush resorts of Playa del Carmen and Cancun.Radiocarbon dates of peat beneath the extensive berm indicate a tsunami, which may have consisted of two or even three giant waves, likely slammed the coastline sometime after A.D. 450. In addition, ruins of Post-Classic Mayan structures built between A.D. 900 and 1200 were found atop parts of the berm, indicating the tsunami occurred prior to that time.\"I was quite shocked when I first walked these headlands and saw this large berm paved with boulders running long distances in both directions,\" said CEA scientist Charles Shaw. \"My initial thought was that a huge wave came through here in the past, and it must have packed quite a punch.\"A paper on the subject by Shaw and Larry Benson, an adjunct curator of anthropology at the University of Colorado Museum of Natural History, was published online this week in the The boulders that cover the face and top of the berm are composed of coral and fine-grained limestone, said Benson. \"The force required to rip this reef material from the seafloor and deposit it that far above the shoreline had to have been tremendous,\" he said. \"We think the tsunami wave height was at least 15 feet and potentially much higher than that.\"In addition, the researchers have found \"outlier berms,\" spanning some 125 miles along the Yucatan coastline that suggest the tsunami impacted a very large region. \"I think there is a chance this tsunami affected the entire Yucatan coast,\" said Benson.The berm is composed of two layers of coarse sand as well as both small and large boulders. The beaches between the headland areas contain mostly sandy carbonate material with small boulders that likely were eroded from nearby bays during the event, said Shaw.It is not clear what might have caused the tsunami, which can be triggered by a variety of events ranging from earthquakes and underwater landslides to volcanic eruptions and oceanic meteor strikes. While scientists have found evidence a \"super-typhoon\" deposited rocky berms on the Australian coastline, the sediments in those berms occur in well-sorted bands, while the Yucatan berm is composed of coarse, unlayered sands suggesting different processes were involved in sediment deposition.\"If hurricanes can build these types of berms, why is there only a single berm off the Yucatan coast given the numerous hurricanes that have made landfall there over the past century?\" said Shaw. \"That is a big part of our argument for a tsunami wave. We think we have the pieces of evidence we need for this event to have occurred.\"Benson and Shaw suggest the tsunami could be more accurately dated by coring mangrove swamp sediments found along the coast in order to locate the carbonate sand deposited by the massive wave, then radiocarbon dating the peaty material above and below the sand.One implication of the Yucatan tsunami is the potential destruction another one could cause. While the geologic evidence indicates tsunamis in the region are rare -- only 37 recorded in the Caribbean basin since 1492 -- the Yucatan coastline, which was only lightly populated by Mayans 1,500 years ago, is now home to a number of lavish resort communities and villages inhabited by some 1.4 million people.\"If such an event occurs in the future, it would wreak havoc along the built-up coastline, probably with a great loss of life,\" said Benson. But it's far more likely that powerful hurricanes like the Class 5 Hurricane Gilbert that made landfall on the Yucatan Peninsula in 1988, killing 433 people in the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico and causing more than $7 billion in damage, will slam the coastline, said the researchers."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_239", "content": "Researchers at Nova Southeastern University's (NSU) Oceanographic Center have discovered that storms don't only have a dramatic impact on land; they have an equally dramatic effect on ocean currents, which helps the spread of marine invasive species throughout a region. More specifically, NSU researchers looked at the distribution of lionfish in the Florida Straits.\"This is the first-ever study that shows hurricane-altered ocean currents are able not only to help, but actually accelerate the invasion of non-native marine species of any kind,\" said Matthew Johnston, Ph.D., one of the research scientists at NSU's Oceanographic Center who conducted the study. \"Lionfish are pretty sedentary, so this is like creating express lanes on a superhighway -- otherwise, that's a pretty long swim for lionfish babies.\"The research, conducted by Johnston and NSU Oceanographic Center Professor Sam Purkis, Ph.D., focused on the explosion of lionfish populations in area waters. Their findings are being published in the journal Not to be too technical, Johnston said that the research focused on how large storms (i.e. hurricanes) affect the flow of water in the Florida Straits. Normally, the currents represent a potential barrier to the transport of lionfish eggs and larvae across the Florida Straits. The researchers found that as a hurricane passes, the flow of water shifts from a strong, northern flow to a strong, eastern flow.It's these changes in flow direction and speed that likely carry lionfish larvae and eggs from Florida to the Bahamas and can explain how lionfish were able to cross the Gulf Stream so soon after their introduction to South Florida waters.Johnston said that once they were established in the Bahamas, hurricanes allowed lionfish to spread quickly against the normal, northwestern direction of water flow in the area. In addition, the storms helped increase the spread of lionfish by approximately 45% and their population size by 15%.\"The study has broader implications in that global climate change may cause an increase in storm frequency and/or intensity, perhaps further accelerating the spread of marine invasives,\" Johnston said. \"Given that South Florida is a hotspot for marine invasive species, the transport of marine larvae from Florida to the Bahamas on hurricane-altered water flow may become commonplace for invasive and native species alike.\"Johnston indicated this research has two implications. First, we need to make a concerted effort to prevent marine introductions to begin with and second, we must implement vigorous, early-detection programs to remove these invasive species before they become a problem. Now the team wants to take this research concept and study similar situations in the South Pacific where typhoons are common."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_240", "content": "The freely-accessible database of storm surge data has been compiled through the multi-partner, international eSurge project, which was launched in 2011 with the aim of making available observational data to improve the modelling and forecasting of storm surges around the world using advanced techniques and instruments.Coastal altimetry, which provides detailed wave and sea level data in the coastal zone captured by specialist instruments called radar altimeters on board satellites, is at the heart of the project and scientists from NOC have been at the cutting-edge of this technique.Raw data collected from altimeters have been re-processed and collated with wind speed data from scatterometers and sea level measurements from tide gauges, to show the spatial structure of each storm. With eSurge, forecasters and scientists can now download these enhanced data and use them for validating their storm surge models and for mapping future storms more accurately.Dr Paolo Cipollini from NOC explained: \"When a satellite altimeter overpasses the area affected by a surge, it gives us a unique profile of the water surface level from offshore to the coast, as well as concurrent measurements of wave height. This information is extremely useful to validate the surge models used for forecasts. Even when there doesn't happen to be an overpass at surge time, the statistics of sea level that we got from more than 20 years of repeated altimetric observations in the area can still be combined with data from nearby tide gauges to improve the forecasts of the expected surge.\"This is the first time that such a detailed level of storm information has been collated and demonstrated as one comprehensive online resource. Data from around 200 storms spanning more than 10 years is now accessible, including major events such as Hurricane Katrina, which devastated New Orleans in the USA in 2005, Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines -- one of the strongest tropical cyclones ever recorded -- and the major winter storm that caused widespread flooding in the UK in December 2013.The eSurge project, which is funded by the European Space Agency, has also demonstrated the feasibility of offering near-real time data about recent and predicted storms, which can be viewed on the new eSurgeLive web page.Findings of the three year project were presented at a symposium hosted in the Netherlands in January 2015. The partners are now looking at the possibility of extending the project and further developing the eSurge resource into a fully-operational, permanent service in the future.As well as providing and analysing data for the eSurge project, NOC has also played a key role in opening up the findings to a wider global audience. In addition to providing data, scientists at NOC have also helped to build an online storm surge community, which enables scientists, storm modellers and users around the world to be better connected.Head of Marine Physics and Ocean Climate (MPOC) at NOC, Professor Kevin Horsburgh, added: \"Storm surges are a global hazard that pose a threat to thousands of lives, and coastal flood forecasting systems can save lives and protect property. Satellite altimetry methods developed at NOC play a crucial role in helping improve storm surge models and map out regional changes in mean sea level.\"NOC is one of five international organisations involved in the eSurge project, which also includes CGI (UK), the Danish Meteorological Institute (DK), the Coastal and Marine Research Centre (IRL) and the Royal Dutch Meteorological Institute (NL)."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_241", "content": "\"Although lots of people have thought about sea level rise from the ice sheets, we don't really know how fast that will happen,\" said Patrick Applegate, research associate, Penn State's Earth and Environmental Systems Institute.If all the ice in the Greenland Ice Sheet melts, global sea level would rise by about 24 feet. In the last 100 years, sea level in the New York City area has only increased by about one foot. However, storm surges from hurricanes stack on top of this long-term increase, so sea level rise will allow future hurricanes to flood places where people are not ready for or used to flooding. A vivid example occurred during Hurricane Sandy when parts of the New York City subway tunnel system flooded.Greenland might be especially vulnerable to melting because that area of Earth sees about 50 percent more warming than the global average. Arctic sea ice, when it exists, reflects the sun's energy back through the atmosphere, but when the sea ice melts and there is open water, the water absorbs the sun's energy and reradiates it back into the air as heat. Arctic sea ice coverage has decreased over the last few decades, and that decrease will probably continue in the future, leading to accelerated temperature rise over Greenland. Floating ice does not add to sea level, but the Greenland Ice Sheet rests on bedrock that is above sea level.Feedbacks in the climate system cause accelerated temperature rise over the Arctic. Other feedbacks in the Greenland Ice Sheet that contribute to melting include height-melting feedback. A warm year in Greenland causes more melt around the edges of the ice sheet, lowering the surface. The atmosphere is warmer at lower altitudes, so the now lower surface experiences even more melting. This process can lead to accelerated ice melt and sea level rise.Another form of feedback occurs because ice sheets are large masses that want to spread. This spreading can either help preserve the ice sheet by allowing it to adjust to increased temperature or accelerate ice melting by moving ice to lower, warmer, places.\"Many studies of sea level rise don't take into account feedbacks that could cause rapid sea level rise,\" said Applegate. \"We wanted to look at the effects of those feedbacks.\"The researchers looked at two models of the Greenland ice sheet that include some of the important feedbacks. The first model is a three-dimensional ice sheet model. The second model looks at a transect across the island and was developed by Byron Parizek, associate professor of geosciences and mathematics, Penn State Dubois. To run both models, Robert Nicholas, research associate, EESI, estimated how much warming might take place over Greenland using results from global climate models.Both the three-dimensional and transect models showed that the time necessary for ice mass loss from the Greenland ice sheet decreases steeply with increases in temperature. Shorter time scales -- faster melting -- imply faster sea level rise. The interplay between the height-melting feedback and ice flow causes this acceleration.\"Our analysis suggests that the benefits of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, in terms of avoided sea level rise from the Greenland Ice Sheet, may be greatest if emissions reductions begin before large temperature increases have been realized,\" the researchers state in a recent issue of Currently, about a billion people live in areas that would be flooded by a three-foot sea level rise.\"If we are going to do something to mitigate sea-level rise, we need to do it earlier rather than later,\" said Applegate. \"The longer we wait, the more rapidly the changes will take place and the more difficult it will be to change.\""}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_242", "content": "The Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System is scheduled to launch in fall 2016. At the American Geophysical Union Meeting in San Francisco this week, U-M researchers released estimates of how significantly CYGNSS could improve wind speed and storm intensity forecasts.CYGNSS--said like the swan constellation--is a $173-million NASA mission that U-M is leading with Texas-based Southwest Research Institute. Each of its eight observatories is about the size of a microwave oven. That's much smaller than a typical weather satellite, which is about the size of a van.The artificial CYGNSS \"constellation,\" as researchers refer to it, will orbit at tropical, hurricane-belt latitudes. Its coverage will stretch from the 38th parallel north near Delaware's latitude to its counterpart in the south just below Buenos Aires.Because of their arrangement and number, the observatories will be able to measure the same spot on the globe much more often than the weather satellites flying today can. CYGNSS's revisit time will average between four and six hours, and at times, it can be as fast as 12 minutes.Conventional weather satellites only cross over the same point once or twice a day. Meteorologists can use ground-based Doppler radar to help them make predictions about storms near land, but hurricanes, which form over the open ocean, present a tougher problem.\"The rapid refresh CYGNSS will offer is a key element of how we'll be able to improve hurricane forecasts,\" said CYGNSS lead investigator Christopher Ruf, director of the U-M Space Physics Research Lab and professor of atmospheric, oceanic and space sciences.\"CYGNSS gets us the ability to measure things that change fast, like extreme weather. Those are the hardest systems to measure with today's satellites. And because the world is warmer and there's more energy to feed storm systems, there's more likelihood of extreme weather.\"Through simulations, the researchers quantified the improvement CYGNSS could have on storm intensity predictions. They found that for a wind speed forecast that is off by 33 knots, or 38 miles per hour--the average error with current capabilities--CYGNSS could reduce that by 9 knots, or about 10 mph.Considering that the categories of hurricane strength ratchet up, on average, every 20 mph, the accuracy boost is \"a very significant number,\" Ruf said.\"I'd describe the feeling about it as guarded excitement,\" he said. \"It's preliminary and it's all based on models. People will be really excited when we get up there and it works.\"The numbers could also improve as scientists update weather prediction tools to better use the new kind of information that CYGNSS will provide.For people who live in common hurricane or typhoon paths, closer wind speed predictions could translate into more accurate estimates of the storm surge at landfall, Ruf said. That's the main way these systems harm people and property.\"The whole ocean gets higher because the wind pushes the water. That's really hard to forecast now and it's an area we hope to make big improvements in,\" Ruf said.Researchers expect the satellite system to give them new insights into storm processes. Hurricanes evolve slowly at first, but then they reach a tipping point, says Aaron Ridley, a professor of atmospheric, oceanic and space sciences.\"The hurricane could be meandering across the Atlantic Ocean and then something happens.\" Ridley said. \"It kicks up a notch and people aren't exactly sure why. A lot of scientists would like to study this rapid intensification in more detail. With a normal mission, you might not be able to see it, but with CYGNSS, you have a better chance.\"The satellites will operate in a fundamentally different way than their counterparts do. Rather than transmit a signal and read what reflects back, they'll measure how GPS signals from other satellites bounce off the ocean surface. Each of the eight CYGNSS nodes will measure signals from four of the 32 Global Positioning System satellites.They'll also be able to take measurements through heavy rain--something other weather satellites are, surprisingly, not very good at."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_243", "content": "Johns Hopkins engineers created a computer model to predict the increasing vulnerability to hurricanes of power grids in major cities on or relatively near the Atlantic and Gulf coasts. They factored historic hurricane information in with plausible scenarios for future storm behavior, given a global rise in average temperatures. With that data, the team could pinpoint which of 27 cities, from Texas to Maine, will become more susceptible to blackouts caused by future hurricanes.Topping the list of cities most likely to see big increases in their power outage risk are New York; Philadelphia; Jacksonville, Florida; Virginia Beach, Virginia; and Hartford, Connecticut. Cities at the bottom of the list, whose future risk of outages is unlikely to dramatically change, include Memphis, Tennessee; Dallas; Pittsburgh; Atlanta; and Buffalo, New York.Seth Guikema, an associate professor in the university's Department of Geography and Environmental Engineering, said his team's analysis could help metropolitan areas better plan for climate change.Although planning for climate change is difficult due to the high degree of uncertainty about how hurricanes of the future will behave, the team examined a range of potential changes in hurricane activity and quantified how those changes are likely to influence power outage risk. By being able to anticipate these risks, officials have a chance to protect cities against damage and to reinforce their power grids, he said.\"We provide insight into how power systems along the Gulf and Atlantic coasts may be affected by climate changes, including which areas should be most concerned and which ones are unlikely to see substantial change,\" Guikema said. \"If I'm mayor of Miami, we know about hurricanes, we know about outages and our system has been adapted for it. But if I'm mayor of Philadelphia, I might say, 'Whoa; we need to be doing more about this.\"The research appears in the December issue of the journal Climatic Change. Johns Hopkins doctoral student Andrea Staid is the report's lead author.Not surprisingly, the team's results depend strongly on location. If climate change indeed intensifies hurricane activity, some areas of the country would feel the impact of it more than others.Cities already in the eye of the storm like Miami and New Orleans would remain so. But cities like New York and Philadelphia as well as some more inland urban areas would likely be increasingly susceptible to more frequent and intense storm activity, the team found. For both New York City and Philadelphia, the 100-year storm scenario, that is, the level of storm impacts expected to be exceeded on average once every hundred years, would be 50 percent higher. More people would lose power more often, and the worst storms would be substantially worse.In that same type of 100-year storm situation, the researchers predict about a 30 percent increase in the number of customers without power in Miami and New Orleans relative to current climate conditions. In more geographically protected cities like Baltimore and Washington, D.C., there would be about a 20 percent increase in the number of customers without power in the 100-year storm.\"The range of results demonstrates the sensitivity of the U.S. power system to changes in storm behavior,\" Guikema said. \"Infrastructure providers and emergency managers need to plan for hurricanes in a long-term manner and that planning has to take climate change into account.\"The research was funded in part by the National Science Foundation grants 1149460, 1215872, 1331399 and 0968711."}

MIDAS is an administrative database containing hospital records of all patients discharged from non-federal hospitals in New Jersey with a cardiovascular disease diagnosis or invasive cardiovascular procedure.In the two weeks following Hurricane Sandy, the researchers found that in the eight counties determined to be high-impact areas, there was a 22 percent increase in heart attacks as compared with the same time period in the previous five years. In the low impact areas (the remaining 13 counties), the increase was less than one percent. 30-day mortality from heart attacks also increased by 31 percent in the high-impact area.\"We estimate that there were 69 more deaths from myocardial infarction during the two weeks following Sandy than would have been expected. This is a significant increase over typical non-emergency periods,\" said Swerdel. \"Our hope is that the research may be used by the medical community, particularly emergency medical services, to prepare for the change in volume and severity of health incidents during extreme weather events.\"In regard to stroke, the investigators found an increase of 7 percent compared to the same time period in the prior five years in areas of the state impacted the most.

The answer is yes.\"Among the already apparent evidence:â¢ Dunes that historically protected Kennedy Space Center from high seas even during the worst storms were leveled during Tropical Storm Fay in 2008, Hurricane Irene in 2011 and Hurricane Sandy in 2012.â¢ A stretch of beachfront railroad track built by NASA in the early 1960s that runs parallel to the shoreline has been topped by waves repeatedly during recent storms. Though idle now -- one vulnerable section has even been removed to make room for protective humanmade dunes the track serves as a useful yardstick for the Atlantic Ocean's growing incursions. One 2010 NASA report predicts it will be permanently breached by 2016.â¢ After Sandy, one washed-out section of shoreline was so close to a launch pad at adjacent Cape Canaveral Air Force Station that a fence surrounding the pad was left teetering and near collapse.Nancy Bray, director of center operations for Kennedy Space Center, said NASA is taking the situation seriously and has plans for dealing with it. A similar plan has been prepared for NASA's Wallops Island Flight Facility in Virginia, though Wallops has not yet seen the effects that have shown up at Kennedy.\"We do consider sea level rise and climate change to be urgent,\" she said.The research came about after NASA partnered with the U.S. Geological Survey and UF to figure out why chronic erosion was happening along a roughly 6-mile stretch of beach between launch pads 39A and 39B -- the ones used for Space Shuttle and Apollo missions. The problem had been occurring for years but seemed to be growing worse, beginning with the spate of hurricanes that struck Florida in 2004.Jaeger said he, Adams and doctoral students Shaun Kline and Rich Mackenzie determined the cause was a gap in a near-shore sandbar that funnels the sea toward that section of beach. Faced with the question of what was causing the increased vulnerability in that part of the shoreline, they soon came to the conclusion that the culprits were sea-level rise and wave climate change.As for what could be at risk next, the first item on the list is a two-lane road the runs parallel to and slightly inland from the railroad track. Buried beneath it are electrical power lines and pipelines used to transport liquefied gasses.In the short term, NASA has built new dunes to replace the natural ones that were lost on the threatened section of shoreline. Visitors on tour buses can look out over one of the new dunes from an elevated mound on the beach.\"Without that secondary dune line, we could have saltwater intrusion at the launch pad,\" Bray said.Looking further into the future, the agency is taking an approach it calls \"managed retreat.\" That means if sea-level rise becomes insurmountable, Bray said, it may eventually have to move roads, utilities and perhaps even launch pads -- a costly and complex possibility.\"When you put immovable infrastructure right next to a dynamic environment,\" Jaeger said, \"something has to give.\""}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_246", "content": "However, there is a mismatch in both timing and location between this climate disturbance and the Northern Hemisphere hurricane season: El NiÃ±o peaks in winter and its surface ocean warming occurs mostly along the equator, i.e., a season and region without tropical cyclone (TC) activity. This prompted scientists to investigate El NiÃ±o's influence on hurricanes via its remote ability to alter atmospheric conditions such as stability and vertical wind shear rather than the local oceanic environment.Fei-Fei Jin and Julien Boucharel at the UH MÄnoa School of Ocean and Earth Science and Technology (SOEST), and I-I Lin at the National Taiwan University published a paper today in Jin and colleagues uncovered an oceanic pathway that brings El NiÃ±o's heat into the Northeastern Pacific basin two or three seasons after its winter peak - right in time to directly fuel intense hurricanes in that region.El NiÃ±o develops as the equatorial Pacific Ocean builds up a huge amount of heat underneath the surface and it turns into La NiÃ±a when this heat is discharged out of the equatorial region. \"This recharge/discharge of heat makes El NiÃ±o/La NiÃ±a evolve somewhat like a swing,\" said Jin, lead author of the study.Prior to Jin's and colleagues' recent work, researchers had largely ignored the huge accumulation of heat occurring underneath the ocean surface during every El NiÃ±o event as a potential culprit for fueling hurricane activity.\"We did not connect the discharged heat of El NiÃ±o to the fueling of hurricanes until recently, when we noticed another line of active research in the tropical cyclone community that clearly demonstrated that a strong hurricane is able to get its energy not only from the warm surface water, but also by causing warm, deep water - up to 100 meters deep - to upwell to the surface,\" said Jin.Co-author Lin had been studying how heat beneath the ocean surface adds energy to intensify typhoons (tropical cyclones that occur in the western Pacific).\"The super Typhoon Hainan last year, for instance, reached strength way beyond normal category 5,\" said Lin. \"This led to a proposed consideration to extend the scale to category 6, to be able to grasp more properly its intensity. The heat stored underneath the ocean surface can provide additional energy to fuel such extraordinarily intense tropical cyclones.\"\"The Northeastern Pacific is a region normally without abundant subsurface heat,\" said Boucharel, a post-doctoral researcher at SOEST. \"El NiÃ±o's heat discharged into this region provides conditions to generate abnormal amount of intense hurricanes that may threaten Mexico, the southwest of the U.S. and the Hawaiian islands.\"Furthermore, caution the authors, most climate models predict a slowdown of the tropical atmospheric circulation as the mean global climate warms up. This will result in extra heat stored underneath the Northeastern Pacific and thus greatly increase the probability for this region to experience more frequent intense hurricanes.Viewed more optimistically, the authors point out that their findings may provide a skillful method to anticipate the activeness of the coming hurricane season by monitoring the El NiÃ±o conditions two to three seasons ahead of potentially powerful hurricane that may result."}

Perceptions of warmer winter temperatures seemed to track with observed temperatures.\"Those results are promising because we do hope that people accurately perceive the reality that's around them so they can adapt accordingly to the weather,\" McCright said.But when it came to attributing the abnormally warm weather to global warming, respondents largely held fast to their existing beliefs and were not influenced by actual temperatures.As this study and McCright's past research shows, political party identification plays a significant role in determining global warming beliefs. People who identify as Republican tend to doubt the existence of global warming, while Democrats generally believe in it.The abnormally warm winter was just one in an ongoing series of severe weather events -- including the 2010 Russian heat wave, Hurricane Sandy in 2012 and the 2013 typhoon in the Philippines -- that many believed would help start convincing global warming skeptics.\"There's been a lot of talk among climate scientists, politicians and journalists that warmer winters like this would change people's minds,\" McCright said. \"That the more people are exposed to climate change, the more they'll be convinced. This study suggests this is not the case.\""}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_248", "content": "Tropical cyclones, including hurricanes and typhoons, are severe natural disasters that can cause tremendous loss of human life and suffering. Our knowledge of peoples' movements during natural disasters is so far limited due to a lack of data. The authors of this article studied human mobility using movement data from individuals active on Twitter in New York City for 12 days during and after Hurricane Sandy in 2012. They analyzed location data attached to over 700,000 tweets from over 53,000 people and mapped each location during 24-hour periods over the 12 days.The researchers observed that peoples' locations covered nearly the entire mapped area and showed similar geographical and statistical distributions to 24-hour periods soon after the hurricane, including areas subject to mandatory evacuation. These results may indicate that New Yorkers were relatively resilient in terms of human mobility during Hurricane Sandy. While resilience could be vital for the city's post-disaster response and recovery, it may also be dangerous if people are moving through mandated evacuation areas during or immediately following extreme weather events like a hurricane. Understanding nuances of human mobility under the influence of such disasters will enable more effective evacuation, emergency response planning, and development of strategies and policies to minimize human fatality, injury, and economic loss."}

This period, referred to as the Global Warming Hiatus, raised a lot of public and scientific interest. However, as of April 2014 ocean warming has picked up speed again, according to Timmermann's analysis of ocean temperature datasets.\"The 2014 global ocean warming is mostly due to the North Pacific, which has warmed far beyond any recorded value and has shifted hurricane tracks, weakened trade winds, and produced coral bleaching in the Hawaiian Islands,\" explains Timmermann.He describes the events leading up to this upswing as follows: Sea-surface temperatures started to rise unusually quickly in the extratropical North Pacific already in January 2014. A few months later, in April and May, westerly winds pushed a huge amount of very warm water usually stored in the western Pacific along the equator to the eastern Pacific. This warm water has spread along the North American Pacific coast, releasing into the atmosphere enormous amounts of heat--heat that had been locked up in the Western tropical Pacific for nearly a decade.\"Record-breaking greenhouse gas concentrations and anomalously weak North Pacific summer trade winds, which usually cool the ocean surface, have contributed further to the rise in sea surface temperatures. The warm temperatures now extend in a wide swath from just north of Papua New Guinea to the Gulf of Alaska,\" says Timmermann.The current record-breaking temperatures indicate that the 14-year-long pause in ocean warming has come to an end."}

Their research appears in the Gabriele Villarini, UI assistant professor of civil and environmental engineering, studied the discharge records collected at 3,090 U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) stream gauge stations from 1981 to 2011 and found that the effects of North Atlantic tropical cyclones impact large areas of the United States away from Florida, the East Coast and the Gulf Coast.\"When you hear about hurricanes or tropical cyclones you think about storm surges and wind damage near the coast,\" says Villarini, who also conducts research at the IIHR-Hydroscience & Engineering. \"But it's much more than that. Flooding from a single tropical cyclone often impacts 10 to 15 states located hundreds of miles from the coast and covering a wide area.\"Our results indicate that flooding from tropical cyclones affects large areas of the United States and the Midwest, as far inland as Illinois, Wisconsin, and Michigan,\" says Villarini.\"The USGS stream gauges, located east of the Rocky Mountains, showed that tropical cyclones can cause major flooding over the Midwest, including the southeastern corner of Iowa,\" he says.Villarini and his colleagues conducted their study by relating maximum water discharges recorded by USGS stream gauges with the passage of the storms over the Midwest and eastern states. Accordingly, they were able to construct maps for each storm that show the relationship between inland flooding and tropical cyclones.Despite these important impacts, inland tropical cyclone flooding has received little attention in the scientific literature, although the news media have begun to pay more attention following Hurricane Irene in 2011 and Hurricane Sandy in 2012, he says.Villarini says that the amount of financial damage caused by the storms in the Midwest and the eastern United States will be the subject of a future study."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_251", "content": "Dan Work, an assistant professor in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering (CEE) and Brian Donovan, a graduate student in CEE's Sustainable and Resilient Infrastructure Systems program, analyzed GPS data from nearly 700 million taxi trips -- representing four years of taxi travel in New York City -- to determine the city's normal traffic pattern and study the variations during extreme events like the hurricane and snowstorms. The data, routinely recorded by taxi meters, shows travel times and the metered distance for various trips around the city at different times of the day and night. The researchers' method works by computing the historical distribution of pace, or normalized travel times, between various regions of a city and measuring the pace deviations during an unusual event.\"The first step was to figure out from the data what is normal,\" Work said. \"There is a heartbeat pattern to the city every single day. In the middle of the night when traffic is light, you can get from one side of the city to another very quickly, and every morning during rush hour the roads are congested. The data shows us the typical heartbeat, and then we look for the arrhythmia.\"A visualization comparing GPS data from New York City taxis in the days surrounding Hurricane Sandy with the same data under normal traffic conditions.A resilient transportation system is one that can weather an extreme event with only minimal damage or service disruption and bounce back to normal relatively quickly, Work said. When cities know how their traffic systems respond to extreme events, they can examine ways to improve them. For example, an unexpected effect of Hurricane Sandy was that the longest traffic delays occurred as people returned to the city to resume their normal activities immediately after the storm, Work said.\"That was the one surprising piece to us,\" Work said. \"A lot of literature on disasters has been very much focused on how to get people out of the city quickly and safely. It makes sense. But the re-entry process is also important, because you don't want your first responders stuck in gridlock.\"There is still work to be done to translate this research into improved infrastructure resilience, Work said, but now there is a way to quantify the progress at a city scale.\"Importantly, this project shows us that the period immediately following the disaster should be the focus of additional research, with the ultimate goal of enhancing post-disaster transportation management and policy,\" Work said.The researchers obtained the taxi data through a Freedom of Information Law request to the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission, which already collects it routinely. This gives it advantages over traditional methods for monitoring traffic that rely on sensors in the roadway or video cameras; that equipment can be expensive to deploy throughout a city, Work said.\"Although the taxi data isn't primed for traffic monitoring purposes because it is so coarse, with the right processing, you can still see things about the city-scale performance that you would expect to observe from a dense network of traditional traffic sensors,\" Work said.\"One thing that I think is kind of cool about this project,\" Donovan said, \"is that taxis are designed to just get people from point A to point B, but this is a second use for them. The taxis themselves act as sensors to tell you what's going on in the city.\"With 700 million records, the size of the data set creates its own set of challenges. One of Donovan's significant contributions to the project involved optimizing the efficiency of the calculations to speed up the analysis, Work said.\"One of the major challenges when you're dealing with a large data set like this is that you don't want the program to run for 24 hours. In a disaster, that's too long to wait; you need an answer immediately. So you have to design the algorithms appropriately,\" Donovan said.Donovan, who earned his bachelor's degree in computer science, was drawn to the master's program at Illinois because of the opportunity to work on multi-disciplinary projects like this one, he said. The combination of computer science and transportation systems knowledge is the key to the success of a project like this, Work said.\"Our background in transportation engineering helped us choose the dataset, clean it, and determine the performance metrics to study,\" Work said. \"At the same time, we needed the right computational tools to be able to process this much data and turn it into actionable information.A paper on this work, \"Using coarse GPS data to quantify city-scale transportation system resilience to extreme events,\" will be published in the Conference Proceedings of the Transportation Research Board in January 2015.

This information is being used to create sophisticated models which will be used by engineers to better calculate flood risks for different locations.\"In the past, engineers have tended to make decisions as though every flood has just a single cause, for example unusually heavy rainfall or an extreme ocean water level,\" says Dr Seth Westra, Senior Lecturer in the School of Civil, Environmental and Mining Engineering.\"Multiple causes and how they interact have rarely been considered but, ironically, many big floods that have occurred in Australia have been extremely complex, with many different things happening at the same time.\"For instance, Dr Westra says, the devastating Queensland floods of 2011 superficially appeared to be caused by intense rainfall, but the flood wouldn't have had been so large if the catchments hadn't already been waterlogged from a very wet spring.\"Accurate assessment of the risk of floods in any particular area is important for town planning and council zoning and in designing flood protection infrastructure like bridges and levees,\" says Dr Westra.\"But properly understanding the risk of flooding means we have to assess the likelihood of these different events coinciding -- acting together in a synergistic way to cause an extreme flood. For example do you tend to get big storm surges at the same time as heavy rainfall?\"Even when something has never happened in the past, it's possible that the elements could align in a different way in the future to cause a flood event. Think of Hurricane Sandy in the US, which was brought about by the combination of an extremely unusual set of conditions to wreak havoc in New York. We need to be able to assess what sorts of floods can possibly occur in the future, even if we haven't observed or recorded similar events.\"In Australia, this estimation is complicated further by the fact that we don't have great long-term records of flood risk. We're a relatively new country and in a lot of catchments there may only be 30 years of good data -- so we have to make educated guesses as to what might be possible in the future.\"Climate change is adding another dimension to the difficulty of flood risk estimation. \"Under climate change, each risk factor will probably change in the future -- but it will be a complex picture, much more nuanced than is often reported,\" says Dr Westra.\"Certainly some places will see increased floods, but other locations could even see a reduction in flood risk.\""}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_253", "content": "Scientists with the U.S. Geological Survey and Eckerd College recently published research on a newly discovered refuge for reef-building corals in mangrove habitats of the U.S. Virgin Islands. More than 30 species of reef corals were found growing in Hurricane Hole, a mangrove habitat within the Virgin Islands Coral Reef National Monument in St. John.Corals are animals that grow in colonies, forming reefs over time as old corals die and young corals grow upon the calcium carbonate or limestone skeletons of the old corals. Coral reefs make up some of the most biologically diverse habitats on Earth, and face many threats such as coastal pollution, dredging and disease. However, some of their most widespread threats involve warming ocean temperatures, solar radiation and increased ocean acidification.It is from these threats that corals are finding refuge under the red mangroves of Hurricane Hole. Red mangroves, subtropical or tropical trees that colonize coastlines and brackish water habitats, have networks of prop roots that extend down toward the seafloor, and corals are growing on and under these roots.Mangroves and their associated habitats and biological processes protect corals in a variety of ways.Bleaching occurs when corals lose their symbiotic algae. Most corals contain algae called zooxanthellae within their cells. The coral protects the algae, and provides the algae with the compounds they need for photosynthesis. The algae, in turn, produce oxygen, help the coral to remove waste products, and, most importantly, provide the coral with compounds the coral needs for everyday survival. When corals are under prolonged physiological stress, they may expel the algae, leading to the condition called bleaching.When examining corals for this study, researchers found evidence of some species thriving under the mangroves while bleaching in unshaded areas outside of the mangroves. Boulder brain corals, for example, were found in abundance under the mangroves and were healthy, while many of those in unshaded areas a short distance away were bleaching.Organisms throughout the world are threatened as climate and other conditions change. If they can find ways to adapt, as it appears these coral have, they can continue to survive as part of an invaluable piece of this world's intricate ecological puzzle. It is not known how many other mangrove areas in the world harbor such a high diversity of corals, as most people do not look for corals growing in these areas. No coral reefs have been identified to date that protect from rising ocean temperatures, acidification and increased solar radiation like these mangrove habitats in St. John."}

(DSA) -- under a National Science Foundation and Department of Energy grant -- to conduct the trial at Dr. Ellison's home. The team is led by Principal Investigator Dr. Miriam Rafailovich, Distinguished Professor in the Department of Materials Science, and Wayne Gutschow, Vice President of Engineering for Nextek Power Systems. With the help of colleagues at the SBU Advanced Energy Research & Technology Center (AERTC) and SBU engineering students, the group will test the device to identify the minimum amount of storage needed to sustain the home's critical loads during periods when the grid, conventional fossil-fuel generator, and solar power are not available.\"People who depend on mechanical ventilators -- breathing machines -- for survival are severely impacted by prolonged power outages,\" says Dr. Ellison, who is paralyzed from the neck down from a childhood accident. \"Vent-dependent individuals rely on power for their every breath. Technologies like this will have a direct impact on their safety and survival,\" adds Dr. Ellison, who also cofounded the Stony Brook University VENTure think tank, an initiative in which SBU researchers and faculty volunteer time to work on projects and develop ideas for ventilator users.The STAR project began with the 2013 SBU Garcia Summer Research Scholars Program. Research participants included Weida Zhang, a senior chemical and molecular engineering student at Stony Brook, and Alex Tang, a senior at Interlake High School in Bellevue, WA -- who was inspired after a Dr. Ellison lecture about the experience of people on life-support systems during Hurricane Sandy.When the storm made landfall on Long Island in 2012, some 90% of Long Island Power Authority customers lost power at some point in time. For those relying on home-use medical devices, especially life-sustaining equipment, the issue of a backup power source for use during emergencies became a life-threatening vulnerability. This was compounded by the likelihood of equipment failure -- with fuel generators operating continuously over long periods of time -- and the fuel shortages that occurred in the aftermath of the hurricane's havoc. The issue seemed to \"sneak up\" on emergency officials, as better medical treatments and healthcare technologies have helped more people avoid hospitals and institutional settings and remain in their homes.The idea to test a back-up sustainable energy source for individuals who rely on life-saving equipment took hold. Dr. Rafailovich and colleagues thought the opportunity to work with Dr. Ellison with her home as a \"living laboratory\" would be a major step to bring such a technology and device to fruition. The project has become one that drives home the interplay between scientific research, industry, education, engineering, and the ability to make a difference in people's lives.\"It's a pleasure to participate in a venture that brings laboratory research into the home with the help of industrial developers,\" says Dr. Rafailovich. Adds SBU student researcher Zhang, \"Having an opportunity to work with a company on a project with real-world applications is something many students seek but never get.\"About the STAR unit and the field test The STAR unit is composed of six solar panels, two sets of four absorbed glass mat (AGM) batteries, a wattmeter, a Pure Sine inverter, a solar charge controller, and a photometer, assembled into a mobile trailer unit. It is designed to integrate multiple power sources, with smart-sensing electronics to detect grid status and the power available from a distributed network of sources. It will provide continuous charging to an Uninterrupted Power Supply (UPS) that networks into the household grid power and supports critical life-support systems in the home.The field test will hook up the inverter to the targeted loads. The inverter is configured to accept power from a grid source; this allows the unit to charge the batteries when there is no sun. When the grid fails, the circuit will be supported by solar and batteries. If neither solar, battery, or grid is available, a backup fossil-fuel generator will power the house and recharge the batteries. Data logging during the field test will record performance and the viability of the setup.The SBU/industry research team will calculate the best size for the power inverter -- which changes direct current (DC) to alternating current (AC) -- to reduce efficiency loss during the transition from batteries to grid. The researchers will optimize the solar capacity (sizing the panel array to minimize fossil-fuel generator use), the charge controls, and the battery stack. With additional funding, the team will address a next-generation system for Smart Grid applications, and certification for full deployment. Further plans include insertion of SBU invented proprietary fuel-cell enhancement technology and improved lower cost higher performing solar cell technology, slated for commercialization in a new venture (STAR Solutions, Inc.) planned to operate under the Clean Energy Business Incubator Program (CEBIP) and START-UP NY (SUNY Tax-free Areas to Revitalize and Transform Upstate NY) initiative."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_255", "content": "Based on historical records, northwestern Florida gets hit by a  hurricane packing a five-meter (16-foot) storm surge every 400 years.  Incorporating long-term paleohurricane records, the authors find that  the frequency of such a storm is actually closer to every 40 years.When strong storms batter the shore, waves can carry sediment far  inland. Digging down into the sediment record, researchers can reproduce  the occurrence of past storm surge. Using a hurricane model and storm  surge sediment observations, the authors calculated the intensity and  frequency of past hurricanes in Florida's Apalachee Bay. They find that  while the frequency of hurricanes hitting the Gulf Coast has remained  relatively the same over the past few thousand years, the storms'  average intensities have been, at times, much higher than during the  past 160 years.Based on their paleohurricane storm surge observations, the authors  suggest that, historically, northwestern Florida would see a storm surge  of 6.3 meters (20.7 feet) every 100 years, 8.3 meters (27.2 feet) every  500 years, and 11.3 meters (37.1 feet) in a worst case scenario event. A  storm surge of eight meters (26 feet), they say, would push tens of  kilometers inland.The authors suggest that assessments of hurricane risk in other  coastal regions may also be biased by relatively short observational  records, though the direction and magnitude of that bias is not obvious."}

Its data, presented as if it were a curtain hanging from the sky, shows what's in the atmosphere's different layers.From about 60,000 feet on the Global Hawk, twice the altitude of a commercial plane, 94 percent of the atmosphere lies below the instrument. The lidar works by sending rapid pulses of light that, like a radar beam, bounce and scatter off any particles they encounter, such as cloud droplets or dust particles. Some of the scattered light returns to the instrument where it records how long it took for the photons to leave and return -- giving the altitude of the particles.CPL sends out 5,000 pulses of light per second in three different wavelengths, allowing the science team to discriminate between different types of particles, McGill said. \"Is it a cloud made of water? Is it a cloud made of ice or mixed [water and ice]? And we can say something about what type of airborne particle we are seeing.

CPL data have been used to verify model projections of Saharan dust in the tropics. The CPL data showed dust layers had a vertical distribution different than models predicted. Instead dust layers occupied narrower altitude ranges. The finding led to an improvement in the dust models, which then feed into hurricane models.Situated in the nose of the Global Hawk flying over the storm environment, CPL also has a role in on-the-fly mission planning. While in flight, the CPL sends its data back to the team on the ground. \"The mission scientists involved in the flight planning can sit there and watch the data with us in real time and say, 'Oh, we're not getting what we want.'

Over the years CPL has been used as a satellite simulator for ground validation efforts, a cloud spotter for other instruments needing a clear view of the ground, as well as the main data collector for scientists studying atmospheric composition and Earth's energy budget where thin clouds and aerosols are major players. The lidar was also part of the proof of concept flights for the A-Train, a series of satellites flying in the same orbit making near-simultaneous measurements of the Earth system using many different instruments.

Worries about the untested Global Hawk led to a second nearly identical instrument being built for use on the unmanned aircraft. It flew on NASA's maiden Global Hawk Pacific campaign in 2009. Since then, the Global Hawk CPL has flown in two multi-year campaigns, alternating between the Airborne Tropical Tropopause Experiment (ATTREX) and HS3.Compact and fully autonomous, the CPL lidar design pioneered photon-counting technology that has led to the development of two instruments that will fly in space, the Cloud-Aerosol Transport System (CATS), which launches to the International Space Station this December, and the Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System (ATLAS), which will fly on the Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) scheduled to launch in 2017.The solid design of the instrument has borne up surprisingly well over the years, said McGill, who uses CPL as a learning tool for interns and young scientists getting their hands dirty in the field.

This kinetic energy metric is related to the overall size and strength of a storm, not just the maximum wind speed. Predictions of this metric complement existing forecasting tools, potentially allowing forecasters to better assess the risk of hurricanes that make landfall.\"We don't perceive this to be an alternative to how storms are explained to the public, but a complement,\" Misra said.Hurricane forecasts have traditionally focused on wind speeds as measured through the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale. For example, a storm that has wind speeds of 74 to 95 miles per hour would be called a Category 1 storm. A hurricane with wind speeds of 157 miles per hour or higher would be listed as a Category 5.However, some of the most destructive hurricanes to hit the United States have been labeled a Category 1 or Category 2 because of their slower wind speeds.Hurricane Ike, for example, was a category two storm when it made landfall in 2008, meaning it had maximum sustained winds of 96 to 110 miles per hour. Despite the modest rating on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale, Hurricane Ike caused widespread destruction because it was such a large storm.\"When the National Hurricane Center says Category 1, the attitude by the public is that it's fine and they can live through it,\" Misra said. \"But, the damage by flooding is typically more widespread in larger storms.\"Added Kozar: \"It's the wind that gets all the attention, but it's the flooding that causes much of the damage.\"Kozar and Misra's work thus far has focused on using data on storms dating back to 1990. The next step in their research is to focus on real-time weather prediction, so they can show the model in action.The research is supported by funding from NOAA and the U.S. Department of Agriculture."}

The study identified multiple challenges associated with the post-evacuation deployment to other area hospitals.\"We found that more than half of the deployed nurses surveyed (54%) characterized their deployment as extremely or very stressful, and many of these nurses remained on these interim assignments for up to two months,\" said lead author Nancy Van Devanter, DrPH, RN, EdM, FAAN, an associate professor at NYUCN specializing in health services research.The qualitative interviews revealed several psychosocial and practice-based challenges including: working in an unfamiliar environment; limited orientation time; legal concerns; and issues related to assignments. Only 30% of nurses surveyed thought they received a \"sufficient\" orientation to the host hospital. Further complicating matters, several nurses described situations where they were assigned to more patients than they felt they could safely care for.\"We saw that the immediacy of the natural disaster limited opportunities for host hospitals to provide deployed nurses with a comprehensive orientation,\" said Christine T. Kovner, PhD, RN, FAAN, study co-author and NYUCN professor. \"This caused the nurses a great deal of stress and concern over a lack of familiarity with the host hospital's documentation systems, equipment, policies, and procedures.\"While the separation from their co-workers was also a significant stressor for the nurses, the researchers noted that the nurses made specific efforts to keep in touch during the deployment period. One participant elaborated on the extent of their communication during that time saying, \"I talked to my coworkers on the phone more in those three months than I talked to them on the phone in almost five years that I've worked here.\"\"Another aim of our research was to identify resources that helped nurses deal with their stress during the ordeal,\" said co-author Victoria H. Raveis, MA, MPhil, PhD, research professor and director, Psychosocial Research Unit on Health, Aging and the Community at NYUCD. \"The study showed that peer support served as a major mode of stress reduction. Almost every participant in the qualitative study touched upon the importance of the support their NYULMC peers provided in adjusting to the deployment experience.\"The researchers also found that support from NYULMC supervisors helped alleviate the deployed nurses' stress. Because nurse managers had no formal role once their nurses were deployed, they developed creative advocacy and communication strategies to provide needed support for their staff.The researchers' findings will be used to inform policies that facilitate in future disaster response supporting skilled nurses' participation in deployment in a more effective and meaningful way.\"Our findings will allow us to advocate for the establishment of formal structures to enhance opportunities for nurses deployed during disasters to interact and work with some of their peers, especially when it is not possible to deploy intact teams to host hospitals,\" said Van Devanter.The authors of this study cite the need for further research to identify challenges experienced by nurses from the host hospitals and from the other hospitals that were evacuated as a result of Hurricane Sandy, adding that such research could further inform regional and national planning, procedure, and policy development to facilitate deployment and address patient surge for future disasters."}

Though one hour later, vigorous lightning flashed in the vicinity of the Island of Hawaii as Flossie approached. Further, as volcanic emissions were wrapped into this moist environment, sulfate aerosols promoted the formation of a greater number of smaller than normal cloud droplets, which favored charge separation in the upper cloud region and the occurrence of lightning.Sulfate aerosols have previously been identified as a principal component of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN), a necessary ingredient for forming raindrops. But, said Businger, \"This is the first interaction between an active, vigorously degassing volcano and a tropical cyclone captured by a vog model run over the Hawaiian Islands -- providing a unique opportunity to analyze the influence of robust volcanic emissions entrained into a tropical storm system.\"Taken together, the observations and the vog model highlight an intimate interaction between Tropical Storm Flossie and Kilauea's vog plume during the passage of the storm. The observations of Flossie's changing dynamics as it encountered Kilauea's vog has implications for the impact on hurricanes of polluted air as they approach the US mainland coast.\"The Hawaiian Islands provide a unique environment to study this interaction in relative isolation from other influences,\" according to Businger. He plans to model the interaction of the vog plume and Hurricane Flossie with a more complex model that integrates chemistry into the predictions to better understand the processes at work in this unique confluence."}

This is thanks to tremendous advancements in computer and satellite technology. While we still have the \"cone of uncertainty\" we've become familiar with watching television weather reports, today's models are more accurate than they used to be.The one area, however, where there is still much more to be researched and learned is in predicting just how intense a storm may be. While hurricane hunter aircraft can help determine wind speed, velocity, water temperature and other data, the fact is we often don't know But, thanks to new research being conducted, all that's about to change.\"The air-water interface -- whether it had significant waves or significant spray -- is a big factor in storm intensity,\" said Alex Soloviev, Ph.D., a professor at Nova Southeastern University's Oceanographic Center. \"Hurricanes gain heat energy through the interface and they lose mechanical energy at the interface.\"Soloviev is also an Adjunct Professor at the University of Miami Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science (UM RSMAS) and a Fellow at the Cooperative Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Studies (CIMAS.) He and his fellow researchers used a computational fluid dynamics model to simulate microstructure of the air-sea interface under hurricane force winds. In order to verify these computer-generated results, the group conducted experiments at the UM's Rosenstiel School Air-Sea Interaction Salt Water Tank (ASIST) where they simulated wind speed and ocean surface conditions found during hurricanes.The study \"The Air-Sea Interface and Surface Stress Under Tropical Cyclones\" was published in the June 16, 2014 issue of the journal The researchers were surprised at what they found. Under hurricane force wind, the air-water interface was producing projectiles fragmenting into sub millimeter scale water droplets. This process is known from some engineering applications, including rocket science, as the Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instability. This new study then looked at how changes in microphysics of the air-sea interface can make a storm grow or weaken in intensity. With wind speed exceeding a Category 1 threshold, the ocean surface unexpectedly became more \"slippery.\"When the wind exceeded Category 3 hurricane force, the \"slippery\" effect started gradually disappearing and was completely gone at Category 5. The conclusion was that some hurricanes might rapidly intensify to Category 3 and then stay in a \"comfortable\" zone around Category 3 status. This finding is consistent with the global best-track tropical cyclone statistics on maximum intensity for 1982-2009. So far, these early results showed that physical conditions where the air and the ocean interact must be a vital part of any successful hurricane forecasting model and would help explain, and predict, how a storm might intensify as it moves through across the water based on the physical stress at the ocean's surface.This work has been supported by the NOPP project \"Advanced coupled atmosphere-wave-ocean modeling for improving tropical cyclone prediction models\" (PIs: Isaac Ginis, URI and Shuyi Chen, UM) and by the Gulf of Mexico Research Initiative (GoMRI) Consortium for Advanced Research on the Transport of Hydrocarbons in the Environment -- CARTHE (PI: Tamay ÃzgÃ¶kmen, UM). GoMRI is a 10-year, $500 million independent research program established by an agreement between BP and the Gulf of Mexico Alliance.The plan is for the team to continue their research and experiments at UM's Alfred C. Glassell, Jr. SUSTAIN facility, which has recently been designed by one of the \"We've got more work to do, but this is a great first step,\" Soloviev said. \"But remember, no matter how good we get in predicting a storm's intensity, people in the path need to prepare accordingly regardless of what Category it is -- that's most important.\""}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_262", "content": "One of the NASA Global Hawks will cover the storm environment and the other will analyze inner-storm conditions. HIRAD will fly aboard the inner-storm Global Hawk and will be positioned at the bottom, rear section of the aircraft.\"HIRAD's purpose is to map out where the strongest winds are in a hurricane. During its first deployment in 2010 for the GRIP airborne campaign, HIRAD had two interesting hurricane cases, Earl and Karl,\" said Daniel J. Cecil, the principal investigator for the HIRAD instrument at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center, Huntsville, Alabama. \"We have made improvements to the instrument since then, and are looking forward to the next good case -- out over water, avoiding land of course!\"HIRAD is a passive microwave radiometer that was developed at NASA Marshall. A radiometer is an instrument used to measure the power of electromagnetic radiation. Because HIRAD is a passive microwave radiometer it detects microwave radiation naturally emitted by Earth. The radiation HIRAD detects is then used to infer wind speed at the surface of an ocean.The antenna on HIRAD makes measurements of microwaves emitted by the ocean surface that are increased by the storm. As winds move across the surface of the sea they generate white, frothy foam. This sea foam causes the ocean surface to emit increasingly large amounts of microwave radiation, similar in frequency or wavelength, but much lower intensity, to that generated within a typical home microwave oven. HIRAD measures that microwave energy and, in doing so, allows scientists to deduce how powerfully the wind is blowing. With HIRAD's unique capabilities, the two-dimensional structure of the surface wind speed field can be much more accurately determined than current operational capabilities allow.HIRAD provides unique observations of sea surface wind speed, temperature and rain. The data HIRAD gathers will advance understanding and predictability of hurricane intensity. HIRAD's data will also help better determine maximum wind speed and structure of the vortex (spinning center). The region of strongest winds are also much better observed with HIRAD than current capabilities.When HIRAD makes cross track scan, it reads a swath of passive microwave radiation emitted from Earth. HIRAD obtains measurements of rain rates and hurricane-strength winds, even through heavy rain. HIRAD measures rain rates ranging from ~ 5 to 100 millimeters per hour (0.2 to 3.9 inches per hour) and wind speeds ranging from ~10 to 85 meters per second (22.3 to 190.1 miles per hour / 36 to 306 kilometers per hour).The HIRAD instrument provides \"brightness temperature data\" that is color-coded by the HIRAD team at NASA Marshall. That color-coded data shows areas of falling rain and possible moderate-to-strong surface winds.HIRAD flew aboard a Global Hawk in the 2013 HS3 mission. On Sept. 15, 2013, the HIRAD instrument scanned Hurricane Ingrid from its perch on the NASA Global Hawk. \"HIRAD data definitely saw most of the strong wind and heavy rain on the northern and eastern sides of Hurricane Ingrid in the area generally near 23 degrees north latitude and 95 degrees west longitude,\" Cecil said.NASA's HS3 mission is a collaborative effort that brings together several NASA centers with federal and university partners to investigate the processes that underlie hurricane formation and intensity change in the Atlantic Ocean basin. The 2014 flights from NASA's Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia will take place between Aug. 26 and Sept. 29 during the peak of the Atlantic hurricane season that runs from June 1 to Nov. 30.The HS3 mission is funded by NASA Headquarters and overseen by NASA's Earth System Science Pathfinder Program at NASA's Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia, and is one of five large field campaigns operating under the Earth Venture program. The HS3 mission also involves collaborations with partners including the National Centers for Environmental Prediction, Naval Postgraduate School, Naval Research Laboratory, NOAA's Hurricane Research Division and Earth System Research Laboratory, Northrop Grumman Space Technology, National Center for Atmospheric Research, State University of New York at Albany, University of Maryland -- Baltimore County, University of Wisconsin, and University of Utah.For more information on HIRAD, visit: For a story about HIRAD data from 2013's Hurricane Ingrid, visit:"}

When several factors (e.g., El NiÃ±o years, hurricane remnants, lifting mechanisms (e.g., orography, cold fronts, jets, and differential heating from land cover contrast), and weather pattern phase-lock) work in synergy in a region, extreme precipitation may occur.Using a multiple-phase scalable and extensible geofluid model, the author considered geological features of the region, as well as an earthquake, drought, deforestation, and topsoil erosion before the triggering storm. Previously, drought conditions created cracks and crevices in the surface; these cracks and crevices were deepened by the 2008 Another key factor in setting up the conditions for the landslide was human-induced deforestation and topsoil erosion, the study found.

The researchers used a technique called \"shadow imaging,\" where a guided laser is sent through the two fluids -- air and water -- to measure the physical properties of the ocean's surface during extreme winds, equivalent to a category-3 hurricane.Using the data obtained from the laboratory experiments conducted with the support of the Gulf of Mexico Research Initiative (GOMRI) through the CARTHE Consortium, the researchers then developed numerical simulations to show that changes in the physical stress at the ocean surface at hurricane force wind speeds may explain the rapid intensification of some tropical storms. The research team's experimental simulations show that the type of instability, known as Kelvin-Helmoltz instability, could explain this intensification.Haus and colleagues will conduct further studies on hurricane intensity prediction in the new, one-of-a- kind Alfred C. Glassell, Jr., SUSTAIN research facility located at the UM Rosenstiel School. The SUrge-STructure-Atmosphere INteraction laboratory is the only facility capable of creating category- 5 level hurricanes in a controlled, seawater laboratory.

The Core Observatory was launched Feb. 27 from Japan and began its prime mission on May 29, just in time for the hurricane season.The five GPM passes over Arthur are the first time a precipitation-measuring satellite has been able to follow a hurricane through its full life cycle with high-resolution measurements of rain and ice. In the July 3 image, Arthur was just off the coast of South Carolina. GPM data showed that the hurricane was asymmetrical, with spiral arms, called rain bands, on the eastern side of the storm but not on the western side.Arthur was born as the first 2014 Atlantic tropical depression on June 30. It strengthened into a tropical storm on July 1 and reached maximum intensity as a Category 2 hurricane on July 4. The storm moved up the U.S. East Coast and made landfall on July 3 at 11:15 p.m. EDT over the Shackleford Banks between Cape Lookout and Beaufort, North Carolina, before swinging northeast over the ocean toward Greenland, where it became an extra-tropical storm on July 5.\"With these new observations we are able to see fine scale structures of precipitation to about 1,000 feet vertically and 3 miles horizontally. This allows us to measure precipitation regionally and to improve weather forecasting models,\" said Gail Skofronick-Jackson, GPM project scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt Maryland.The GPM Core Observatory's observations of storms like Arthur will also help scientists decipher some of the thorniest questions about hurricanes, such as how and why they intensify. Hurricane intensity is one of the most difficult aspects to predict and is an area of active research that GPM's observations will contribute to, said NASA Goddard hurricane researcher Scott Braun.The spacecraft carries two instruments that show the location and intensity of the rain, which defines a crucial part of the storm structure. The GPM Microwave Imager sees through the tops of clouds to observe how much and where precipitation occurs, and the Dual-frequency Precipitation Radar observes precise details of precipitation in three dimensions.With the added capability and higher resolution on the new instruments, \"hurricane features pop out more. They're sharper, there's more clarity to the structures,\" said Braun. \"Being able to see the structures more clearly may allow for better determination of the structure of the eye wall and rainbands, thereby providing clues about the likelihood of a storm intensifying or weakening.\"For forecasters, GPM's radiometer and radar data are part of the toolbox of satellite data that they use to monitor tropical cyclones and hurricanes. This toolbox includes data from other low Earth orbit and geostationary satellites.\"The whole idea here is to use these tools to understand the initial genesis of the tropical cyclone, then to monitor its location, eye structure and intensity as it evolves, and to use that along with our numerical model forecast to generate a five- to seven-day forecast every six hours,\" said Jeff Hawkins, head of the Satellite Meteorological Applications Section for the Naval Research Laboratory in Monterey, California. His group is an early adopter of GPM data and monitors near-real time tropical cyclones worldwide. They distribute satellite products generated from multiple satellites' data to operational and research users, including the Navy and Air Force's Joint Typhoon Warning Center in Hawaii and the U.S. National Hurricane Center in Florida.The addition of GPM data to the current suite of satellite data is timely. Its predecessor precipitation satellite, the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission, is in the17th year of its operation. GPM's new high-resolution microwave imager data and the unique radar data ensure that forecasters and modelers won't have a gap in coverage.All GPM data products will be released to the public by Sept. 2, 2014.

{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_266", "content": "In a few months, NASA will send an ocean wind-monitoring instrument to a berth on the International Space Station. That unique vantage point will give ISS-RapidScat, short for the International Space Station Rapid Scatterometer, the ability to observe daily (also called diurnal) cycles of wind created by solar heat.Winds contribute to motion in the ocean on every scale, from individual waves to currents extending thousands of miles. They affect local weather as well as large-scale, long-term climate patterns such as El NiÃ±o. Across the tropical Pacific, winds help or hinder local economies by allowing nutrient-rich water to well up from the ocean depths, nourishing marine life to the benefit of coastal fisheries, or blocking its upwelling.Since the hours of daylight are totally predictable, you might expect their influence on winds to be equally obvious. But that's not the case. According to Sarah Gille, an oceanographer at Scripps Institution of Oceanography, San Diego, \"There's an enormous amount of diurnal wind variation between 30 degrees north and south of the equator, and we don't understand the timing. It's clear that the winds aren't just triggered every day at noon [when the sun is highest].\"Scatterometer observations from satellites have proven invaluable for understanding ocean winds. A scatterometer is a type of radar that bounces microwaves off Earth's surface and measures the strength and direction of return signals. The more uneven the surface, the stronger the return signals. On the ocean, higher winds create larger waves and therefore stronger return signals. The return signal also tells scientists the direction of the wind, because waves line up in the direction the wind is blowing.The reason spaceborne scatterometers haven't helped much with the specific question of daily wind cycles has to do with their orbits. All modern instruments have been in sun-synchronous orbits, in which a satellite is always oriented at the same angle relative to the sun. In this type of orbit, a satellite passes over every location at the same fixed times, for example, 6 a.m. and 6 p.m. over the equator. The resulting data can't throw much light on the question of how winds develop over the course of a day.For six months in 2003, there were two scatterometers of the same type in space, collecting data at different times of day. From that data, Gille and her colleagues were able to recognize some patterns. \"We could see, for example, how sea breezes converge over a large body of water like the Mediterranean or Black Sea. It was a nice window into diurnal variability, but we only had six months of data.\" That's inadequate to observe differences between summer and winter patterns, among other things.In its berth on the space station, the two-year RapidScat mission, built and managed by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California, will be the first modern spaceborne scatterometer not locked in a sun-synchronous orbit. Each time the space station passes over a spot on Earth, it's at a different time of day than on the previous visit.RapidScat came into being because in 2009, NASA's previous scatterometer mission, an instrument called SeaWinds on the QuikScat satellite, stopped collecting ocean wind data following more than a decade of faithful service. Its antenna rotation mechanism wore out and stopped working. While the SeaWinds instrument itself is still functioning, its view is limited to a very narrow beam.During QuikScat's decade of full operation, the National Weather Service, National Hurricane Center, U.S. Navy, and other users relied on its data (among other data sources) to produce forecasts and warnings of everything from El NiÃ±o to hurricanes to iceberg movements. \"When QuikScat stopped spinning, the user community began looking at ways to get a scatterometer going again,\" said Stacey Boland, a RapidScat project systems engineer at JPL.In 2012, NASA's space station program manager offered scientists at JPL a berth for a replacement scatterometer and a free ride into space in 2014 on a scheduled commercial cargo mission to resupply the space station. \"The community had extensively evaluated many types of opportunities and was well aware of the benefit of the space station orbit,\" Boland said.The entire instrument has been designed and built in the two years since then -- hence the adjective \"Rapid\" in its name. RapidScat's instrument is essentially the same as the durable SeaWinds instrument on QuikScat. RapidScat will give QuikScat's user community the same vital data, and eventually it will supply the long-awaited answers on diurnal winds.Boland explained how the RapidScat data will accumulate to provide those answers. \"We get near-complete spatial coverage every two days over the range of latitudes observable from the space station.\" (The station orbit ranges from 51.6 degrees north to 51.6 degrees south.) \"The coverage at any particular spot is at a slightly different local time of day on each orbit. In about two months, we will have sampled 24 hours of local time at each spot.\"Once RapidScat has gathered enough cycles of observations, Gille said, \"When we average the data, it will tell us what the average conditions are and how much of the observed wind looks like a diurnal pattern.\"Gille added, \"We're very interested in putting time into an analysis to understand how diurnal winds change from season to season or year to year. Understanding the variability of these processes is a critical part of understanding weather.\"For more information about ISS-RapidScat, visit: RapidScat is the third of five NASA Earth science missions scheduled to be launched this year, the most new NASA Earth-observing mission launches in the same year in more than a decade.

The devastating storm hit a week before Election Day, killing hundreds and causing more than $50 billion worth of damage.But a new study examining the psychological impact of Sandy on people's voting intentions indicate the storm's influence was basically a washout.\"Results suggest that immediately following positive news coverage of Obama's handling of the storm's aftermath, Sandy positively influenced attitudes toward Obama, but that by Election Day, reminders of the hurricane became a drag instead of a boon for the president, despite a popular storyline to the contrary,\" said Joshua Hart, assistant professor of psychology and the study's author.The study appears in the June/July issue of Two days after Hurricane Sandy made landfall Oct. 29, Hart began surveying likely voters when it became apparent the storm could impact the bitterly contested race between Obama and Romney.Over the course of a week, the nearly 700 voters polled were asked about their exposure to the storm and related media coverage, as well as their voting intentions. Hart randomly assigned around half of each day's sample to think about the hurricane before reporting their voting intentions, so he could compare preference for Obama versus Romney between voters who had been thinking about the storm, and those who had not.Prior to the positive news coverage for Obama on Oct. 31, there was no influence of Sandy reminders on Obama's vote share. This was also true on Nov. 1, the day after his well-publicized embrace with New Jersey Republican Gov. Chris Christie while touring the hard-hit Jersey Shore. It was that appearance in particular that angered Romney supporters since Christie was a Romney surrogate.Obama did receive a slight bump in support from study participants on Nov. 2 and 3 who thought about Sandy before reporting their voting intentions, but by Election Day, this trend reversed, when news coverage of the storm shifted and became more negative, focusing on loss of life, lingering damage and power outages.\"The data suggest that people going to the polls Nov. 6 with the hurricane on their mind would have been less inclined to vote for Obama,\" Hart said.Still, that didn't stop a number of pundits from speculating that the storm was a critical factor in Romney's loss by slowing his momentum, despite polling evidence to the contrary. In winning 26 states and collecting 332 electoral votes, Obama received 51.1 percent of the popular vote to Romney's 47.2 percent.Shortly after the election, Romney insisted Sandy played no role in his defeat.\"I don't think that's why the president won the election,\" Romney told Fox News, instead blaming his own \"47 percent\" comments and his inability to connect with minority voters.Six months later, Romney changed his tune.\"I wish the hurricane hadn't have happened when it did because it gave the president a chance to be presidential and to be out showing sympathy for folks,\" Romney told CNN.Hart said his study doesn't reflect the whole of the story on Sandy's effect in the 2012 race, but that the results say more about the pundits than the voters.\"What it says about voters, perhaps, is that it can be difficult to predict or intuit exactly how they are going to process something like Sandy,\" he said.\"It depends on a number of variables and the effect may change over even shorter stretches of time. Yet pundits tend to seize on certain 'laws' such as presiding over a disaster makes an incumbent look presidential. But each event like Sandy deserves to be studied as a unique occurrence to help answer questions about the impact of unpredictable, large-scale events as they unfold.\"In trying to determine whether or how an event affects elections, Hart says that it is important to use experimental approaches to test the influence of \"priming,\" or activating thoughts of different topics, on voters' attitudes, in addition to more traditional polling methodology."}

It blends documentary and reality style in encounters with the silliness of environmental extremism and the seriousness of Hurricane Katrina.An Inconvenient Truth directed by Davis Guggenheim documents Al Gore's campaign to get the issue of global warming recognized internationally.All three films had their critics.

But Tang and colleagues found both energy production (photosynthesis) and energy consumption (respiration) decrease with age, resulting in an overall decrease in growth rates.\"Forests are also big carbon sinks that offset, in part, human-induced carbon emissions.

As a result, people in the path of these severe storms may take fewer protective measures, leaving them more vulnerable to harm.The finding indicates an unfortunate and unintended consequence of the gendered naming of hurricanes, which has important implications for policymakers, meteorologists, the news media and the public regarding hurricane communication and preparedness, the researchers say.\"The problem is that a hurricane's name has nothing to do with its severity,\" said Kiju Jung, a doctoral student in marketing in the U. of I.'s College of Business and the lead author on the study.\"Names are assigned arbitrarily, based on a predetermined list of alternating male and female names,\" he said. \"If people in the path of a severe storm are judging the risk based on the storm's name, then this is potentially very dangerous.\"The research, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, examined actual hurricane fatalities for all storms that made landfall in the U.S. from 1950-2012, excluding Hurricane Katrina (2005) and Hurricane Audrey (1957) because they were much deadlier than the typical storm.The authors found that for highly damaging storms, the more feminine the storm's name, the more people it killed. The team's analysis suggests that changing a severe hurricane's name from the masculine \"Charley\" to the feminine \"Eloise\" could nearly triple its death toll.\"In judging the intensity of a storm, people appear to be applying their beliefs about how men and women behave,\" said Sharon Shavitt, a professor of marketing at Illinois and a co-author of the report. \"This makes a female-named hurricane, especially one with a very feminine name such as Belle or Cindy, seem gentler and less violent.\"In a follow-up set of experiments, Jung and his colleagues examined how the gender of names directly affected people's judgments about storms. They found that people who were asked to imagine being in the path of \"Hurricane Alexandra\" (or \"Christina\" or \"Victoria\") rated the storm as less risky and intense compared to those asked to imagine being in the path of \"Hurricane Alexander\" (or \"Christopher\" or \"Victor\").\"This is a tremendously important finding. Proof positive that our culturally grounded associations steer our steps,\" said Hazel Rose Markus, a professor in behavioral sciences at Stanford University, who was not involved in the research.Hurricanes in the U.S. formerly were given only female names, a practice that meteorologists of a different era considered appropriate given the unpredictable nature of the storms. According to the paper, an alternating male-female naming system was adopted in the late 1970s because of increased societal awareness of sexism.(The names of this year's storms, alternating between male and female names, will start with Arthur, Bertha, Cristobal and Dolly.)Even though the \"gender\" of hurricanes is pre-assigned and arbitrary, the question remains: Do people judge hurricane risks in the context of gender-based expectations?\"People imagining a 'female' hurricane were not as willing to seek shelter,\" Shavitt said. \"The stereotypes that underlie these judgments are subtle and not necessarily hostile toward women -- they may involve viewing women as warmer and less aggressive than men.\"\"Such gender biases are pervasive and implicit,\" said Madhu Viswanathan, a professor of marketing at Illinois and a co-author of the study. \"We found that people were affected by the gender of hurricane names regardless of whether they explicitly endorsed the idea that women and men have different traits. This appears to be a widespread phenomenon.\"Hurricanes kill more than 200 people in the U.S. each year, and severe hurricanes are capable of producing casualties in the thousands, according to the paper. Even with climate change increasing the frequency and severity of storms, hurricane preparedness remains a challenge for officials.Although the negative effect of gender stereotypes is well-known in hiring decisions and other evaluations of women and men, this research is the first to demonstrate that gender stereotypes can have deadly consequences."}

HS3 is a collaborative effort that brings together several NASA centers with federal and university partners to investigate the processes that underlie hurricane formation and intensity change in the Atlantic Ocean basin. The flights from Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia take place between Aug. 26 and Sept. 29, during the peak of the Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from June 1 to Nov. 30.The NASA Global Hawks are unmanned aircraft that will be piloted remotely from the HS3 mission control at NASA's Wallops Flight Facility. Global Hawk aircraft are well suited for hurricane investigations because they can fly for as long as 26 hours and fly above hurricanes at altitudes greater than 55,000 feet.One Global Hawk will focus on the inner region of the storms to measure wind, precipitation, temperature and humidity. It will carry three instruments, including the High-Altitude Monolithic Microwave Integrated Circuit Sounding Radiometer (HAMSR) microwave sounder, developed at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California. The second Global Hawk will carry three different instruments and examine the environment around the storms.The NASA-Japanese Space Agency Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission, launched Feb. 27, will provide rainfall measurements every three hours around the globe, and will complement the HS3 mission.The ISS-RapidScat instrument, managed by JPL, is slated for launch to the International Space Station in August. RapidScat will measure ocean surface winds in Earth's tropics and mid-latitudes and will provide useful data for weather forecasting of marine storms.GPM and RapidScat are two of five NASA Earth science missions scheduled to be launched this year, the most new NASA Earth-observing mission launches in the same year in more than a decade. NASA monitors Earth's vital signs from land, air and space with a fleet of satellites and ambitious airborne and ground-based observation campaigns. NASA develops new ways to observe and study Earth's interconnected natural systems with long-term data records and computer analysis tools to better see how our planet is changing.

{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_272", "content": "The main driver of this year's outlook is the anticipated development of El NiÃ±o this summer. El NiÃ±o causes stronger wind shear, which reduces the number and intensity of tropical storms and hurricanes. El NiÃ±o can also strengthen the trade winds and increase the atmospheric stability across the tropical Atlantic, making it more difficult for cloud systems coming off of Africa to intensify into tropical storms.The outlook calls for a 50 percent chance of a below-normal season, a 40 percent chance of a near-normal season, and only a 10 percent chance of an above-normal season. For the six-month hurricane season, which begins June 1, NOAA predicts a 70 percent likelihood of 8 to 13 named storms (winds of 39 mph or higher), of which 3 to 6 could become hurricanes (winds of 74 mph or higher), including 1 to 2 major hurricanes (Category 3, 4 or 5; winds of 111 mph or higher).These numbers are near or below the seasonal averages of 12 named storms, six hurricanes and three major hurricanes, based on the average from 1981 to 2010. The Atlantic hurricane region includes the North Atlantic Ocean, Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico.\"Thanks to the environmental intelligence from NOAA's network of earth observations, our scientists and meteorologists can provide life-saving products like our new storm surge threat map and our hurricane forecasts,\" said Kathryn Sullivan, Ph.D., NOAA administrator. \"And even though we expect El NiÃ±o to suppress the number of storms this season, it's important to remember it takes only one land falling storm to cause a disaster.\"Gerry Bell, Ph.D., lead seasonal hurricane forecaster with NOAA's Climate Prediction Center, said the Atlantic -- which has seen above-normal seasons in 12 of the last 20 years -- has been in an era of high activity for hurricanes since 1995. However, this high-activity pattern is expected to be offset in 2014 by the impacts of El NiÃ±o, and by cooler Atlantic Ocean temperatures than we've seen in recent years.\"Atmospheric and oceanic conditions across the tropical Pacific are already taking on some El NiÃ±o characteristics. Also, we are currently seeing strong trade winds and wind shear over the tropical Atlantic, and NOAA's climate models predict these conditions will persist, in part because of El NiÃ±o,\" Bell said. \"The expectation of near-average Atlantic Ocean temperatures this season, rather than the above-average temperatures seen since 1995, also suggests fewer Atlantic hurricanes.\"NOAA is rolling out new tools at the National Hurricane Center this year. An experimental mapping tool will be used to show communities their storm surge flood threat. The map will be issued for coastal areas when a hurricane or tropical storm watch is first issued, or approximately 48 hours before the anticipated onset of tropical storm force winds. The map will show land areas where storm surge could occur and how high above ground the water could reach in those areas.Early testing on continued improvements to NOAA's Hurricane Weather Research and Forecasting model (HWRF) shows a 10 percent improvement in this year's model compared to last year. Hurricane forecasters use the HWRF along with other models to produce forecasts and issue warnings. The HWRF model is being adopted by a number of Western Pacific and Indian Ocean rim nations.NOAA's seasonal hurricane outlook is not a hurricane landfall forecast; it does not predict how many storms will hit land or where a storm will strike. Forecasts for individual storms and their impacts will be provided throughout the season by NOAA's National Hurricane Center."}

The Eastern Pacific hurricane season runs from May 15 through Nov. 30, with peak activity from July through September.\"The key climate factor behind the outlook is the likely development of El NiÃ±o this summer. El NiÃ±o decreases the vertical wind shear over the eastern tropical Pacific, favoring more and stronger tropical storms and hurricanes,\" said Gerry Bell, Ph.D., lead seasonal hurricane forecaster with NOAA's Climate Prediction Center, part of the U.S. National Weather Service. \"The eastern Pacific has been in an era of low activity for hurricanes since 1995, but this pattern will be offset in 2014 by the impacts of El NiÃ±o.\"Climate signals point to a potentially active hurricane season for the Eastern Pacific this year, making preparedness more important than ever. The public is encouraged to take time now to learn their personal risk, build an emergency kit and develop a contingency plan in to ensure their resiliency in the face of wind, rain, flooding and storm surge that a hurricane may bring.The outlook is a general guide to the overall seasonal hurricane activity. It does not predict whether, where, or when any of these storms may hit land. Eastern Pacific tropical storms and hurricanes most often track westward over open waters, sometimes reaching Hawaii. However, some occasionally head toward the northeast and may bring rainfall to the arid southwestern United States during the summer or fall. Also, on average, two to three storms per season affect western Mexico or Central America.NOAA's hurricane outlook for the Central Pacific basin calls for a near-normal or above-normal season while the Atlantic basin is expected to be near-normal or below-normal."}

We expect 4 to 7 tropical cyclones to affect the central Pacific this season. An average season has 4-5 tropical cyclones, which include tropical depressions, tropical storms and hurricanes.This outlook is based upon the expectation of El NiÃ±o developing during the 2014 hurricane season. El NiÃ±o decreases the vertical wind shear over the tropical central Pacific, favoring the development of more and stronger tropical cyclones.

{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_275", "content": "The results of the study, published today in the journal \"The absolute value of the latitudes at which these storms reach their maximum intensity seems to be increasing over time, in most places,\" says Kerry Emanuel, an MIT professor and co-author of the new paper. \"The trend is statistically significant at a pretty high level.\"And while the scientists who conducted the study are still investigating the atmospheric mechanisms behind this change, the trend seems consistent with a warming climate.\"It may mean the thermodynamically favorable conditions for these storms are migrating poleward,\" adds Emanuel, the Cecil and Ida Green Professor of Earth and Planetary Sciences at MIT.The implications are serious, since the movement of peak intensity means regions further north and south of the equator, which have not previously had to face many landfalls by violent cyclones, may now have greater exposure to these extreme weather events. That, in turn, could lead to \"potentially profound consequences to life and property,\" the paper states. \"Any related changes to positions where storms make landfall will have obvious effects on coastal residents and infrastructure.\"The paper, \"The Poleward Migration of the Location of Tropical Cyclone Maximum Intensity,\" was co-written by Emanuel, James P. Kossin of the University of Wisconsin, and Gabriel A. Vecchi of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).To conduct the study, the scientists used international data from 1982 to 2012, collected by NOAA's National Climactic Data Center. They used the location of peak intensity of cyclones as a benchmark because it is a more consistent metric than statistics such as storm duration: The duration can be harder to estimate because of difficulties in establishing precisely when a storm should first be considered a tropical cyclone.While there are regional differences in the poleward movement of cyclones, the fact that every ocean basin other than the northern Indian Ocean has experienced this change leads the researchers to suggest, in the paper, that this \"migration away from the tropics is a global phenomenon.\"However, Emanuel notes, the global mechanisms underlying the trend are a matter for further research.\"We think, but have not yet been able to establish, that this is connected to independently observed poleward expansion of the Hadley circulation,\" Emanuel says, referring to a large-scale pattern of global winds, which in recent years has also moved further poleward. The paper notes the potential impact of vertical wind shear, which inhibits cyclone formation; data suggests a decrease in wind shear in the tropics and an increase at higher latitudes.Emanuel notes that researchers in the field are continuing to examine the links between storm migration and global warming. Over the past three decades, the incidence of cyclones in the tropics has actually diminished -- because while tropical cyclones may become more intense in a warmer climate, it is actually more difficult to generate them.Ocean temperatures between 82 and 86 degrees Fahrenheit seem to be \"ideal for the genesis of tropical cyclones,\" Emanuel says, \"and as that belt migrates poleward, which surely it must as the whole ocean warms, the tropical cyclone genesis regions might just move with it. But we have more work to do to nail it down.\""}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_276", "content": "And the true fetal death toll may even be higher, because of the displacement of people whose homes and way of life were destroyed, suggest the authors.Hurricane Katrina struck the state of Louisiana, USA, on August 29 2005, followed by Hurricane Rita a month later on September 24. Katrina was the costliest natural disaster in American history, while Rita was the fourth most intense hurricane ever recorded.Both hurricanes caused widespread damage to property and infrastructure and left a trail of injury, death, and trauma in their wake.The researchers used composite figures from several government agencies, showing that the hurricanes caused damage in 38 out of 64 areas (parishes) in the state, with almost 205, 000 housing units affected.In four parishes, more than half of the local housing stock was damaged; in three others, between 10% and 50% was damaged. Elsewhere, the level of damage to housing stock was categorised as 1%-10%, or less than 1%.The researchers then calculated the odds of a pregnancy resulting in a stillbirth in damaged and undamaged areas (less than 1% damage) in the 20 months before, and the 28 months after, Katrina struck.But they also looked at all birth data between 1999 and 2009 in Louisiana to gauge usual patterns: during this period, 5194 stillbirths were recorded.They then used space-time models to assess whether the extent of damage wrought by the hurricanes was linked to the risk of stillbirths in a given area.Their calculations indicated that the risk of a pregnancy ending in a stillbirth was 40% higher in parishes where 10-50% of housing stock had been damaged, and more than twice as high in areas where over 50% of the housing stock had taken a hit.After taking account of known risk factors, every 1% increase in the extent of damage to housing stock was associated with a corresponding 7% rise in the number of stillbirths.Based on these figures, the researchers calculated that of the 410 stillbirths officially recorded in extensively damaged parishes, up to half (117-205) may have been directly caused by the hurricanes and the subsequent devastation.Their estimates suggest that stillbirths made up around 17.5% to 30.5% of the total death toll in the wake of the hurricanes.But the risk of stillbirth may have been even higher, suggest the researchers. In the hardest hit areas, the number of live births was more than 40% lower in 2007 than it was in 2004. And in parishes with more half of the housing stock damaged, the live birth rate fell by 79% in the three months following Katrina.This \"precipitous decline\" is likely to reflect the well documented exodus of residents from the coastal parishes of Louisiana into other areas, they suggest.They point to previously published research, showing a link between maternal stress, depression, and trauma and birth complications, including stillbirths.And they warn that climate change scientists have predicted an increase in the frequency, intensity, and duration of North Atlantic tropical cyclones like Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.\"Insofar as our empirical findings meaningfully generalise in time, the health risks to the unborn and their perinatal development will likely increase with more frequent and intense hurricanes,\" they write."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_277", "content": "Weather systems that bring rainstorms to many drought-prone areas of northern Africa, carry Saharan dust across the ocean and seed Atlantic hurricanes could grow stronger as a result of human-caused climate change, a new analysis by Stanford scientists suggests.Known as African easterly waves, or AEWs, these weather systems form above northern Africa during the summer season and travel east to west, toward the Atlantic Ocean.\"Not only are AEWs important for rainfall in West Africa, they also play a role in climate across the Atlantic, including here in the United States,\" said Noah Diffenbaugh, an associate professor of environmental Earth system science and a senior fellow at the Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment.The climate of West Africa varies sharply from the wet tropical region along the equator to the very dry Sahara desert in the north. The strip of land that lies between these two extremes, called the Sahel, has experienced some of the most prolonged and severe droughts in the world over the past half century.AEWs travel from east to west across northern Africa along two tracks. One track lies along the southern Sahel and Guinea coast region. The other track follows the border between the northern Sahel and southern Sahara Desert. Along the northern track, the strength of the AEWs is driven largely by the difference in the ground temperature of the Sahara and the relatively cooler surface temperatures over the Sahel and Guinea Coast farther south. The greater the temperature difference, the more potential energy there is for storm systems such as AEWs to draw from.Because AEWs have such a strong influence on the climate in Africa and the Atlantic basin, Diffenbaugh and a graduate student in his lab, Christopher Skinner, wanted to understand how a warming atmosphere might affect the strength and track of AEWs. Their research is detailed in the April 28 issue of the The pair began by analyzing simulations from 17 computer models of interactions between Earth's ocean and atmosphere. Each model was produced by a different research institute, and each one simulates physical processes in a slightly different way.\"For example, all models need a component that simulates rainfall. There are multiple ways to represent rainfall in a model, and each model does it slightly differently,\" Skinner said. \"By using multiple models we are able to get a better sense of what the possible range of climate responses will be for a given level of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.\"Diffenbaugh and Skinner focused on simulations of AEWs during the period from 1980 to 2005 and simulations of AEWs during a projected future period in which the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide is roughly twice what it is today. Although some of the models differed in their simulation of AEWs during the 20th century, nearly all agreed that the winds associated with AEWs would grow stronger by the late-21st century if increases in greenhouse gas emissions continue along their current trajectory.Additionally, all of the models predicted that as greenhouse gases rise, both the Sahara Desert and the Guinea coast region to the south will heat up, but the desert will warm more than the Guinea region.\"The temperature difference between the desert and the region farther south actually becomes larger than it is today,\" Skinner said. \"Because the strength of the African easterly waves is influenced by the temperature difference between these two regions, we would expect the energy of the AEWs to become larger, and that's what the simulations show.\"In particular, the models predict a strengthening in the AEWs that travel near the border of the Sahara and the Sahel. This strengthening could have important impacts on precipitation in the drought-prone Sahel region.\"This is a region that has experienced some of the most severe humanitarian disasters from droughts,\" Diffenbaugh said. \"But there has also been a lot of uncertainty about how global warming could impact rainfall in that region. To see such clear agreement in the response of AEWs to climate change opens the door for increasing our understanding of Sahel precipitation.\"A strengthening of waves in this region could also mean more uplift and transport of dust out of Africa and across the Atlantic. In the current climate, these dust plumes deliver life-sustaining nutrients to the ocean but also can affect rainfall and air quality as far away as the Caribbean.The authors also note that stronger AEWs could influence hurricanes that form in the Atlantic. The African easterly waves themselves don't become hurricanes, but a wave can create a protective environment in which significant rainfall and vertical wind motion can develop. \"This convection can serve as the seed for a hurricane,\" Skinner said.Not all Atlantic hurricanes are tied to AEWs, but studies have indicated that about 80 percent of the most intense hurricanes are associated with the African disturbances. A stronger AEW could conceivably influence the likelihood that the AEW generates a tropical cyclone, but the authors urge caution in jumping to conclusions.\"Hurricanes will be affected by global warming through changes in sea surface temperature, wind shear, and other environmental variables,\" Skinner said. \"This is just one piece of a very complicated puzzle, but it's an interesting piece that hasn't really been looked at before.\""}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_278", "content": "Professor and Associate Dean of the Faculty Michael R. Greenberg and five colleagues at Rutgers University in New Jersey undertook their study to gauge public support for policies such as prohibiting housing in high risk flood zones, requiring houses to be constructed to resist storms, and taking other steps to reduce the vulnerability of areas prone to hurricane and severe weather damage. They also were interested in identifying the factors most strongly associated with a willingness to politically and financially support these and other policies. The authors say that New Jersey is among the most beleaguered states along the East coast, having been inundated by Hurricane Floyd in 1999 and Hurricane Irene in 2011, both of which wreaked massive damage and cost billions of dollars. The other Rutgers University researchers who conducted the study include Marc D. Weiner, Robert Noland, Jeanne Herb, Marjorie Kaplan and Anthony J. Broccoli.For their study, Public Support for Policies to Reduce Risk after Hurricane Sandy, the researchers' survey results found that 53 to 63 percent of respondents favored government policies, such as allowing local government to require disaster-resistant home construction and having federal and state officials designate storm buffer areas as off limits to development. Furthermore, 49 percent favored government financial incentives to rebuild damaged areas in ways that would reduce future risk, and 42 percent supported prohibiting housing in certain areas. Overall, 49 percent of respondents \"strongly favored\" four or more of seven policy options, while the combined proportion of respondents who either \"strongly\" or \"somewhat favored\" one of the options ranged from 61 to 85 percent. The article was recently posted electronically in the journal Risk Analysis, a publication of the Society for Risk Analysis.The researchers found almost all respondents unwilling to pay out of their own pockets for mitigation and other programs. Regarding support for an income tax increase of 1 percent for 5 years, the study found that only 19 percent of respondents strongly supported the tax compared with 68.6 percent who strongly opposed it. Likewise, only 24.2 percent strongly supported a 1 percent increase in the state's sales tax for 5 years, compared with 64.4 percent who strongly opposed that policy option. Only 14.4 percent of respondents supported a 5-cents-per gallon tax on gasoline sales for 5 years, compared with 77.8 percent who strongly opposed the idea. Noting that 52.5 percent of respondents strongly supported a special 1 percent tax on hotels, motels, airports and recreation facilities for 5 years, the authors' comment that \"the consensus was to pass the cost to future generations or to visitors, many of whom will not be from the state.\"Interestingly, residents of the New Jersey Shore area were not more in favor of mitigation programs than other New Jersey residents. Between shore and non-shore respondents, only minimal differences were found in support for government mitigation and resilience actions.In trying to understand what attributes would make respondents most supportive of government policies in response to hurricanes and other such disasters, the researchers focused on issues relating to concerns about climate change and trust in scientists who study it. They also focused on views towards the federal government playing a major role in land use and building management programs.The survey found that 64 percent of respondents agreed that climate change is a risk to them and their family and friends. Perceptions and values concerning climate change proved to be the strongest factor predicting support for government mitigation and resilience policies. At the same time, according to the researchers, their findings do not mean that the policies described in their study and other similar studies will be supported or followed. The authors cite three obstacles that emerged from their research. First, half of the respondents felt that state and local government did not understand the implications of global climate change for their region, and two-thirds did not trust the local news media to inform them about events. Moreover, as in other states, many New Jersey residents expressed a generic distrust of the federal government. The most important long-term constraint is the unwillingness of people to support the establishment of a dedicated fund with their own funds. As time passes, without another major event, support for these policies will decrease."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_279", "content": "That simple fact shows not only the scale and power of a tropical cyclone, but the difficulty of modeling and forecasting its potential for coastal flooding on the fine scale needed to most effectively prepare a response.Now, a study led by Professor Harry Wang of William & Mary's Virginia Institute of Marine Science demonstrates the ability to predict a hurricane's storm tide at the level of individual neighborhoods and streets -- a much finer scale than current operational methods.The study, published in today's issue of the \"Storm-surge modeling is a tough problem,\" says Wang. \"People are interested in the possibility of flooding on a very fine scale, on the order of their house, office, or street.\" But for a forecast model to work, he says, \"We have to resolve the boundary conditions -- -- data on tides and winds -- very far away, out into the open ocean. And we have to have that information far enough beforehand to provide time for people and agencies to respond.\"Wang and his modeling team -- fellow VIMS researchers Derek Loftis, Zhuo Liu, David Forrest, and Joseph Zhang -- conducted their study by \"hindcasting\" Hurricane Sandy's landfall along the U.S. Atlantic coast. In this technique, scientists initiate a computer model with data collected before a past event, and then test the model's accuracy by comparing its output with observations recorded as the event unfolded.For their test case, Wang and colleagues first used a large-scale model called SELFE to hindcast Sandy-driven changes in water level along the entire East Coast, from Florida to Nova Scotia. They initialized SELFE by entering data on normal tidal conditions along the model's open-ocean boundary, which is drawn almost 1,500 miles offshore. They allowed the model to \"spin-up\" for 10 days ahead of Sandy's approach, then another 5 days forward in time once the storm had entered the model grid, adding data on wind speed, wind direction, and air pressure in 6-minute time steps. They derived these data from NOAA's large-scale NAM (North American Mesoscale) model and a separate fine-scale atmospheric model called RAMS. RAMS -- short for Regional Atmospheric Modeling System -- was developed by the Poquoson office of Weatherflow Inc., a private-sector provider of weather data.Wang stresses the importance of a good atmospheric model. \"You cannot accurately forecast storm surge without accurate wind forcing,\" he says. \"We are happy to be able to use RAMS, and it seems to be working quite well.\"Wang says the 6-minute time-step is also key to their model's success. Some storm-surge models resolve time in increments as short as 3 seconds, but doing so requires computing power that exceeds even that available in W&M's SciClone Computing Complex. \"A 6-minute time-step allows us to run a 5-day simulation in 40 minutes,\" says Wang. \"That's the kind of rapid run-time you need for forecasting.\"The second step for Wang's team was to use output from the \"large-domain\" SELFE model -- which they verified by comparing with actual readings from NOAA tide gauges between Long Island and Chesapeake Bay -- to drive a model of much higher resolution focused on New York City and its harbor. This \"sub-grid inundation model\" incorporates high-resolution elevation data collected with LIDAR, a mapping technique that uses airborne lasers to map the ground surface to within a few inches of its actual height.\"High-resolution hydrodynamic models are essential to account for the effects of local features,\" says Wang. \"When water floods into a city, it encounters everything from waterfront berms to streets, railroads, parks, highways, subway stations, bridges, and building of all different kinds.\" These structures and surfaces not only divert and channel the water, but provide different levels of friction that must be modeled as well.VIMS Dean & Director John Wells calls the results of the team's sub-grid inundation model a \"breakthrough\" in storm-tide forecasting -- with model output within 6 to 8 inches of the water levels recorded in New York City during Sandy by the U.S. Geological Survey. The USGS measured Sandy's flooding by deploying temporary tide gauges at selected sites during the storm, and by sending out teams of observers afterward to record mud and wrack lines on buildings, roadways, and other infrastructure.Says Wang, \"Our results compared very favorably with the USGS' Hurricane Sandy Mapper database in terms of timing, area of inundation, and depth of floodwaters. The maximum extent of horizontal inundation was within 30 meters [90 feet] of the USGS values.\"Animations created by Assistant Research Scientist David Forrest show the accuracy of the sub-grid inundation model in stunning detail. \"The animation clearly shows water going around buildings and rushing through the streets,\" says Wang.\"What we've achieved is an efficient platform that addresses both large-scale storm tide and high-resolution inundation problems simultaneously,\" he adds. \"Our future plans are to add the many other processes that are at play during a hurricane -- rainfall, filtration, storm-water drainage, and the effect of waves. That's the goal for our future development and further improvements.\""}

Green Institute of Physics and Planetary Physics (IGPP) at Scripps. \"Having dense, detailed information about the vertical moisture distribution close to the storms is an important advancement, so if you put this information into a weather model it will actually have an impact and improve the forecast.\"\"These are exciting results, especially given the complications involved in working from an airplane,\" says Eric DeWeaver, program director in the National Science Foundation's (NSF) Division of Atmospheric and Geospace Sciences, which funded the research. \"Satellite-based measurements are now regularly used for weather forecasting and have a big impact, but airplanes can go beyond satellites in making observations that are targeted right where you want them.\"The GRL paper details a 2010 flight campaign aboard NSF aircraft and subsequent data analysis that demonstrated for the first time that atmospheric information could be captured by an airborne GPS device. The instrumentation, which the scientists labeled \"GISMOS\" (GNSS [Global Navigation Satellite System] Instrument System for Multistatic and Occultation Sensing), increased the number of atmospheric profiles for studying the evolution of tropical storms by more than 50 percent.\"We're looking at how moisture evolves so when we see tropical waves moving across the Atlantic, we can learn more about which one is going to turn into a hurricane,\" said Haase. \"So being able to look at what happens in these events at the early stages will give us a lot longer lead time for hurricane warnings.\"\"This is another case where the effective use of GPS has the potential to improve the forecast and therefore save lives,\" said Richard Anthes, president emeritus of the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research, which currently runs the satellite based GPS measurements system called COSMIC (Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate).While the current GISMOS design occupies a refrigerator's worth of space, Haase and her colleagues are working to miniaturize the technology to shoe box size. From there, the system can more feasibly fit onto commercial aircraft, with hundreds of daily flights and a potential flood of new atmospheric data to greatly improve hurricane forecasting and weather models.The technology also could improve interpretation of long-term climate models by advancing scientists' understanding of factors such as the moisture conditions that are favorable for hurricane development.Paytsar Muradyan, who recently received a Ph.D. from Purdue University in atmospheric sciences, started working with Haase in 2007 as a graduate student during the formative stages of GISMOS's design and development. She eventually flew with the group in the 2010 campaign and took away a wealth of experience from the demands of the project.\"It was a lot of responsibility but certainly rewarding to work with a group of world-known scientists in an interdisciplinary project,\" said Muradyan."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_282", "content": "Hurricane Sandy, also known as Superstorm Sandy, was the deadliest and most destructive hurricane of the 2012 Atlantic hurricane season, according to government sources. Damage estimates exceed $65 billion and nearly 300 people perished along the path of the storm in seven countries.\"As the climate changes in the 21st century, there is a possibility that more hurricanes will stray farther north along the eastern seaboard, like Sandy did,\" says Stephen Good, a postdoctoral fellow in geology and geophysics at the University of Utah, and lead author on the study. \"It therefore becomes increasingly important to better understand the processes at work in these large storm systems.\"To that end, researchers at the U took to the Internet to invite volunteers to collect water samples as the storm passed.\"During Sandy, we used crowdsourcing to obtain an unprecedented collection of hurricane rain waters,\" says Gabriel Bowen, associate professor of geology and geophysics, who launched the sampling effort after realizing the storm was on track to impact a large part of the eastern United States. \"By taking advantage of data and samples gathered from residents on the ground, we were able to pinpoint where and when key features of the storm system developed and how they evolved, allowing us to develop a more complete picture of the storm.\"Tropical cyclones, also referred to as hurricanes when they occur over the North Atlantic Ocean, are rapidly rotating storm systems that cause strong winds and heavy rain. They form over large bodies of relatively warm water, deriving their energy from evaporation and eventual condensation of water from the ocean's surface.\"Sandy left a distinctive isotopic signature in rain collected from the mid-Atlantic up into in New England that shows how a dry cold front originating out of the Midwest joined with Sandy -- which developed from a tropical wave over warm water in the Caribbean -- and likely prolonged and expanded the storm,\" says Bowen.The sampling technique provides a new way of studying how these \"extra-tropical\" hurricanes interact with the weather systems of the northern latitudes, and thereby aids in hurricane forecasting and analysis.The team used a variety of electronic means -- including science community email lists, Twitter, Facebook, blogs and crowdsourcing sites -- to alert the public to the study and to solicit samples.For consistency, samples were collected on private property, from well-anchored containers in open, outdoor locations every 12 hours (8 a.m. and 8 p.m. Eastern time).A total of 685 samples were collected from more than 125 volunteers at sites from North Carolina to Indiana to New Brunswick, Canada. The majority of the samples were obtained in regions of the U.S. mid-Atlantic -- where the storm's impact was greatest -- but having samples from the further reaches of the storm was key in allowing the researchers to investigate processes occurring at Sandy's margins.The samples were shipped to the Utah lab in November 2012 and analyzed for their composition of hydrogen and oxygen isotopes, which provide a fingerprint of water sources, transport and rainout in the storm.Isotopes are subtly different forms of chemical elements that vary in their weight and, as a result, their physical behavior. For example, heavier isotopes evaporate from liquids less readily and condense out of vapor more readily. As water changes state from liquid to vapor and vice versa, the variations in oxygen and hydrogen isotope ratios give researchers a sensitive tool to calculate the hydrologic budget -- that is, the inflow, outflow and storage of water -- of large cyclones.For the analysis of the rain isotope data Bowen and Good teamed up with graduate student Derek Mallia and associate professor John Lin in the U's department of atmospheric sciences. Mallia and Lin made use of a computer model of the atmosphere which was able to \"run the tape backwards\" and track the source of the rainwater backwards to the locations that contributed moisture to the storm.In this study, exceptionally low levels of the heavy isotope oxygen-18 were found in samples from the southwest area of the storm, tracking extreme losses of water as precipitation neared the storm's center. Using their dense network of samples, the researchers were able to show this signature, which has also been used to reconstruct the occurrence of prehistoric hurricanes, was limited to a narrow region of the storm where the most intense precipitation was found.As Sandy traveled north and its intensity decreased, the oxygen-18 levels moderated. However, levels of another isotope -- deuterium -- increased in parts of the storm when Sandy collided with the dry air from a continental cold front. The researchers argue that this signal shows that the storm picked up more moisture, and energy, from the frontal system and from evaporation off of the Atlantic, which led to intense rainfall over New England.\"The isotope data give fundamentally different information than can be obtained from satellite imagery or other conventional means of tracking storms,\" says Good. \"Satellite imagery gives you information about the location of clouds and rain, but it cannot tell you where this water, and the energy that it contributes to the storm, came from.\"Researchers anticipate that as these types of interactions are better documented and further studied, they may lead to advances in weather models that will ultimately improve storm prediction."}

The team used a complex computer model and data obtained from Hurricane Katrina, which struck the Gulf Coast in 2005 and produced catastrophic damage.The researchers found that aerosols tend to weaken the development of hurricanes (tropical storms that form in the Atlantic Ocean) or typhoons (those formed in the Pacific). They also found that aerosols tend to cause a hurricane to fall apart earlier and wind speeds are lower than storms where anthropogenic aerosols are not present.On average, there are about 90 hurricanes or cyclones that form each year around the world, meaning their findings could be crucial in how we evaluate and prepare for destructive tropical storms.\"The results are surprising,\" Zhang says, \"because other studies have leaned global warming by greenhouse gases makes hurricanes more intense and frequent. We found that aerosols may operate oppositely than greenhouse gases in terms of influencing hurricanes.\"Another thing we find, however, is that aerosols appear to increase the amount of precipitation in a hurricane or typhoon. The rainbands associated with such tropical storms seem to be larger and stronger.\"Zhang says the results could prove beneficial in how future hurricanes are studied -- and how important the presence or absence of aerosols impact the development of such storms.Katrina, for example, was the most destructive storm in U.S. history, with damages totaling more than $100 billion and the storm killed more than 1,800 people. Winds topped 175 miles per hour and the storm flooded 80 percent of the New Orleans area.\"The information produced from this study could be very helpful in the way we forecast hurricanes,\" Zhang explains.\"Future studies may need to factor in the aerosol effect. If a hurricane or typhoon is formed in a part of the world where we know that anthropogenic aerosols are almost certainly present, that data needs to be considered in the storm formation and development and eventual storm preparation.\"Yuan Wang, who conducted the research with Zhang while at Texas A&M, currently works at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory as a Caltech Postdoctoral Scholar.The study was funded by grants from NASA, Texas A&M's Supercomputing facilities and the Ministry of Science and Technology of China."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_284", "content": "For the past 24 years, Mark Z. Jacobson, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Stanford, has been developing a complex computer model to study air pollution, energy, weather and climate. A recent application of the model has been to simulate the development of hurricanes. Another has been to determine how much energy wind turbines can extract from global wind currents.In light of these recent model studies and in the aftermath of hurricanes Sandy and Katrina, he said, it was natural to wonder: What would happen if a hurricane encountered a large array of offshore wind turbines? Would the energy extraction due to the storm spinning the turbines' blades slow the winds and diminish the hurricane, or would the hurricane destroy the turbines?So he went about developing the model further and simulating what might happen if a hurricane encountered an enormous wind farm stretching many miles offshore and along the coast. Amazingly, he found that the wind turbines could disrupt a hurricane enough to reduce peak wind speeds by up to 92 mph and decrease storm surge by up to 79 percent.The study, conducted by Jacobson, and Cristina Archer and Willett Kempton of the University of Delaware, was published online in The researchers simulated three hurricanes: Sandy and Isaac, which struck New York and New Orleans, respectively, in 2012; and Katrina, which devastated New Orleans in 2005.\"We found that when wind turbines are present, they slow down the outer rotation winds of a hurricane,\" Jacobson said. \"This feeds back to decrease wave height, which reduces movement of air toward the center of the hurricane, increasing the central pressure, which in turn slows the winds of the entire hurricane and dissipates it faster.\"In the case of Katrina, Jacobson's model revealed that an array of 78,000 wind turbines off the coast of New Orleans would have significantly weakened the hurricane well before it made landfall.In the computer model, by the time Hurricane Katrina reached land, its simulated wind speeds had decreased by 36-44 meters per second (between 80 and 98 mph) and the storm surge had decreased by up to 79 percent.For Hurricane Sandy, the model projected a wind speed reduction by 35-39 meters per second (between 78 and 87 mph) and as much as 34 percent decrease in storm surge.Jacobson acknowledges that, in the United States, there has been political resistance to installing a few hundred offshore wind turbines, let alone tens of thousands. But he thinks there are two financial incentives that could motivate such a change.One is the reduction of hurricane damage cost. Damage from severe hurricanes, caused by high winds and storm surge-related flooding, can run into the billions of dollars. Hurricane Sandy, for instance, caused roughly $82 billion in damage across three states.Second, Jacobson said, the wind turbines would pay for themselves in the long term by generating normal electricity while at the same time reducing air pollution and global warming, and providing energy stability.\"The turbines will also reduce damage if a hurricane comes through,\" Jacobson said. \"These factors, each on their own, reduce the cost to society of offshore turbines and should be sufficient to motivate their development.\"An alternative plan for protecting coastal cities involves building massive seawalls. Jacobson said that while these might stop a storm surge, they wouldn't impact wind speed substantially. The cost for these, too, is significant, with estimates running between $10 billion and $40 billion per installation.Current turbines can withstand wind speeds of up to 112 mph, which is in the range of a category 2 to 3 hurricane, Jacobson said. His study suggests that the presence of massive turbine arrays will likely prevent hurricane winds from reaching those speeds."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_285", "content": "\"For this particular study aircraft-based Doppler radar information was ingested into the system,\" said Fuqing Zhang, professor of meteorology, Penn State. \"Our predictions were comparable to or better than those made by operational global models.\"Zhang and Erin B. Munsell, graduate student in meteorology, used The Pennsylvania State University real-time convection-permitting hurricane analysis and forecasting system (WRF-EnKF) to analyze Hurricane Sandy. While Sandy made landfall on the New Jersey coast on the evening of Oct. 29, 2012, the analysis and forecast system began tracking on Oct. 21 and the Doppler radar data analyzed covers Oct. 26 through 28.The researchers compared The WRF-EnKF predictions to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Global Forecast System (GFS) and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). Besides the ability to effectively assimilate real-time Doppler radar information, the WRF-EnKF model also includes high-resolution cloud-permitting grids, which allow for the existence of individual clouds in the model.\"Our model predicted storm paths with 100 km -- 50 mile -- accuracy four to five days ahead of landfall for Hurricane Sandy,\" said Zhang. \"We also had accurate predictions of Sandy's intensity.\"The WRF-EnKF model also runs 60 storm predictions simultaneously as an ensemble, each with slightly differing initial conditions. The program runs on NOAA's dedicated computer, and the analysis was done on the Texas Advanced Computing Center computer because of the enormity of data collected.To analyze the Hurricane Sandy forecast data, the researchers divided the 60 runs into groups -- good, fair and poor. This approach was able to isolate uncertainties in the model initial conditions, which are most prevalent on Oct. 26, when 10 of the predictions suggested that Sandy would not make landfall at all. By looking at this portion of the model, Zhang suggests that the errors occur because of differences in the initial steering level winds in the tropics that Sandy was embedded in, instead of a mid-latitude trough -- an area of relatively low atmospheric pressure -- ahead of Sandy's path.\"Though the mid-latitude system does not strongly influence the final position of Sandy, differences in the timing and location of its interactions with Sandy lead to considerable differences in rainfall forecasts, especially with respect to heavy precipitation over land,\" the researchers report in a recent issue of the Journal of Advances in Modeling Earth Systems.By two days before landfall, the WRF-EnKF model was accurately predicting the hurricane's path with landfall in southern New Jersey, while the GFS model predicted a more northern landfall in New York and Connecticut, and the ECMWF model forecast landfall in northern New Jersey.Hurricane Sandy is a good storm to analyze because its path was unusual among Atlantic tropical storms, which do not usually turn northwest into the mid-Atlantic or New England. While all three models did a fairly good job at predicting aspects of this hurricane, the WRF-EnKF model was very promising in predicting path, intensity and rainfall.NOAA is currently evaluating the use of the WRF-EnKF system in storm prediction, and other researchers are using it to predict storm surge and risk analysis."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_286", "content": "Researchers used erosion data following tropical storms and hurricanes that hit Santa Rosa Island, off Floridaâs Panhandle, and sea-level rise projections to predict beach habitat changes over the next 90 years. But they say their model can be used to inform nourishment decisions at any beach.Since the first project of its kind in the U.S. at Coney Island, N.Y., in 1922, coastal managers have used beach nourishment â essentially importing sand to replace sediment lost through storms or erosion â to restore damaged beaches, but it is laborious and expensive. Adding to coastal managersâ headaches, the offshore sand used for such ventures is running short.Florida has allotted $37 million in state money for beach nourishment projects this fiscal year, which ends June 30, and has appropriated almost $105 million over the past five years, according to the state Department of Environmental Protection.âMoving large amounts of sand onto the beach is costly,â said Rafael MuÃ±oz-Carpena, a UF professor of agricultural and biological engineering and study co-author. âCertainly preserving the beach has important benefits for humans and ecology, but as with any management decision, benefits need to be balanced by cost, especially when sooner or later the beach might be lost to sea-level rise or a major storm. How much is it worth for society to keep the beach longer in a given spot?âDecision-makers must answer those questions, and the answers wonât be cheap, MuÃ±oz-Carpena said.UF researchers used their model to find out how long a beach would last under varying conditions, said Greg Kiker, an associate professor in agricultural and biological engineering and a study co-author.âEveryone knows that when you nourish a beach, it doesnât last forever. It gets washed away,â  Kiker said. With mean sea level rising, a storm that may not have done as much damage 20 to 40 years ago can do more damage today, he said. âAs engineers, we said, âOK, what can we do about it?ââUsing the model, coastal managers can assess tradeoffs â spending vs. benefits â of beach nourishment that will provide the most benefit for vulnerable species, adjacent residential areas and military installations, MuÃ±oz-Carpena said.The study by members of UFâs Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences came after the U.S. Department of Defense asked for research to assess the future vulnerability of endangered and protected shorebirds on Panhandle military installations to rising sea levels and major storm surges.UF researchers used erosion data and post-storm nourishment strategies after hurricanes Ivan and Dennis and Tropical Storm Katrina struck the island, which is part of Eglin Air Force Base in Fort Walton Beach. The beach suffered severe erosion after each storm.They also used National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration data from 69 major storms over the past 154 years, within about 65 miles of Santa Rosa Island, to construct storm-striking scenarios.MuÃ±oz-Carpena and his colleagues said theyâre not urging coastal managers to pump sand, which generally comes from offshore, onto beaches at any particular frequency. He cautions that the data may be limited by the uncertainty of future tropical storms and sea level projections.The paper is in this monthâs issue of the journal"}

Dr. Vavrus suggests that, as of yet, the effect of climate change on Arctic cyclone activity has been minimal, but that future changes in polar climate will drive stronger shifts.\"One societally relevant implication is that more storminess probably means more erosion of Arctic coastlines, especially in tandem with declines in buffering sea ice cover and increases in thawing coastal permafrost,\" concluded Dr. Vavrus. \"Erosion of Arctic coastlines has already been growing more severe during recent decades, and this study points to a contributing factor that will likely become an even more recognizable culprit in the future.\""}

Sometimes we overprepare, and sometimes we underprepare.\"Stein will discuss his research in a presentation titled \"How Much Natural Hazard Mitigation is Enough?\" at the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) annual meeting in Chicago. His presentation is part of the symposium \"Hazards: What Do We Build For?\" to be held Feb. 17.Stein is the William Deering Professor of Geological Sciences in Northwestern's Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences.

In other cases, nature outsmarts us, doing great damage despite expensive mitigation measures or causing us to divert limited resources to mitigate hazards that are overestimated.\"To do better we need to get smarter,\" Stein said. \"This means thoughtfully tackling the tough questions about how much natural hazard mitigation is enough. Choices have to be made in a very uncertain world.\"Stein's talk will use general principles and case studies to explore how communities can do better by taking an integrated view of natural hazards issues, rather than treating the relevant geoscience, engineering, economics and policy formulation separately.Some of the tough questions include:The choice is difficult because although science has learned a lot about natural hazards, Stein says, our ability to predict the future is much more limited than often assumed. Much of the problem comes from the fact that formulating effective natural hazard policy involves combining science, economics and risk analysis to analyze a problem and explore costs and benefits of different options in situations where the future is very uncertain.Because mitigation policies are typically chosen without such analysis -- often by a government mandate that does not consider the costs to the affected communities -- the results are often disappointing."}

{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_290", "content": "The threatened shorebird, which migrates in spring to nest on sandy beaches along the Atlantic coast, is expected to capitalize on new habitat created by the storm on hard-hit Long Island, N.Y.\"Hurricane Sandy pushed sand over the vegetation of the barrier islands, leaving behind wider sandy beaches, which is the plover's preferred habitat,\" said Jim Fraser, a professor of wildlife conservation in the College of Natural Resources and Environment at Virginia Tech, who has studied piping plovers and other shorebirds for almost three decades.The bird was federally listed as threatened and endangered in 1986.Hurricane Sandy in 2012 created three inlets on Long Island's south shore, two of which the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers quickly filled. Fraser says he hopes the third inlet, in a designated wilderness area of Fire Island National Seashore, will remain open, as it is New York's only natural inlet.Long since the storm has passed, the inlet continues to shape the barrier islands, further improving plover habitat. The birds like to feed on insects and invertebrates that reside in intertidal flats -- shallow, watery areas on the bay side of barrier islands.Leaving the inlet open would not only be good for the piping plover, it would also be a smart move for taxpayers, according to Fraser. \"Post-storm public works projects are incredibly expensive. Ultimately, the taxpayer ends up footing the bill.\"On precarious barrier islands, houses and other buildings are vulnerable to destruction. The sands shift constantly under normal conditions; superstorms like Sandy rearrange them dramatically.\"We live too close to the sea,\" Fraser continued. \"The human, structural, and environmental costs are very high, and they are increasing with each storm as coastal development shows no signs of abating.\"While storm damage affects humans negatively, it can have the opposite effect on wildlife. \"Storm-created habitat is good for piping plovers and other birds,\" explained Fraser. Other positive environment impacts have also been observed. \"Local people say the fishing is better, clams are growing faster, and the water is cleaner.\"Fraser's work studying piping plovers in other environments, including a 12-year observation in nearby West Hampton Dunes, N.Y., confirms that plover populations increase when new habitat is created on barrier islands after massive storms.He expects to see plover populations on Long Island surge when the birds return this spring. His ongoing research is monitoring the outcome."}

Awards are conferred annually in five categories: Academic, Small Business, Greener Synthetic Pathways, Greener Reaction Conditions and Designing Greener Chemicals.Wool, UD professor of chemical and biomolecular engineering and director of the Affordable Composites from Renewable Resources (ACRES) program, is a world leader in developing safer chemical substances from renewable resources through processes that require less water and energy, and produce less hazardous waste compared to petroleum-based processes.The products can be used as adhesives, composites and foams -- even circuit boards, hurricane resistant energy efficient roofs and leather substitutes.\"Finding low toxicity replacements for commodity plastics such as polystyrene and PVC, adhesives, foams and composite resins, in addition to leather-like materials, must be a priority if we are to benefit the environment and human health,\" said Wool.Wool became passionate about sustainability in the early 1990s when he served as chairman of the American Society for Testing and Materials committee for biodegradable plastics. The committee included representatives from the farming community, state governments and major corporations, as well as environmentalists and members of the academic community.\"I became critically aware of the issues surrounding waste management, recycling, climate change and the protection of our natural resources,\" he said. \"I began to wonder if there was a better way.\"This motivated Wool to incorporate green chemistry and green engineering solutions into his research. He created several high-performance materials using biobased feedstocks, including vegetable oils, lignin, chicken feathers and flax. He developed hurricane resistant roofing with colleagues in UD's civil and environmental engineering department in response to issues in global warming. He has also signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the South African government to further its development of biobased township housing using ACRES inventions.In 2012, Dixie Chemical began producing Wool's bio-based composite resins for a worldwide market. His discoveries have led to the development of soy-based composites used in boats, tractor panels and wind turbine parts.One of Wool's more recent inventions is a breathable, bio-based eco-leather that avoids the traditional leather tanning process. This environmentally-friendly product, developed as a collaboration between researchers in Wool's ACRES group and colleagues in UD's fashion and apparel studies department, has resulted in collaborations with well-known companies such as Nike, Puma and others to use the leather substitute in their products. He shares a patent with Nike on the development of its new environmentally friendly air bubbles for athletic shoe wear.\"Ten years ago, green chemistry and engineering was a novel concept, but today, we are reaching a critical mass of individuals focused on sustainability and the environment,\" said Wool. \"This award lends credibility to what we are doing, and my hope is that it will cause some to give us a second look.\"Current and former students and colleagues in the ACRES group who contributed to Wool's green research will also be recognized during the ceremony."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_292", "content": "That's about 40 percent more than previously thought, according to a new analysis of these Arctic storms.A 40 percent difference in the number of cyclones could be important to anyone who lives north of 55 degrees latitude -- the area of the study, which includes the northern reaches of Canada, Scandinavia and Russia, along with the state of Alaska.The finding is also important to researchers who want to get a clear picture of current weather patterns, and a better understanding of potential climate change in the future, explained David Bromwich, professor of geography at The Ohio State University and senior research scientist at the Byrd Polar Research Center.The study was presented on Dec. 12 at the American Geophysical Union meeting, in a poster co-authored by his colleagues Natalia Tilinina and Sergey Gulev of the Russian Academy of Sciences and Moscow State University.\"We now know there were more cyclones than previously thought, simply because we've gotten better at detecting them,\" Bromwich said.Cyclones are zones of low atmospheric pressure that have wind circulating around them. They can form over land or water, and go by different names depending on their size and where they are located. In Columbus, Ohio, for instance, a low-pressure system in December would simply be called a winter storm. Extreme low-pressure systems formed in the tropical waters can be called hurricanes or typhoons.How could anyone miss a storm as big as a cyclone? You might think they are easy to detect, but as it turns out, many of the cyclones that were missed were small in size and short in duration, or occurred in unpopulated areas. Yet researchers need to know about all the storms that have occurred if they are to get a complete picture of storm trends in the region.\"We can't yet tell if the number of cyclones is increasing or decreasing, because that would take a multidecade view. We do know that, since 2000, there have been a lot of rapid changes in the Arctic -- Greenland ice melting, tundra thawing -- so we can say that we're capturing a good view of what's happening in the Arctic during the current time of rapid changes,\" Bromwich said.Bromwich leads the Arctic System Reanalysis (ASR) collaboration, which uses statistics and computer algorithms to combine and re-examine diverse sources of historical weather information, such as satellite imagery, weather balloons, buoys and weather stations on the ground.\"There is actually so much information, it's hard to know what to do with it all. Each piece of data tells a different part of the story -- temperature, air pressure, wind, precipitation -- and we try to take all of these data and blend them together in a coherent way,\" Bromwich said.The actual computations happen at the Ohio Supercomputer Center, and the combined ASR data are made publicly available to scientists.Two such scientists are cyclone experts Tilinina and Gulev, who worked with Bromwich to look for evidence of telltale changes in wind direction and air pressure in the ASR data. They compared the results to three other data re-analysis groups, all of which combine global weather data.\"We found that ASR provides new vision of the cyclone activity in high latitudes, showing that the Arctic is much more densely populated with cyclones than was suggested by the global re-analyses,\" Tilinina said.One global data set used for comparison was ERA-Interim, which is generated by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. Focusing on ERA-Interim data for latitudes north of 55 degrees, Tilinina and Gulev identified more than 1,200 cyclones per year between 2000 and 2010. For the same time period, ASR data yielded more than 1,900 cyclones per year.When they narrowed their search to cyclones that occurred directly over the Arctic Ocean, they found more than 200 per year in ERA-Interim, and a little over 300 per year in ASR.There was good agreement between all the data sets when it came to big cyclones, the researchers found, but the Arctic-centered ASR appeared to catch smaller, shorter-lived cyclones that escaped detection in the larger, global data sets. The ASR data also provided more detail on the biggest cyclones, capturing the very beginning of the storms earlier and tracking their decay longer.Extreme Arctic cyclones are of special concern to climate scientists because they melt sea ice, Bromwich said.\"When a cyclone goes over water, it mixes the water up. In the tropical latitudes, surface water is warm, and hurricanes churn cold water from the deep up to the surface. In the Arctic, it's the exact opposite: there's warmer water below, and the cyclone churns that warm water up to the surface, so the ice melts.\"As an example, he cited the especially large cyclone that hit the Arctic in August 2012, which scientists believe played a significant role in the record retreat of sea ice that year."}

The purpose of the mission, conducted last January, was to assess the post-Sandy health of the offshore barrier system that protects the New York Harbor and southwestern Long Island region against damage from future storms.The team conducted marine geophysical surveys of the seafloor and shallow subsurface to map the sedimentary impact of the hurricane on the beach/barrier systems of selected bay, inlet and nearshore areas of portions of the south shore of Long Island.Using a CHIRP (compressed high-intensity radar pulse) sonar system and an even higher frequency seafloor mapping system supplied by Stony Brook University, the scientists used two research vessels to profile the seafloor and upper sediment layers of the ocean bottom. They surveyed three representative segments of the shoreface that protects Long Island, each segment about 15 meters deep, one mile offshore and roughly six square miles in size.The storm, they found, did not significantly erode these sampled segments of shoreface.\"The shape of the bedforms that make up the barrier system did not change a whole lot,\" said co-Principal Investigator (PI) John Goff of the Institute for Geophysics. \"Where we might have expected to see significant erosion based on long-term history, not a lot happened -- nothing that ate into the shoreface.\"\"The sand largely took the blow,\" added co-PI Jamie Austin of the Institute for Geophysics. \"Like a good barricade, the barrier system absorbed the significant blow, but held.\"This was not the case in other storm-ravaged zones the Texas team has surveyed. When Hurricane Ike hit Galveston in 2008, the storm significantly disrupted the thin finer-grained sediment layer offshore, removing material underneath the shoreline in a way that exacerbated long-term problems of erosion.Compared to Galveston, Long Island has a greater abundance of sand in its overall system. The storm churned up much of this sand and moved bedforms, but the scientists speculate that the greater abundance of sand helped the offshore barriers maintain their overall shape and integrity as erosional barriers.Tempering this good news, the survey team also found evidence the storm brought new pollutants into the waters off Long Island. Heavy metals were detected in a layer of mud that the storm deposited offshore. Beth Christensen of Adelphi University traced the metals back to muds from the South Shore Estuary Reserve, which has a long history of pollution from industry and human habitation.By this summer, natural forces had dispersed the layer of mud offshore, and the concentrations of toxins were not high enough to be an immediate concern, said Christensen.\"But if we continue to see more events like Sandy, we'll see the introduction of more and more muds from the estuary,\" said Christensen, \"adding additional toxins to an already stressed system.\"Continued sea-level rise will also create more pressure on the barrier system, heightening problems onshore. With higher sea level, all of the onshore impacts of a storm like Sandy will go up, notes Goff.\"In the long-term, if sea level gets high enough, the barrier system has no choice but to retreat and move landwards,\" said Goff, exposing the shoreline to increased erosion. \"But at least for the present, there's no evidence of that being imminent.\"The mission was the sixth rapid response science mission funded by the Jackson School of Geosciences at The University of Texas at Austin. (The Institute for Geophysics is a research unit within the Jackson School.) The missions place geoscientists on the scenes of natural disasters as quickly as possible to measure the often vanishing traces of hurricanes, earthquakes, tsunamis and other disasters.\"The faster we get out into the field to measure Earth's response to naturally destructive events, the better we can relate data to the disasters,\" said Austin.Video:"}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_294", "content": "Writing in the current special issue of Sea level rise and its potential to dramatically change the coastal landscape through shoreline erosion and barrier island degradation, for example, is an under-appreciated and understudied factor that could lead to catastrophic changes in flood risk associated with tropical cyclones, known as hurricanes in the North Atlantic, they say.Woodruff adds, \"There is general agreement that while globally, tropical cyclones will decline in frequency, their strength will be more intense. However, there is less consensus on the magnitude of these changes, and it remains unclear how closely individual regions of tropical cyclone activity will follow global trends.\"Despite these uncertainties, the UMass Amherst geoscientist notes, the intensity and frequency of flooding by tropical cyclones will increase significantly due to accelerated sea level rise. Further, the geologic record provides clear examples for the importance of accelerated sea level rise in initiating significant changes in shoreline behavior.\"The era of relatively moderate sea level rise that most coastlines have experienced during the past few millennia is over, and shorelines are now beginning to adjust to a new boundary condition that in most cases serves to accelerate rates of shoreline retreat,\" he says.The authors focus on three physical factors they say should be considered together to understand future coastal flooding from hurricanes: Tropical cyclone climatology, relative sea level rise and shoreline change. \"Modes of climate variability explain 30 to 45 percent of the variance of tropical cyclone activity within the instrumental historical record. This percentage is far less, however, when considering only storms that make landfall,\" they point out.By contrast, \"a future rise in sea level is far more certain, particularly along the coastlines most prone to tropical cyclone disruption. For example, a rise in sea level of 1 meter for the New York City region would result in the present-day 100-year flood events occurring every 3 to 20 years. Most engineered coastlines are not designed for this increase in extreme flood frequency, and the dominance of sea-level rise and landscape dynamics on impacts by landfalling tropical cyclones must be acknowledged for effective planning and management of our future coastlines,\" Woodruff and colleagues write.They add that \"population centers most at risk of tropical cyclone impacts are mainly located along dynamic and subsiding sedimentary coasts that will serve to further enhance the impact of future tropical cyclone floods.\" People can soften such impacts \"partly with adaptive strategies, which include careful stewardship of sediments,\" and by reducing human-caused land subsidence along many of the world's most populated coastlines due to the extraction of groundwater, oil and gas.Woodruff and colleagues present prehistoric, instrumental and modeling evidence supporting the dominance of sea level rise on extreme flooding associated with tropical cyclones and the compounding influences of resulting shoreline change on the flood intensity by these events. They say that paleoreconstructions from barrier beach systems and accompanying marshes indicate that \"many if these coastal environments have remained remarkably stable over the last few millennia, despite episodic and extreme disruption by tropical cyclones.\"In stark contrast, these landforms were either non-existent or quickly washed over by storms, during pre-historic times of rapid sea level rise similar to those projected for the end of this century, in 2100. The authors point out, \"It is therefore prudent to expect a decrease in the resilience of these low-lying coastlines from tropical cyclone impacts when enhanced by elevated rates of sea level rise.\"Finally, they discuss management strategies in the context of \"an almost certain increase in tropical cyclone flood frequency,\" as well as the need for accurate assessments of the disturbance and resilience of coastal systems to episodic flooding by tropical cyclones under increased rates of sea level rise."}

Hippensteel and colleagues apply evidence of what they call the \"lack of a definitive signature\" from Hurricane Irene to a 1500-year paleostorm record at Onslow Bay. They write that fewer hurricanes could be found in the fossil and sedimentary records (through bioturbation or foraminiferal dissolution) than had actually made landfall there.The authors infer that the lack of storm records in the marsh sediments from Onslow Bay means that only hurricane strikes of higher magnitude can provide proxies for understanding the paleostorm record, because only the most robust storm deposits are archived. The lack of definitive signs of Hurricane Irene in the area raises their concerns about the current understanding of hurricane deposition and preservation."}

Bennett was working at Tulane University in New Orleans when Hurricane Katrina struck the Gulf Coast in 2005. Her flooded house became infested with molds, which she collected in samples, wearing a mask, gloves and protective gear.\"I felt horrible -- headaches, dizziness, nausea,\" said Bennett, now a professor of plant pathology and biology at Rutgers. \"I knew something about 'sick building syndrome' but until then I didn't believe in it. I didn't think it would be possible to breathe in enough mold spores to get sick.\" That is when she formed her hypothesis that volatiles might be involved.Inamdar, who uses fruit flies in her research, and Bennett began their study shortly after Bennett arrived at Rutgers. Bennett wanted to understand the connection between molds and symptoms like those she had experienced following Katrina.The scientists discovered that the volatile organic compound 1-octen-3-ol, otherwise known as mushroom alcohol, can cause movement disorders in flies, similar to those observed in the presence of pesticides, such as paraquat and rotenone. Further, they discovered that it attacked two genes that deal with dopamine, degenerating the neurons and causing the Parkinson's-like symptoms.Studies indicate that Parkinson's disease -- a progressive disease of the nervous system marked by tremor, muscular rigidity and slow, imprecise movement -- is increasing in rural areas, where it's usually attributed to pesticide exposure. But rural environments also have a lot of mold and mushroom exposure.\"Our work suggests that 1-octen-3-ol might also be connected to the disease, particularly for people with a genetic susceptibility to it,\" Inamdar said. \"We've given the epidemiologists some new avenues to explore.\""}

The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer or MODIS instrument aboard captured a visible image on Nov. 7, 2013 at 04:25 UTC/Nov. 6 at 11:25 p.m. EDT that showed the thick bands of powerful thunderstorms that surrounded the eye. The MODIS image also revealed a powerful, wide band of thunderstorms in the western quadrant that was affecting the Philippines in the early morning hours (Eastern Daylight Time/U.S.) on Nov. 7.At the same time, another instrument aboard Aqua captured infrared data on the storm using the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder or AIRS instrument, providing cloud top temperatures and sea surface temperatures. The infrared data revealed a sharply defined eye with multiple concentric rings of thunderstorms and a deep convective eyewall. The infrared data showed cloud top temperatures as cold as 210 degrees kelvin/-81.67F/-63.15C/ in the thick band of thunderstorms around the center. Those cold temperatures indicate very high, powerful thunderstorms with very heavy rain potential.On Nov. 7 at 1500 UTC/10 a.m. EDT, Super-Typhoon Haiyan's maximum sustained winds were near 165 knots/189.9 mph/305.6 kph.

The Joint Typhoon Warning Center estimated that gusts are as strong as 200 knots/ 230.2 mph/370.4 kph.The U.S. National Hurricane Center website indicates that a Category 5 hurricane/typhoon would cause catastrophic damage: A high percentage of framed homes will be destroyed, with total roof failure and wall collapse. Fallen trees and power poles will isolate residential areas. Power outages will last for weeks to possibly months. Most of the area will be uninhabitable for weeks or months.Haiyan was located near 10.4 north latitude and 128.1 east longitude, about 543 nautical miles east-southeast of Manila, Philippines. It is moving west-northwest at 22 knots/25.3 mph/40.7 kph and generating extremely rough seas with wave heights to 50 feet/15.2 meters.The Joint Typhoon Warning Center noted that extremely favorable environmental conditions such as the warm waters ahead of the system will help to maintain its strength at super typhoon intensity through landfall in the central Philippines and up to 1500 UTC/10 a.m. EDT on Nov. 8.

{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_298", "content": "Hurricane Sandy was the second-costliest hurricane to hit the US, hitting 24 states in late October last year, with New Jersey one of the worst affected.In 2012 32 million photos were posted on image hosting website Flickr and by counting the number of pictures tagged either 'Hurricane Sandy', 'hurricane' or 'sandy' between October 20 and November 20 2012, a team of researchers led by two Warwick Business School academics, Tobias Preis, Associate Professor of Behavioural Science and Finance, and Suzy Moat, Assistant Professor of Behavioural Science, found a strong link to atmospheric pressure dropping in New Jersey.In fact, the highest number of pictures posted were taken in the same hour in which Hurricane Sandy made landfall in New Jersey.In Preis and Moat's work has previously uncovered a range of intriguing links between what people look for online and their behaviour in the real world. Recent results revealed that changes in how frequently people searched for financial information on Google and Wikipedia could be interpreted as early signs of stock market moves, and that internet users in countries with a higher per capita GDP search for more information about the future.\"Our steadily increasing use of digital technology is opening up new and fruitful ways to document and follow human actions,\" said Dr Preis. \"Building on our recent work, we asked whether data from photos uploaded to Flickr could have been used to measure the impact of Hurricane Sandy.\"Our new results show that the greatest number of photos taken with Flickr titles, descriptions or tags including the words 'hurricane', 'sandy' or 'Hurricane Sandy' were taken in exactly the hour which Hurricane Sandy made landfall in New Jersey.\"Examination of the number of Hurricane Sandy related photos taken before and after landfall reveals a striking correlation with environmental measurements of the development of the hurricane.\"Dr Moat added: \"As the severity of a hurricane in a given area increases, atmospheric pressure drops. We found that as atmospheric pressure in New Jersey fell to its worst lows, the number of photos taken rose, and as atmospheric pressure in New Jersey climbed again, the number of photos taken fell.\"Plotting the data revealed that the number of photos taken increased continuously while 'Sandy' was moving towards the coast of the US. This study would suggest that in cases where no external sensors are available, it may be possible to use the number of Flickr photos relating to a topic to gauge the current level of this category of problems.\"Flickr can be considered as a system of large scale real-time sensors, documenting collective human attention. Increases in Flickr photo counts with particular labels may reveal notable increases in attention to a particular issue, which in some cases may merit further investigation for policy makers.\"Appropriate leverage of such online indicators of large disasters could be useful to policy makers and others charged with emergency crisis management: in particular if no secondary environmental measures are available.\""}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_299", "content": "Sandy caused 40 deaths and massive damage in New York City -- yet future storms could be worse, according to Benimoff and his colleagues. At the 2013 Geological Society of America (GSA) meeting in Denver, they will describe how the combination of rising sea level and more frequent, more severe hurricanes could bring Atlantic water much higher.Their new flood model predicts that Staten Island and Long Island would again flood in low-lying areas, such as South Beach, with their working-class neighborhoods and beachfront boardwalks, and could even surpass Sandy levels. In Manhattan, the storm surge could extend past the low areas that flooded in Sandy, which included Battery Park subway tunnels, the Financial District, and a 14th Street electrical substation.The researchers are geology professors Benimoff and William J. Fritz; Michael Kress, director of the CUNY Interdisciplinary High Performance Computer Center, vice president for technology systems, and professor of computer science; and undergraduate student Liridon Sela.Since Sandy, Benimoff and Fritz, who is interim president of College of Staten Island, have been active in the community discussions about how -- or whether -- to rebuild on the most vulnerable parts of the barrier islands. They have developed five recommendations for area policy makers, emergency agencies and residents.In public discussions, Benimoff does not mince words. As a scientist, he says, he has an obligation to communicate data clearly to non-scientists.\"To paraphrase our governor: There are some parcels of land that Mother Nature owns, and when she comes to visit, she visits,\" Benimoff says. \"The reality is that these particular barrier islands are uniquely vulnerable to storm surges. They have a lot of coastal and wetland that never should have been built on.\"What's more, they have a geometry of coastline where Coney Island and Sandy Hook make a right angle with Staten Island right at the apex, and the seafloor comes up very gradually. Water piles up in that corner and has nowhere to go but inland. That means any storm that comes perpendicular to the coastline of New Jersey is going to put us in harm's way.\"The College of Staten Island scientists' five-point plan recommends: 1. Protect the existing natural barriers -- the beaches and dunes; 2. Build them higher; 3. Rezone in the flood zone to prevent home construction. Buy these properties and turn them into parks, which will sponge up the inevitable floodwaters and partially protect the islands' higher lands. (There is precedent for this -- after 157 people died in 1946 and 1960 tsunamis in Hilo, Hawaii, the most damaged neighborhoods were turned into parks.) 4. Be very careful about engineering solutions such as sea barriers because they will not only be expensive but also protect one stretch of beach at the expense of its neighbor. \"Jetties, sandbars, seawalls -- these are merely Band-Aids,\" Benimoff says. \"You've got to face the music here.\" 5. Teach coastal residents how to survive a hurricane: Stay informed by watching weather forecasts. Evacuate early. Don't seek refuge in basements, which could flood. Know your area's high ground and, if faced with rapidly rising waters, go there."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_300", "content": "\"Rising sea levels exacerbate flooding,\" says Kemp. \"As sea level rises, smaller and weaker storms will cause flood damage.\" An assistant professor in Tufts' Department of Earth and Ocean Sciences, Kemp co-authored a study on sea-level change close to New York that was published recently in the Sandy hit New York as a team led by Kemp was researching sea-level change and flooding that had occurred in seven historically damaging hurricanes in New York since 1788. Last October, Sandy's storm surge hit the coast at high tide, but storm and tidal conditions were not the only cause of the devastation, Kemp says. Seawaters off New York's coast have risen 16 inches since 1778, the year of New York City's first major recorded storm, his research shows.To make this determination Kemp and his team studied salt-marsh sediments from Barnegat Bay in northern New Jersey, south of the tide gauge at Battery Park in New York. Using sediment cores, long cylinders drilled into the marsh floor that offer scientists a look back through time, they were able to reconstruct sea-level changes since 1788.Kemp cites two factors for rising seas. One is the natural sinking of land called glacio-isostatic adjustment. A second factor, and one supported by the latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), points to the melting of the ice-covered terrain of Greenland and Antarctic as well as the thermal expansion of ocean waters.Looking forward, Kemp sees the possibility of storms less powerful than Sandy inflicting serious damage. He uses a basketball analogy. \"It's like playing basketball and raising the level of the court so that shorter and shorter people can dunk. It makes low lying property and infrastructure more vulnerable at a time when developers are pumping money into coastal cities and towns.\""}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_301", "content": "Quirk, an assistant professor in the Department of Biodiversity, Earth and Environmental Science at Drexel University, had been performing wetland research for several years at monitoring sites in Barnegat and Delaware Bays in New Jersey. Recording devices installed at these sites continuously measured water level and salinity for a wide range of wetland studies at Drexel and the Academy of Natural Sciences of Drexel University.As Sandy hit and water levels rose, those measurements continued.\"We have continuous data on how long these areas were flooded and how high the water rose at these sites,\" said Quirk.It was a stroke of good luck to have captured detailed measurements during a storm of this rare magnitude. Quirk recognized that the data could provide new answers to the questions she had been investigating about how wetland ecosystems sustain themselves and function. Now she could also learn how marshes responded to the severe disturbance effect of the storm.\"The prospect of future storms of this magnitude suggests that we will need to understand their effects on ecosystem dynamics as part of the 'new normal,'\" Quirk said.In February she began working on an intensive year-long project, funded by the National Science Foundation, to evaluate ecosystem processes in New Jersey's salt marshes before, during, and for a year following Hurricane Sandy. Quirk is beginning to analyze findings from the study now.There was some good news from the marshes: Although some water-level recorders were over-topped and stopped recording (making it difficult to use direct measures of the water height), there was evidence of marsh swelling during the storm. That swelling is an indication of marshes' ability to absorb some of the storm surge -- which, in hard-hit urban areas, had resulted in high water marks up to seven feet during Hurricane Sandy. Quirk points out that resilient, healthy wetlands near coastal areas have a key role in protecting local communities from hurricane-induced storm surges and flooding.\"Imagine having a marsh in front of your house instead of concrete,\" Quirk said. \"Paved areas make flooding worse because water has nowhere to go.\"In her post-Sandy research, Quirk was interested in finding out whether the storm affected how the marshes sustain themselves. The disturbance of an intense storm could alter the delicate equilibrium between flooding, vegetation growth and sediment deposits in wetland ecosystems -- either temporarily or long-term.That's where the bad news comes in. As she works through the data analysis this fall, Quirk said she hasn't found much sign of sediment deposits, before or after the hurricane struck. Sandy had the potential to deposit a lot of sediments, fast, which would have been good for building up wetlands. Hurricane Irene in 2011 had been associated with a bump up in wetland accretion by several millimeters at a number of locations in the region -- a bonus growth equivalent to the amount that typically accrues in an entire year.\"Sediment-limited systems like coastal lagoon marshes largely depend on deposition by storms to vertically adjust elevation, so they don't sink relative to sea level,\" Quirk said. \"In places where we have ongoing monitoring, the evidence suggests that some sites are subsiding -- sinking below the surface -- rather than increasing elevation at a rate similar to local sea level rise. Surface deposition would be a good thing for these marshes.\"Any number of reasons could explain why those hoped-for sediment deposits didn't materialize, she said. Maybe the unusually high tide during Hurricane Sandy caused less suspension of sediments in the storm-surge waters. Or maybe the storm water did carry sediments and plant debris, but dropped them on the barrier island or inland along the tree line and not at her sampling sites in the marsh interior.Whatever the reason, Quirk's findings point to cause for continued concern over the coastal marshes' future.\"These salt marshes provide a number of extremely valuable ecosystem services and benefits to society,\" she said. Storm surge protection is just one of these. Coastal marshes also provide excellent habitat for commercially and recreationally important fish and shellfish, especially as a nursery ground for these animals. They're also important for storing, transforming and removing nutrients that can be harmful to the aquatic ecosystems.The areas of tidal wetlands remaining in New Jersey have been sharply reduced in proportion to the past, with surrounding areas built up with bulkheads and other development -- making the remaining wetlands all the more crucial to protect because they cannot shift inland.\"With accelerating sea level rise, it is unknown how many of these marshes are going to be able to keep up because they are dependent on plant growth, which is a slow process,\" Quirk said.\"Since 2010, the northern area of Barnegat Bay and the marsh on the bayside of the barrier island at Island Beach State Park is converting before our eyes from marsh to open water.\""}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_302", "content": "One key to the company's effective response was its setup of a weather event management team, an ad hoc group that set planning priorities as the storm approached the United States, ensuring the protection of personnel and equipment in hurricane's path.More surprisingly, as landfall was imminent, the company's schedulers were able to provide an especially fast response to changing conditions by bypassing normal communications channels that relied on technology. Instead, they spoke to each other face-to-face or directly on the phone to speed the exchange of information about time-critical issues.The researchers were already studying the company when Sandy occurred almost exactly a year ago. David Woods, professor of integrated systems engineering at Ohio State, and doctoral students David Deary and Katherine Walker spent time in its command centers and field operations throughout 2012. The company asked that its name be withheld from the study results.\"It was an opportunity for us to see resilience in action at an organizational scale,\" Woods said. \"When this hurricane struck the northeast -- an area of the U.S. that's very sensitive to transportation disruptions -- it provided a salient example of how organizations need to be prepared for challenging events in our interconnected world.\"They reported the results of the study on Oct. 3, at the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society meeting in San Diego.As technology continues to make the world more interconnected, businesses have to be more concerned with resilience, Woods said -- not just automakers, banks and utilities, but any company that relies on managing risk or digital assets or continuity of service for its customers. Financial, political and environmental threats emerge quickly, and aren't as easy to anticipate as a hurricane.Woods has long studied the issue of resilience, and is president of the Resilience Engineering Association -- an international professional organization \"facilitating the development of techniques to outmaneuver the complexities of today's world.\"He explained that businesses can react to disruptions one of two ways -- they can go completely rigid and stop providing services, or remain flexible and continue to provide services whenever or as long as possible.The company under study uses flexibility to compete in its area of the transportation industry. So the company remained open and accommodated emerging customer requests until it had to stop to ensure personnel safety and protect its equipment.As meteorologists tracked Sandy's approach across the Atlantic, the company set up a weather event management team to connect experts and decision makers who had the authority to commit the company's resources or accept risk for meeting individual customer requests in the northeast. It scheduled a complete shutdown of services for the time when the hurricane would make landfall.Until then? \"They were scrambling to do everything they wanted to get done,\" Deary said. As one senior employee in a command center told him, \"The actual storm is not a crisis -- getting ready for the storm is a crisis.\" During this time, the company adopted strategies to speed communication and decision-making.\"It may seem counterintuitive, but in order to speed things up, they stepped back from electronic communication. When an issue was important, they actually walked around the command center and talked to each other directly,\" Deary observed.To save time, the schedulers in the command center were also given the authority to make critical decisions, such as those concerning asset movement and protection, without seeking prior approval of senior managers. This approach was successful because of the schedulers' keen awareness of management's priorities in responding to the event.Ultimately, the company suffered no human injuries or significant equipment damage. It met many, though not all, last-minute customer requests before Sandy arrived, and appeared to meet customer expectations for restoration of service after the storm passed, the researchers concluded.\"This study suggests that a business doesn't have to be perfect, but if it's flexible -- if it's clear to customers that you're trying to be flexible in accommodating them, you succeed in the long run, and stakeholders look at you in a positive way,\" he said.This study is just one of many where Ohio State students are learning to help organizations become more resilient. He also helps lead a university-wide Initiative on Complexity in Natural, Social and Engineered Systems -- a 10-college collaboration which aims to develop certificate programs in complexity. Through collaborations with the John Glenn School of Public Affairs, the initiative is providing computer modeling tools that Ohio State students will use to study interconnected systems and guide new research."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_303", "content": "This research, published in Though scientists are in near-unilateral agreement that human activity contributes to climate change, the relationship isn't as clear to many politicians and citizens. This translates into lackluster support for environmental policies, especially when the short-term consequences amount to higher taxes.\"Americans tend to vote more from a self-interested perspective rather than demand that their government affect change,\" says lead researcher Laurie Rudman of Rutgers University.In 2010, Rudman and her colleagues Meghan McLean and Martin Bunzl surveyed over 250 Rutgers undergraduate students, measuring their attitudes toward two politicians, one who favored and another who opposed environmental policies that involve tax increases. The researchers asked the students whether they believed that humans are causing climate change, and they also had the students complete a test intended to reveal their automatic, instinctual preferences toward the politicians.Though most students said they preferred the green politician, their automatic preferences suggested otherwise. The automatic-attitudes test indicated that the students tended to prefer the politician who did not want to raise taxes to fund environment-friendly policy initiatives.After Hurricanes Irene and Sandy devastated many areas on the Eastern Seaboard in 2012, Rudman and colleagues wondered whether they would see any differences in students' attitudes toward environmental policies.\"It seemed likely that what was needed was a change of 'heart,'\" Rudman explains. \"Direct, emotional experiences are effective for that.\"In contrast with the first group, students tested in 2012 showed a clear preference for the green politician, even on the automatic attitudes test. And those students who were particularly affected by Hurricane Sandy -- experiencing power outages, school disruptions, even damaged or destroyed homes -- showed the strongest preference for the green politician.\"Not only was extreme weather persuasive at the automatic level, people were more likely to base their decisions on their gut-feelings in the aftermath of Sandy, compared to before the storm,\" Rudman explains.While they don't know whether the first group of students would have shown a shift in attitudes after the storms, the researchers believe their findings provide evidence that personal experience is one factor that can influence instinctive attitudes toward environmental policy. If storms do become more prevalent and violent as the climate changes, they argue, more people may demand substantive policy changes.Waiting for severe storms to shift the public's opinions on policy changes might be a sobering reality, but Rudman and her colleagues are more optimistic.\"Our hope is that researchers will design persuasion strategies that effectively change people's implicit attitudes without them having to suffer through a disaster,\" Rudman concludes."}

Cooler ocean temperatures mean less energy for hurricanes to form and strengthen.\"Dust activity has been very intense this year and sea surface temperatures are unusually low,\" Prospero says. \"These may have been contributing factors to the unusually weak hurricane season this year.\"A better understanding of all the processes involved in Saharan air outbreaks would help create models that can predict future trends.\"The question is what happens with climate change,\" Prospero says. \"Although much of North Africa is expected to get drier, which would mean more dust, models can't agree on whether the climate in the current major dust sources will get drier or wetter in the future\" he says. \"We are still trying to understand what drives these differences and the possible impacts.\"Prospero and his collaborator from the University of Puerto Rico make practical recommendations for the creation of a cooperative project that include long-term measurements of African dust occurrences in the Caribbean Basin, in a recent study published in the journal of American Meteorological Society. The scientists hope this collaborative effort will lead to a better understanding of the range and complexity of Saharan dust storms and the impact of African dust on climate and human health."}

Delft University of Technology (The Netherlands), Royal HaskoningDHV and Iv Infra are exploring possible designs for a flood barrier off the coast of Houston.Immediately after Hurricane Ike, Professor Bill Merrell of the Texas A&M University developed and unveiled the 'Ike Dike' concept. A key element of the concept is a movable flood barrier that can seal off the bay near Galveston and Houston during a hurricane. Under normal conditions the bay provides a passage to the Port of Houston, so it must remain accessible for shipping. Another matter of great importance is the preservation of the ecosystems in the bay. Which types of flood barriers are buildable to protect the Houston/Galveston area optimally against storm surges? This is the question that the Delft University of Technology, Royal HaskoningDHV and Iv-Infra are currently examining on behalf of principals in Texas.Over the past months the Delft University of Technology, Royal HaskoningDHV and Iv-Infra have worked out some flood defence concepts for closing off the approximately three kilometres long opening and have presented them to Bill Merrell and his team. In terms of their dimensions the barriers are similar to the Maeslant and Eastern Scheldt storm surge barriers in the Netherlands. The various concepts were compared with each other in respect of criteria like reliability, makeability, maintainability and life-cycle costs. The three parties will elaborate the preferred variants in greater detail in the coming period. A joint research programme will also be set up between the Delft University of Technology and the Texan universities."}

Braun, HS3 principal investigator and a research meteorologist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md.Two Global Hawks are flying as part of HS3, short for NASA's Hurricane and Severe Storm Sentinel mission, this year out of NASA's Wallops Flight Facility at Wallops Island, Va. Global Hawk aircraft are well-suited for hurricane investigations because they can fly for as long as 28 hours and over-fly hurricanes at altitudes greater than 60,000 feet (18.3 km).One of the purposes of the HS3 mission is to address the controversial role of the Saharan Air Layer in tropical storm formation and intensification. On its first flight out of Wallops, a Global Hawk obtained data about the SAL using several instruments aboard.The Cloud Physics Lidar, or CPL, instrument analyzed the SAL and showed an elevated dust layer between about 1.5 and 2.8 miles (2.5 and 4.5 km) overrunning the remnants of Erin. The low-level clouds associated with what was left of Erin were located below 1.2 miles (2 km).The CPL is an airborne lidar system designed specifically for studying clouds and aerosols. CPL will study cloud- and dust-layer boundaries and will provide optical depth or thickness of aerosols and clouds.Another instrument aboard the Global Hawk measured temperature and dewpoint. \"The scanning High-resolution Interferometer Sounder showed very dry air over the remnants of Erin,\" Braun said.The Global Hawk is expected to make another trip to analyze the Saharan Air Layer on Aug. 24-25.HS3 is a mission that brings together several NASA centers with federal and university partners to investigate the processes that underlie hurricane formation and intensity change in the Atlantic Ocean basin. Among those factors, HS3 will address the controversial role of the hot, dry and dusty Saharan Air Layer in tropical storm formation and intensification and the extent to which deep convection in the inner-core region of storms is a key driver of intensity change.The HS3 mission will operate between Aug. 20 and Sept. 23. The Atlantic hurricane season runs from June 1 to Nov. 30 and usually peaks in early to mid-September.Wallops is one of several NASA centers involved with the HS3 mission. The Earth Science Projects Office at NASA's Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, Calif., manages the project. Other participants include Goddard, NASA's Dryden Flight Research Center in Edwards, Calif., NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala., and NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif.The HS3 mission is funded by NASA Headquarters in Washington and managed by NASA's Earth System Science Pathfinder Program at NASA's Langley Research Center in Hampton, Va., and is one of five large field campaigns operating under the Earth Venture program. The HS3 mission also involves collaborations with various partners including the National Centers for Environmental Prediction; Naval Postgraduate School; Naval Research Laboratory; the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Hurricane Research Division and Earth System Research Laboratory; Northrop Grumman Space Technology; National Center for Atmospheric Research; State University of New York at Albany; University of Maryland, Baltimore County; University of Wisconsin; and University of Utah."}

The areas to be remapped will be based on their relative dangers to navigation, effects from the storm, and discussions with state and local officials as well as the maritime industry.\"Our approach is to map once, then use the data for many purposes,\" said NOAA Rear Admiral Gerd Glang, director of NOAA's Office of Coast Survey. \"Under the Ocean and Coastal Mapping Integration Act, NOAA and its federal partners are taking a 'whole ocean' approach to get as much useful information as possible from every dollar invested to help states build more resilient coastlines.\"The data, much of which will be stored at NOAA's National Geophysical Data Center, and through NOAA's Digital Coast, will be open to local, state, and federal agencies as well as academia and the general public. The information can be applied to updating nautical charts, removing marine debris, replenishing beaches, making repairs, and planning for future storms and coastal resilience.The three federal agencies are collaborating for greater topographic and hydrographic coverage and to promote efficiency. Earlier this year, a NOAA navigation response team surveyed the waters around Liberty Island and Ellis Island in New York harbor, measuring water depths and searching for debris that could cause a danger to navigation. Also, NOAA Ship NOAA plans to contract with commercial firms for additional hydrographic survey projects and high resolution topographic and bathymetric elevation data and imagery in the region.The U.S. Geological Survey will collect very high-resolution elevation data to support scientific studies related to the hurricane recovery and rebuilding activities, watershed planning and resource management. USGS will collect data in coastal and inland areas depending on their hurricane damages and the age and quality of existing data. The elevation data will become part of a new initiative, called the 3D Elevation Program, to systematically acquire improved, high-resolution elevation data across the United States.\"The human deaths and the powerful landscape-altering destruction caused by Hurricane Sandy are a stark reminder that our nation must become more resilient to coastal hazards,\" said Kevin Gallagher, associate director for Core Science Systems at USGS. \"Sandy's most fundamental lesson is that storm vulnerability is a direct consequence of the elevation of coastal communities in relation to storm waves. Communities will benefit greatly from the higher resolution and accuracy of new elevation information to better prepare for storm impacts, develop response strategies, and design resilient and cost-efficient post-storm redevelopment.\"The Army Corps of Engineers and its Joint Airborne Lidar Bathymetry Technical Center of Expertise are covering particular project areas in Massachusetts, Virginia, and New Jersey. They will coordinate operations, research, and development in airborne lidar bathymetry and complementary technologies for USACE, NOAA, and the U.S. Navy.Preliminary U.S. damage estimates are near $50 billion, making Sandy the second-costliest cyclone to hit the United States since 1900. There were at least 147 direct deaths recorded across the Atlantic basin due to Sandy, with 72 of these fatalities occurring in the mid-Atlantic and northeastern United States. This is the greatest number of U.S. direct fatalities related to a tropical cyclone outside of the southern states since Hurricane Agnes in 1972."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_308", "content": "Launched on July 23, 2001, the satellite lasted well beyond its original operational design life of two years for on-orbit storage and five years of actual operations to support forecasters and scientists in NOAA's National Weather Service.\"GOES-12 gave the Western Hemisphere many years of reliable data as the operational eastern GOES for accurate forecasts, from small storms to those of historic proportions,\" said Mary Kicza, assistant administrator for NOAA's Satellite and Information Service.Built by Space Systems/Loral, GOES-12 became operational April 1, 2003 as the GOES-East satellite, monitoring weather across the U.S. East Coast and part of the Atlantic Ocean. On May 10, 2010, when GOES-12 was no longer able to be maintained to meet the requirements of the National Weather Service, it was shifted to a new position, where it provided coverage of weather conditions affecting South America, including volcanic ash clouds, wildfires, and drought.When NOAA decommissions a geostationary satellite like GOES-12, it is boosted further into orbit, the remaining fuel is expended, the battery is disabled and the transmitters are turned off. These maneuvers reduce the chances the satellite will collide with other operational spacecraft. Additionally, decommissioning lowers the risk of orbital debris and stops the satellite from transmitting any signals that could interfere with any current or future spacecraft.Hovering 22,300 miles above the Equator, NOAA continues to operate GOES-13, which serves as the GOES East satellite for the United States and GOES-15, which is the GOES West satellite. NOAA also has an orbital backup geostationary satellite, GOES-14, which can be activated if any of the operational satellites experience trouble.Kicza added: \"The NOAA-NASA partnership is making steady progress toward developing and launching the more advanced GOES-R satellite series to position us into the future.\"GOES-R is expected to more than double the clarity of today's GOES imagery and provide more atmospheric observations than current capabilities with more frequent images.Data from the GOES-R instruments will be used to create many different products that will help NOAA meteorologists and other users monitor the atmosphere, land, ocean and the sun. GOES-R will also carry a new Geostationary Lightning Mapper that will provide for the first time a continuous surveillance of total lightning activity throughout the Americas and adjacent oceans.In addition to GOES, NOAA also operates the polar operational environmental satellite (POES) program satellites, the Defense Meteorological Satellites Program series satellites and the Suomi NPP spacecraft."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_309", "content": "That's the conclusion of a new study by a team of University of Notre Dame researchers led by Joannes Westerink, chair of the department of civil and environmental engineering and earth sciences and co-developer of the authoritative computer model for storm surge used by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the state of Louisiana to determine water levels due to hurricane surge and to design levee heights and alignments.The lower Mississippi River south of New Orleans protrudes into the Gulf of Mexico, andhu man-made levees line the west bank of the river for 55 kilometers of what is known as the Lower Plaquemines section. There are no levees on the east side of this stretch of the river. Westerink points out that, historically, sustained easterly winds from hurricanes have directed storm surge across Breton Sound into the Mississippi River and against its west bank levees.\"This study clearly shows that the man-built west bank levees on the lower Mississippi River enhance the capture of storm surge by the river,\" Westerink said. \"The surges are generated by the prevalent easterly winds that are common for regional hurricanes, but they spill into the river. These surges then propagate upriver, endangering New Orleans from the river side.\"As an alternative, the study shows that the lowering of human-made levees along the Lower Plaquemines river section to their natural state, to allow storm surge to partially pass across the Mississippi River, will decrease storm surge upriver toward New Orleans.\"By eliminating the 55 kilometers of human-made levees on the west bank of the river from Pointe a la Hache and Venice, the surges propagating in the river from Pointe a la Hache past New Orleans will be lowered by up to two meters,\" Westerink said. \"This would save billions of dollars in levee construction to protect communities upriver from Pointe a la Hache.\"The study also shows that the size of surges captured by the river actually decreases with a high-stage river.\"While higher flow and stages on the river do cause the storm surge to rise on top of the river water levels, causing overall higher water levels for a specific hurricane, the storm surge does not simply linearly add to the pre-storm river water levels,\" Westerink said. \"In fact, the surges captured by the river reduce as the river water levels rise.\"The researchers are aware that eliminating the human-made levees on the west bank might potentially endanger the few sparsely populated areas along the lower west bank of the Mississippi.\"For the few communities south of the Pointe a la Hache, the study suggests building strong and high ring citadel levees around them and then connecting these communities with a bridge, much as the Florida Keys are,\" Westerink said.The researchers note that, historically, the design of Southeast Louisiana's hurricane flood risk reduction system has hinged on raising and adding levees in response to river or hurricane events that impact the region. Now, it may be time to think and build smarter.\"The study suggests building smarter citadel flood protection systems in the delta instead of long north-south linear systems that follow the river,\" Westerink said. \"This reduces flooding risk, works with nature in that sediments can get to the delta from both the river and from hurricanes and thus build up the delta, and reduces levee construction costs by billions.\"The group's study appears in the Journal of Waterway, Port, Coastal and Ocean Engineering."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_310", "content": "The Department of Homeland Security's National Infrastructure Simulation and Analysis Center (NISAC), jointly housed at Sandia and Los Alamos national laboratories, studies how hurricanes and other disasters disrupt critical infrastructure, such as roads, electricity and water systems.Hurricane season began June 1 and runs through Nov. 30. It generally peaks in August and September, notwithstanding Superstorm Sandy's appearance late last October.With the onset of hurricane season, NISAC has two jobs: conducting annual \"hurricane swath\" analyses of probable impacts on the Gulf Coast and East Coast and providing quick analyses of crisis response in the face of an imminent hurricane threat to the United States.A swath analysis looks at how a hurricane might interrupt critical services and at impacts to infrastructure specific to an area, such as petroleum and petrochemical industries in Houston or financial services in New York City. It also looks at such things as the economic impact of the storm or how it could upset food deliveries.Federal officials pull swath analyses off the shelf when a hurricane seems likely to hit a particular place. They used the New Orleans report a few days before Hurricane Isaac headed toward that city last August.\"While it was too far out for us to do our analysis, they could use the report as a first cut,\" said Dan Pless, NISAC program lead at Sandia.NISAC's portfolio includes a dozen swath analyses updated every few years, two cities at a time. A team coordinated by Mark Pepple, NISAC fast response lead, this year updated reports for Houston and Corpus Christi, Texas; last year the work focused on Miami and Tampa. Updates keep information from becoming too stale, Pless said.NISAC came up with the original analyses, but is working on updates with state and local officials and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) agencies, including the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).Each report uses a \"reasonable bad scenario\" that would be possible in the particular area, with local officials deciding what scenario would be most useful for disaster planning, said Pless and Pepple. For example, a Category 5 hurricane isn't likely in New York City because colder waters dampen hurricane strength, but a Category 3 is within reason.\"These storms form in the Caribbean, they form in the Gulf. They can get quite strong down there,\" Pless said. \"They don't form in the North Atlantic. They have to travel there.\"The analyses -- also useful in other natural disasters -- consider impacts to the infrastructure, the population and the economy, Pless said.\"We look at where power outages are likely,\" he said. \"For Houston, it would examine the possible national impact on petroleum supplies and whether we should worry about that.\"They look at so-called food deserts: urban areas where food delivery might be interrupted, he said.NISAC also has found that some local officials want more demographic information. Officials in Florida, with its high retiree population, want to know where the elderly are concentrated, Pless said.The most difficult part of an analysis is defining a scenario because every place is different and a wide range of agencies must reach consensus, he said.Once NISAC is activated, the team focuses on exactly what's in the storm's projected path.\"Anytime a hurricane is going to make landfall in the U.S. we're busy at some level. If it's going to be a Category 3 or higher, you can pretty much figure we're going to go to full activation,\" Pless said. The decision whether to activate and to what degree comes from NISAC's program manager at the DHS.Pepple helps lead NISAC's crisis response. When federal officials activate a team, he coordinates with DHS and Sandia's partners at Los Alamos, which has its own team doing analyses. The labs collaborate. For example, Los Alamos models and analyzes the impacts to electricity and metropolitan water systems, and Sandia uses those results to look at impacts to energy such as petroleum and natural gas or sectors such as transportation and banking.He's also responsible for getting Sandia's team together, not just pulling in people, but identifying what expertise or simulation tools are needed. While a crisis response team always needs at least one economist to assess economic impact, a hurricane in Houston would require more analyses of the petrochemical sector than a hurricane in North Carolina, where agriculture could be a larger concern.NISAC and DHS collaborate on how much time the team has before it locks in a prediction of the hurricane's track toward land. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration issues regular landfall projections. At some point, NISAC has to lock in a storm track, or prediction, on which to base analyses.The amount of time for analysis is shrinking, Pless said. NISAC had 48 hours for Hurricane Gustav, which hit the South in late August and early September 2008.\"They said that's too much time, the track can change too much in that time,\" Pless said.The team had 24 hours to do its analysis for Hurricane Ike, which hit the Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi coasts in September 2008. By the time Irene hit the East Coast in August 2011, the deadline had dropped to 12 hours. \"We're roughly around 10 to 11 hours at this point,\" Pless said.The team provides similar information as for a swath analysis, with less detail but using the hurricane's strength and what's in its path. Sometimes the team adds a caveat that damage could be worse if the storm changes path.The team also responds to a flurry of questions from DHS just before landfall. For Ike, Pless said, officials wanted to know which large Houston-area water treatment plants were most likely to lose power and would need one of three available FEMA generators.For Sandy, NISAC's report identified subways in the storm surge zone and did some power outage modeling. NISAC's analyses complement those done by the Department of Energy or other agencies by providing unique evaluations of how damage to one type of infrastructure, such as power lines, would impact other infrastructures. As the designated sector-specific agency for the energy infrastructure sector, DOE's Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability helps prepare for and respond to energy-related emergencies like Hurricane Sandy.Questions to the team usually spike after a hurricane hits. That was particularly true for Sandy.\"You had this massive power outage and they were wondering, 'OK, we have these cell towers and a lot of them have diesel generators for backup. Those last 48 to 72 hours and the power isn't coming back in 48 to 72 hours. How do we prioritize that? Few of the gas stations have fuel, what's going on? Is it that they don't have power or because eight of the nine fuel delivery terminals in New Jersey were down?'\" Pless recalled.Sandy reversed the normal workload. \"Usually we have a lot heavier workload going into the hurricane before landfall and generally have tired people and a lighter workload afterward. On Sandy, we worked the opposite. We had a relatively light workload going in and then it got really busy,\" Pless said. \"That was because it was that weird perfect storm.\""}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_311", "content": "Erin is an example of a newly defined type of inland tropical cyclone that maintains or increases strength after landfall, according to NASA-funded research by Theresa Andersen and J. Marshall Shepherd of the University of Georgia in Athens.Before making landfall, tropical storms gather power from the warm waters of the ocean. Storms in the newly defined category derive their energy instead from the evaporation of abundant soil moisture -- a phenomenon that Andersen and Shepherd call the \"brown ocean.\"\"The land essentially mimics the moisture-rich environment of the ocean, where the storm originated,\" Andersen said.The study is the first global assessment of the post-landfall strength and structure of inland tropical cyclones, and the weather and environmental conditions in which they occur.\"A better understanding of inland storm subtypes, and the differences in the physical processes that drive them, could ultimately improve forecasts,\" Andersen said. \"Prediction and earlier warnings can help minimize damage and loss of life from severe flooding, high winds, and other tropical cyclone hazards.\"The study was published March 2013 in the To better understand tropical cyclones that survive beyond landfall, Andersen and Shepherd accessed data archived by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Climatic Data Center for tropical cyclones from 1979 to 2008. Storms had to meet the criteria of retaining a measureable central pressure by the time they tracked at least 220 miles (350 kilometers) inland, away from the maritime influence of the nearest coast. Next they obtained atmospheric and environmental data for before and after the storms from NASA's Modern Era Retrospective-Analysis for Research and Applications.Of the 227 inland tropical cyclones identified, 45 maintained or increased strength, as determined by their wind speed and central pressure. The researchers show, however, that not all such storms are fueled equally.In October 2012, Hurricane Sandy demonstrated the destructive power of extratropical cyclones -- a well-studied storm type that undergoes a known physical and thermal transition. These systems begin as warm-core tropical cyclones that derive energy from the ocean. Over land, the storms transition to cold-core extratropical cyclones that derive energy from clashes between different air masses. Of the study's 45 inland storms that maintained or increased strength, 17 belonged to this category.Tropical Storm Erin, however, is among the newly described storm category that accounted for 16 of the 45 tropical cyclones. Instead of transitioning from a warm-core to cold-core system, these storms maintain their tropical warm-core characteristics. The storm type, which Andersen and Shepherd call tropical cyclone maintenance and intensification events, or TCMIs, have the potential to deliver much more rainfall than their extratropical counterparts.\"Until events like Erin in 2007, there was not much focus on post-landfall tropical cyclones unless they transitioned,\" Andersen said. \"Erin really brought attention to the inland intensification of tropical cyclones.\"\"This is particularly critical since a study by former National Hurricane Center Deputy Director Ed Rappaport found that 59 percent of fatalities in landfalling tropical cyclones are from inland freshwater flooding,\" Shepherd said.While most inland tropical cyclones occur in the United States and China, the hotspot for TCMIs during the 30-year study period turned out to be Australia. The uneven geographic distribution led Andersen and Shepherd to investigate the environment and conditions surrounding the brown ocean phenomenon that gives rise to the storms.Andersen and Shepherd show that a brown ocean environment consists of three observable conditions. First, the lower level of the atmosphere mimics a tropical atmosphere with minimal variation in temperature. Second, soils in the vicinity of the storms need to contain ample moisture. Finally, evaporation of the soil moisture releases latent heat, which the team found must measure at least 70 watts averaged per square meter. For comparison, the latent heat flux from the ocean averages about 200 watts per square meter.Indeed, all three conditions were present when Erin tracked across the U.S. Gulf Coast and Midwest. Still, questions remain about the factors -- such as variations in climate, soil and vegetation -- that make Australia the region where brown ocean conditions most often turn up.The research also points to possible implications for storms' response to climate change. \"As dry areas get drier and wet areas get wetter, are you priming the soil to get more frequent inland tropical cyclone intensification?\" asked Shepherd."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_312", "content": "Before Hurricane Sandy landed on Oct. 29, 2012, a motorist traveling north on Ocean Avenue would seamlessly travel through Mantoloking into Bay Head, noticing few changes in residential development, dunes, beaches, and shoreline.The difference was hidden under the sand.A forgotten, 1,260-meter seawall buried beneath the beach helped Bay Head weather Sandy's record storm surges and large waves over multiple high tides, according to a team of engineers and geoscientists led by Jennifer L. Irish, an associate professor of civil and environmental engineering in the College of Engineering at Virginia Tech and an authority on storm surge, tsunami inundation, and erosion.The stone structure dates back to 1882. Its reappearance surprised many area residents, underscoring the difficulties transient communities have in planning for future threats at their shores, the researchers said.\"It's amazing that a seawall built nearly 150 years ago, naturally hidden under beach sands, and forgotten, should have a major positive effect under the conditions in which it was originally designed to perform,\" said H. Richard Lane, program director in the National Science Foundation's (NSF) Division of Earth Sciences, which funded the research. \"This finding should have major implications for planning, as sea level rises and storms increase in intensity in response to global warming.\"The discovery, now online in the journal \"Once we got there, we immediately saw the seawall,\" Irish said. \"The beach and dunes did their job to a certain point, then, the seawall took over, providing significant dampening of the waves. It was the difference between houses that were flooded in Bay Head and houses that were reduced to piles of rubble in Mantoloking.\"With recovery efforts under way and storms still circulating through the area, Irish and Robert Weiss, an assistant professor of geosciences in the College of Science at Virginia Tech, with Patrick Lynett, an associate professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of Southern California, documented high water marks, damage, overwash, and breaches of the barrier island.All oceanfront homes in the two boroughs were damaged, ranging from ground-floor flooding to complete destruction. As measured by water lines on the interior of homes, flooding was similar in both boroughs. The difference was the extent of the storm's impact.In Mantoloking, the entire dune almost vanished. Water washed over the barrier spit and opened three breaches of 165 meters, 59 meters, and 35 meters, where the land was swept away. In Bay Head, only the portion of the dune located seaward of the seawall was eroded and the section of dune behind the seawall received only minor local scouring.Later, using Google Earth to evaluate aerial images taken two years before and immediately after Hurricane Sandy, the research team evaluated houses, labeling a structure with a different roofline as damaged, one that no longer sits on its foundation as destroyed, and the remaining houses as flooded.The researchers classified 88 percent of the oceanfront homes in Bay Head as flooded, with just one oceanfront home destroyed. In Mantoloking, more than half of the oceanfront homes were classified as damaged or destroyed.Despite the immense magnitude and duration of the storm, a relatively small coastal obstacle reduced potential wave loads by a factor of two and was the difference between widespread destruction and minor structural impacts, the researchers said.\"We have a great deal of compassion for the people who have had to endure the devastation of Hurricane Sandy in Bay Head and Mantoloking,\" Irish said. \"It will have little solace, but we are left with a clear, unintentional example of the need for multiple levels of defense that include hard structures and beach nourishment to protect coastal communities.\"This research was supported by the National Science Foundation via grant EAR-1312813.Additional researchers include Wei Cheng of the Department of Geosciences and Stephanie Smallegan of the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Virginia Tech."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_313", "content": "Improved wind speed measurements could help meteorologists better predict the severity of storms and where they might be headed, said Stephen Katzberg, a Distinguished Research Associate at the NASA Langley Research Center in Hampton, Va., and a leader in the development of the new GPS technique. On a global scale, experts hope to use the new measurement method to better understand how storms form and what guides their behavior.The new technique could inexpensively provide a much more extensive view of a storm's wind speeds than currently possible, its developers say. Test flights on storm-hunting airplanes of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) -- nicknamed Hurricane Hunters -demonstrate that the system provides valuable information at little additional cost, according to Katzberg and his colleagues.An article describing the scientists' methods and findings has been accepted for publication in Radio Science, a journal of the American Geophysical Union.Hovering thousands of miles above Earth, GPS satellites constantly beam radio waves toward the ground carrying information about both the position of the satellite and the time the message was sent out. These radio waves can reflect off a surface similar to the way visible light reflects off a mirror.When a radio wave from a GPS satellite strikes the surface of a body of water, such as the ocean, about 60 percent of the signal reflects back toward the sky, Katzberg said. Unlike a mirror, however, the surface of the ocean is rarely calm and flat. Wind blowing over a body of water generates heaving waves.\"Imagine you blow on a hot bowl of soup,\" he explained. \"The harder you blow, the bigger the 'waves' are in the bowl.\" When a GPS signal strikes a wave, the rough surface distorts the reflection by scattering the signals in various directions.\"The radio wave bounces off the waves,\" said Katzberg. \"As the surface gets rougher, the reflections get more disturbed and that's what we measure.\"The new method of calculating wind speeds is the fruit of years of fine-tuning by scientists from NASA and NOAA, Katzberg added. In operation, the measurements are taken by GPS receiver chips, similar to those found in smartphones, located inside the aircraft. A computer compares signals coming directly from satellites above with the reflections from the sea below and calculates an approximate wind speed with better than 5 meters per second (about 11 miles per hour) accuracy. The wind speed of a mid-range, Category 3 hurricane, for comparison, is about 55 meters per second (123 miles per hour).In order to measure hurricane wind speeds using the standard method, scientists drop a 16-inch-long tube packed with scientific instruments called a dropsonde. These dropsondes are attached to small parachutes and jettisoned from airplanes, gathering information during their descent. Each device measures pressure, humidity and temperature in addition to wind speed. A typical Hurricane Hunter mission uses about 20 single-use dropsondes, each costing around $750.Dropsondes provide 10 times more precise wind speed measurements than the new GPS method can, so far. Their accuracy is about 0.5 meters per second (1.1 miles per hour).But, since the dropsondes are so expensive, their releases are spread out around and in storms. This distance means meteorologists need to use some guesswork to fill in the gaps. According to Katzberg, the reflected GPS signal system can essentially run non-stop, constantly gathering information about the wind below. The ultimate goal isn't to replace dropsondes, but rather to add a much broader view of wind speeds to the data the dropsondes provide.\"You were already going to have these GPS systems onboard, so why not get additional information about the environment around you,\" said Katzberg.Since the method requires large bodies of water to work, the system can't be used over land. Also, in cases where the ocean's surface is choppy without any wind, such as the eye of a storm, Katzberg says other tools would need to be used instead to get an accurate measurement.Although the new measurement technique is being tested on planes, it may get implemented on satellites, according to Katzberg. In 2016, NASA plans to launch a system of small satellites, called the Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System (CYGNSS), to measure reflected GPS satellite signals from low orbit to monitor storm wind speeds from space.And, looking further into the future, reflections of powerful satellite broadcasts from DirecTV and Sirius XM Radio could be used in addition to GPS.\"Those signals are extremely powerful and easy to detect,\" said Katzberg. \"These satellites cost hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars, but our system only costs a few hundred. We're taking advantage of the expensive infrastructure that's already there.\""}

Providing accurate predictions, though, is challenging because ENSO varies naturally over decades and centuries. Instrumental records are too short to determine whether any changes seen recently are simply natural or attributable to human-made greenhouse gases. Reconstructions of ENSO behavior are usually missing adequate records for the tropics where ENSO develops.Help is now underway in the form of a tree-ring record reflecting ENSO activity over the past seven centuries. Tree-rings have been shown to be very good proxies for temperature and rainfall measurements. An international team of scientists spearheaded by Jinbao Li and Shang-Ping Xie, while working at the International Pacific Research Center, University of Hawaii at Manoa, has compiled 2,222 tree-ring chronologies of the past seven centuries from both the tropics and mid-latitudes in both hemispheres. Their work is published in the June 30, 2013 online issue of The inclusion of tropical tree-ring records enabled the team to generate an archive of ENSO activity of unprecedented accuracy, as attested by the close correspondence with records from equatorial Pacific corals and with an independent Northern Hemisphere temperature reconstruction that captures well-known teleconnection climate patterns.These proxy records all indicate that ENSO was unusually active in the late 20th century compared to the past seven centuries, implying that this climate phenomenon is responding to ongoing global warming.\"In the year after a large tropical volcanic eruption, our record shows that the east-central tropical Pacific is unusually cool, followed by unusual warming one year later. Like greenhouse gases, volcanic aerosols perturb the Earth's radiation balance. This supports the idea that the unusually high ENSO activity in the late 20th century is a footprint of global warming,\" explains lead author Jinbao Li.\"Many climate models do not reflect the strong ENSO response to global warming that we found,\" says co-author Shang-Ping Xie, meteorology professor at the International Pacific Research Center, University of Hawaii at Manoa and Roger Revelle Professor at Scripps Institution of Oceanography, University of California at San Diego. \"This suggests that many models underestimate the sensitivity to radiative perturbations in greenhouse gases. Our results now provide a guide to improve the accuracy of climate models and their projections of future ENSO activity. If this trend of increasing ENSO activity continues, we expect to see more weather extremes such as floods and droughts.\""}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_315", "content": "The Saharan dust layer is composed of sand and other mineral particles that are swept up in air currents and whisked westward over the Atlantic Ocean. The extreme daytime heating of the Sahara creates instability in the lowest layer of the atmosphere, warming and drying the air near the surface and cooling and moistening the air near the top of the dust layer near 5 kilometers (16,500 feet). Once it exits the African coast, the dust-laden air moves over air that is cooler, and moister, and it's the temperature inversion of warm air over cold that prevents deep cloud development. This suppression of deep cloud formation along with the dry air within the dust layer is reasons why this Saharan air layer is sometimes thought to suppress tropical cyclone development. On the other hand, the southern boundary of this hot desert air essentially acts like a front whose attendant wind patterns are a major source of the African waves that are precursors to storm formation.Some Saharan dust has been known to make the journey across the Atlantic and to the U.S. east coast. But Saharan dust doesn't just cause sunrises to appear more reddish, the dust also impacts the development of clouds and precipitation. The dust particles can provide a surface for small cloud droplets and ice crystals to form within clouds. More dust particles means that a given amount of available water is spread onto more particles, creating large numbers of small drops and delaying the formation of larger raindrops. Those effects, coupled with the warm and dry air, have presented challenges to meteorologists who have been trying to understand the effect of Saharan dust on tropical cyclones.HS3 addresses the controversial role of the Saharan Air Layer, or SAL, in tropical storm formation and intensification by taking measurements from three instruments on board the Global Hawk. These instruments include a cloud physics lidar which uses a laser to measure vertical profiles of dust; a dropsonde system that releases small instrumented packages from the aircraft that fall to the surface while measuring profiles of temperature, humidity, and winds; and an infrared sounder that measures temperature and humidity in clear-sky regions.On Sept. 11 and 12, during the 2012 HS3 mission, the NASA Global Hawk aircraft covered more than one million square kilometers (386,100 square miles) going back and forth over the storm in a gridded fashion in what's called a \"lawnmower pattern.\"The SAL was present primarily during that first flight, and again on the flight from Sept. 14 to 15. \"The SAL did not act to suppress development on Sept. 11 and 12, at least not in the sense of a direct intrusion into the storm circulation, but it is too early to say what role it might have played in other ways and in other flights,\" said Scott Braun, HS3 Principal Investigator, at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Md. \"There is some evidence that it (the SAL) was getting into the storm circulation on Sept. 14 and 15, but the extent to which it impacted development is unclear.\"The dust data collected by the Global Hawk is important for scientific studies on the SAL. Other data was useful operationally to the National Hurricane Center (NHC), the entity that issues forecasts for tropical cyclones. The forecasters at the NHC used data from dropsondes released from the Global Hawk in the discussion of Nadine at 11 a.m. EDT on Sept. 20, \"The current intensity is kept at 45 knots (51.7 mph/83.3 kmh)â¦is in good agreement with dropsonde data from the NASA global hawk aircraft and AMSU [satellite instrument] estimates.\"Valuable data from the Global Hawk dropsondes on September 22-23 provided the National Hurricane Center with information that contributed to their reclassifying the storm as a tropical storm after one day of being called a post-tropical low. Shortly after HS3's last flight into Nadine on September 26-27, Nadine actually strengthened back into a hurricane and reached its maximum intensity.Dropsonde data from HS3's flight on September 26-27 showed that temperature and humidity conditions in the storm were becoming more favorable for the occurrence of deep thunderstorms. Infrared data from NASA's Aqua satellite on Sept. 28, 2012, revealed that strong convection and thunderstorms did build up again and strengthened Nadine back into a hurricane.HS3 is a five-year mission specifically targeted to investigate the processes that underlie hurricane formation and intensity change in the Atlantic Ocean basin.For NASA's storm history of Hurricane Nadine, visit: For more information about easterly waves, visit:"}

Densities above 50,000 cells per milliliter can be harmful to marine life.The brown tide alga, Dr. Christopher Gobler, a Professor within Stony Brook University's School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences whose laboratory generated the brown tide data, indicated that the distribution of this year's brown tide comes as good news to some and bad news to others.\"The absence of a brown tide in Great South Bay may be a 'Gift from Sandy',\" Gobler said. \"Since the new inlet was created following the Hurricane Sandy, we've seen higher salinity, lower chlorophyll, lower nitrogen, and stronger flushing in eastern Great South Bay. The inability of the brown tide organism to form a bloom in this region is consistent with these conditions and should help promote the growth of hard clams and eelgrass in this bay.\"The news for the eastern regions of the Long Island's south shore was not as good.\"The combination of poor flushing and intensive nitrogen loading into the eastern Moriches-western Shinnecock Bay region makes it highly vulnerable to algal blooms,\" said Gobler. \"We had hoped that the cooler spring and the efforts of the Shinnecock Bay Restoration Program to restock filter feeding shellfish in the Bay might restrict this year's bloom. We are still hopeful that these filter feeders may make this year's bloom less intense in this region than it has been in recent years,\" said Gobler noting that in 2011 and 2012, cell densities of the brown tide were more than twice as dense as the current bloom at two million cells per milliliter."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_317", "content": "The tiny, autonomous craft -- some fly, others dart under the waves -- can spy on hurricanes at close range without getting blown willy-nilly, while sensors onboard collect and send in real time the data scientists need to predict the intensity and trajectory of storms: pressure, temperature, humidity, location and time.Mohseni said people always ask him how the miniature flying machines -- just 6 inches long and about the weight of an iPod Nano -- can take on one of the monster storms.\"Our vehicles don't fight the hurricane; we use the hurricane to take us places,\" said Mohseni, the W.P. Bushnell Endowed Professor in the department of mechanical and aerospace engineering and the department of electrical and computer engineering.The aerial and underwater vehicles can be launched with commands from a laptop hundreds of miles from the eye of a hurricane. Mohseni and a team of graduate students use mathematical models to predict regions in the atmosphere and ocean that can give the vehicles a free ride toward their destination. Once in the vicinity, they can be powered off to wait for a particular current of wind or water. When they detect the current they need for navigation, they power back on, slip into the current, then power off again to conserve fuel as the current carries them to a target location.In essence, they can go for a fact-gathering ride on hurricane winds and waters.The devices are a departure from current technology, which uses hurricane reconnaissance aircraft to punch through a storm's eye wall and release dropsondes, sensors that free-fall and might or might not collect helpful data. Underwater data are even more difficult to collect today, although just as important, considering that the warm, moist air on the ocean surface provides fuel for hurricanes.Mohseni's vehicles, even launched hundreds at a time, also reduce the cost of hurricane reconnaissance.\"If you want to blast through a hurricane, you have to build a bigger airplane,\" Mohseni said. \"[The military] asks for a Batman airplane, a super-duper aircraft that could do everything. But what if you lose one of these super-duper airplanes?\"We are going the opposite direction. We don't have anything that is super duper. We have cheap sensors, but with a lot of them you can significantly increase the accuracy of your measurements,\" said Mohseni, director of UF's new Institute for Networked Autonomous Systems. \"You get super duper on an aggregate level.\"The prototypes produced at the institute are about $250 apiece and are too small and lightweight to cause damage when they hit something, a big consideration in hurricane-force winds and waves. Mohseni does not use a landing strip to test the aerial vehicles; he just tells them to crash, picks them up and flies them again. The carbon fiber shell of the aerial vehicles is wafer-thin but resilient. With proper funding, Mohseni said, the vehicles could be tested in a real-world hurricane in two or three years.In instances where many are lost -- as in a hurricane -- the data gained outweighs the cost of the lost vehicles, Mohseni said. Production costs would drop if the vehicles were mass-produced.The vehicles also are smart. Mohseni developed a cooperative control algorithm that allows them to form a network and learn from the data they take in, for example, by adjusting their course when needed. This feature makes them useful for applications beyond hurricanes.Extreme environments, such as the polar ice caps, are difficult and hazardous to measure with standard technology. Mohseni said heat transfer through polar ice between the ocean and the air goes almost completely unmeasured today but could be safely measured with the aerial vehicles, which can be launched from a laptop aboard a ship and send back climate data in real time.Vehicles so tiny, powerful and smart would have been far-fetched even 10 years ago, Mohseni said, but advances in microfabrication, communications, computer processing and computation have led to sophisticated technology in small packages. Nevertheless, Mohseni also has drawn inspiration from seemingly less-sophisticated sources, such as jellyfish.Mohseni had been studying fluid dynamics, working on propulsion, when a biologist mentioned that jellyfish navigate in much the same way as the mechanical system Mohseni wanted to develop. After studying jellyfish, cuttlefish and squid, Mohseni developed a mathematical model of their thrust and used that model to develop the motors for his underwater sensor vehicles. He now has small submarines capable of autonomous docking using technology mimicking jellyfish and squid, and the sea creatures are common fixtures in his laboratory.\"With biomimicry, learning from what nature does,\" Mohseni said, \"you just sort of get amazed.\""}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_318", "content": "Tim LaRow, associate research scientist at COAPS, and his colleagues released their fifth annual Atlantic hurricane season forecast today. Hurricane season begins June 1 and runs through Nov. 30.This year's forecast calls for a 70 percent probability of 12 to 17 named storms with five to 10 of the storms developing into hurricanes. The mean forecast is 15 named storms, eight of them hurricanes, and an average accumulated cyclone energy (a measure of the strength and duration of storms accumulated during the season) of 135.\"The forecast mean numbers are identical to the observed 1995 to 2010 average named storms and hurricanes and reflect the ongoing period of heightened tropical activity in the North Atlantic,\" LaRow said.The COAPS forecast is slightly less than the official National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) forecast that predicts a 70 percent probability of 13 to 20 named storms with seven to 11 of those developing into hurricanes this season.LaRow and his colleagues at COAPS use a numerical climate model developed at Florida State to understand seasonal predictability of hurricane activity. The model is one of only a handful of numerical models in the world being used to study seasonal hurricane activity. The forecast numbers are based on 50 individual seasonal atmospheric forecasts using sea surface temperatures predicted by a recently upgraded NOAA climate model.The COAPS model is already gaining recognition for its accuracy only four years after its launch. In 2012, the forecast predicted an average of 13 named storms and seven hurricanes, and there ended up being 19 named storms and 10 hurricanes.\"Last year was unusual in that El NiÃ±o did not develop as the climate model expected,\" LaRow said. \"El NiÃ±o develops when sea surface temperatures in the equatorial Pacific Ocean are warmer than normal, leading to increased wind shear in the Atlantic, which can disrupt developing tropical systems. Last year, El NiÃ±o never developed, and it is not predicted to develop this year.\"The 2011 forecast predicted an average of 17 named storms and nine hurricanes, and there were actually 19 named storms and seven hurricanes. The 2010 forecast predicted 17 named storms and 10 hurricanes, and there were actually 19 named storms and 12 hurricanes. The 2009 forecast predicted eight named storms and four hurricanes, and there ended up being nine named storms and three hurricanes that year.Reforecasts conducted using data since 1982 show that the model has a mean absolute error of 1.9 hurricanes and 2.3 named storms."}

Among those factors, HS3 will address the controversial role of the hot, dry and dusty Saharan Air Layer in tropical storm formation and intensification, and the extent to which deep convection in the inner-core region of storms is a key driver of intensity change.The HS3 mission will operate between Aug. 20 and Sept. 23. The Atlantic hurricane season runs from June 1 to November 30 and usually peaks in early to mid-September.The NASA Global Hawks are unmanned aircraft that will be piloted remotely from the HS3 mission base at NASA's Wallops Flight Facility in Wallops Island, Va. Global Hawk aircraft are well-suited for hurricane investigations because they can fly for as long as 28 hours and over-fly hurricanes at altitudes greater than 60,000 feet.The second Global Hawk will carry a payload of a Doppler radar for wind and precipitation measurements, a microwave radiometer for surface wind measurements, and a microwave sounder for the measurement of atmospheric temperature and humidity profiles. In addition, an instrument called ADELE (Airborne Detector for Energetic Lightning Emissions) is being added to examine gamma ray emissions caused by lightning. The ADELE instrument first flew on a Gulfstream V aircraft in 2009.The radar and microwave instruments will fly aboard Global Hawk Two for the first time in HS3 and will focus on the inner region of the storms. The High-Altitude Imaging Wind and Rain Airborne Profiler conically scanning Doppler radar, the Hurricane Imaging Radiometer, and the High-Altitude Monolithic Microwave Integrated Circuit Sounding Radiometer microwave sounder will be new to the mission this year. These instruments have previously participated in NASA's GRIP (Genesis and Rapid Intensification Processes) experiment that studied hurricanes during the 2010 season and represent advanced technologies developed by NASA that are precursors to potential future satellite sensorsThis year, one HS3 mission Global Hawk will provide the opportunity to test out a non-hurricane related instrument: the ADELE gamma ray detector.Making a return appearance to NASA Wallops for the 2013 season and flying on Global Hawk One are three instruments to examine the environment of the storms. The scanning High-resolution Interferometer Sounder, the Advanced Vertical Atmospheric Profiling System also known as dropsondes, and the Cloud Physics Lidar will be mounted in the Global Hawk that will be studying the environment around storms.Wallops Flight Facility is one of several NASA centers involved with the HS3 mission.

Strong winds, torrential rain, flooding, and tornadoes often threaten inland areas far from where the storm first makes landfall.\"Three climate factors that strongly control Atlantic hurricane activity are expected to come together to produce an active or extremely active 2013 hurricane season. These are:\"This year, oceanic and atmospheric conditions in the Atlantic basin are expected to produce more and stronger hurricanes,\" said Gerry Bell, Ph.D., lead seasonal hurricane forecaster with NOAA's Climate Prediction Center. \"These conditions include weaker wind shear, warmer Atlantic waters and conducive winds patterns coming from Africa.\"NOAA's seasonal hurricane outlook is not a hurricane landfall forecast; it does not predict how many storms will hit land or where a storm will strike. Forecasts for individual storms and their impacts will be provided throughout the season by NOAA's National Hurricane Center.New for this hurricane season are improvements to forecast models, data gathering, and the National Hurricane Center communication procedure for post-tropical cyclones. In July, NOAA plans to bring online a new supercomputer that will run an upgraded Hurricane Weather Research and Forecasting (HWRF) model that provides significantly enhanced depiction of storm structure and improved storm intensity forecast guidance.Also this year, Doppler radar data will be transmitted in real time from NOAA's Hurricane Hunter aircraft. This will help forecasters better analyze rapidly evolving storm conditions, and these data could further improve the HWRF model forecasts by 10 to 15 percent.The National Weather Service has also made changes to allow for hurricane warnings to remain in effect, or to be newly issued, for storms like Sandy that have become post-tropical. This flexibility allows forecasters to provide a continuous flow of forecast and warning information for evolving or continuing threats."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_321", "content": "Now a study headed by a team of scientists at the International Pacific Research Center, University of Hawaii at Manoa, shows that Hawaii could see a two-to-three-fold increase in tropical cyclones by the last quarter of this century. The study, which appears in the May 5, 2013, online issue of \"Computer models run with global warming scenarios generally project a decrease in tropical cyclones worldwide. This, though, may not be what will happen with local communities,\" says lead author Hiroyuki Murakami.To determine whether tropical cyclones will become more frequent in Hawaii with climate change, Murakami and climate expert Bin Wang at the Meteorology Department, University of Hawaii at Manoa, joined forces with Akio Kitoh at the Meteorological Research Institute and the University of Tsukuba in Japan. The scientists compared in a state-of-the-art, high-resolution global climate model the recent history of tropical cyclones in the North Pacific with a future (2075-2099) scenario, under which greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, resulting in temperatures about 2Â°C higher than today.\"In our study, we looked at all tropical cyclones, which range in intensity from tropical storms to full-blown category 5 hurricanes. From 1979 to 2003, both observational records and our model document that only every four years on average did a tropical cyclone come near Hawaii. Our projections for the end of this century show a two-to-three-fold increase for this region,\" explains Murakami.The main factors responsible for the increase are changes in the large-scale moisture conditions, the flow patterns in the wind, and in surface temperature patterns stemming from global warming.Most hurricanes that might threaten Hawaii now are born in the eastern Pacific, south of the Baja California Peninsula. From June through November the ingredients there are just right for tropical cyclone formation, with warm ocean temperatures, lots of moisture, and weak vertical wind shear. But during the storms' long journey across the 3000 miles to Hawaii, they usually fizzle out due to dry conditions over the subtropical central Pacific and the wind shear from the westerly subtropical jet.Surprisingly, even though fewer tropical cyclones will form in the eastern Pacific in Murakami's future scenario, we can expect more of them to make their way to Hawaii.The upper-level westerly subtropical jet will move poleward so that the mean steering flow becomes easterly. Thus, storms from Baja California are much more likely to make it to Hawaii. Furthermore, since the climate models also project that the equatorial central Pacific will heat up, conditions may become more favorable for hurricane formation in the open ocean to the south or southeast of Hawaii.\"Our finding that more tropical cyclones will approach Hawaii as Earth continues to warm is fairly robust because we ran our experiments with different model versions and under varying conditions. The yearly number we project, however, still remains very low,\" reassures study co-author Wang."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_322", "content": "Just ask the survivors of Hurricane Sandy.The 2012 hurricane was only a Category 2 storm on the often referenced Saffir-Simpson scale when it became the largest hurricane on record, killing 285 people in its path in seven different countries and becoming the second costliest in U.S. history. Likewise, Hurricane Katrina was a weaker storm than 1969's Camille but caused much more destruction even though the two hurricanes followed essentially the same path.The new metric, called Track Integrated Kinetic Energy (TIKE), builds on the concept of Integrated Kinetic Energy (IKE) developed in 2007 to more accurately measure the destructive potential of a storm. IKE involves using kinetic energy scales with the surface stress that forces storm surge and waves and the horizontal wind loads specified by the American Society of Civil Engineers. TIKE expands the concept by accumulating IKE over the lifespan of a tropical cyclone and over all named tropical cyclones in the hurricane season.\"Representing the activity of an Atlantic hurricane season by a number is a very difficult task,\" said Vasu Misra, an associate professor of meteorology in the Department of Earth, Ocean and Atmospheric Science and FSU's Center for Ocean-Atmospheric Prediction Studies (COAPS). \"TIKE gives a succinct picture by taking into account the number of tropical cyclones in the season, the duration of each tropical cyclone and the time history of the wind force over a large area surrounding each tropical cyclone. This makes TIKE much more reliable as an objective measure of the seasonal activity of the Atlantic hurricanes than existing metrics.\"Misra developed TIKE through a collaboration with Steven DiNapoli, a former COAPS data analyst, and Mark Powell, a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration atmospheric scientist currently stationed at COAPS who created IKE with a colleague six years ago. Their paper, \"The Track Integrated Kinetic Energy of the Atlantic Tropical Cyclones,\" was published in the American Meteorological Society's Misra, DiNapoli and Powell calculated TIKE for each hurricane season, including all named tropical cyclones in the Atlantic from 1990 through 2011, and found larger TIKE values during La NiÃ±a conditions and warm tropical Atlantic sea surface temperature conditions. The information will help them in developing a model that can predict TIKE for an entire season -- a prediction that could help emergency managers, businesses and residents with preparedness.\"I look forward to the global climate models improving enough to allow skillful predictions of storm size, which will help us predict TIKE for an upcoming season,\" Powell said. TIKE is not intended as an alternative to existing metrics but as a complimentary tool, the researchers said.The need for more information about the potential for destruction was brought home during the 2012 season. The Integrated Kinetic Energy calculation that TIKE is based on was more than 300 terajoules for Hurricane Sandy. The figure, which represents units of energy, was the largest IKE measurement for any hurricane between 1990 and 2006.\"That means that Sandy actually had more wind forcing over a large area than Hurricane Katrina,\" Misra said. \"If the public was aware that this number was so high, which is an indication of the large potential for damage from storm surge and waves, some of them might have been able to make better life- and property-saving decisions.\"Â This research was supported by grants from NOAA, the Southeast Ecological Science Center of the U.S. Geological Survey and the U.S. Department of Agriculture."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_323", "content": "\"We detected seismic waves created by the oceans waves both hitting the East Coast and smashing into each other,\" with the most intense seismic activity recorded when Sandy turned toward Long Island, New York and New Jersey, says Keith Koper, director of the University of Utah Seismograph Stations.\"We were able to track the hurricane by looking at the 'microseisms' [relatively small seismic waves] generated by Sandy,\" says Oner Sufri, a University of Utah geology and geophysics doctoral student and first author of the study with Koper. \"As the storm turned west-northwest, the seismometers lit up.\"Sufri was scheduled to present the preliminary, unpublished findings in Salt Lake City Thursday, April 18 during the Seismological Society of America's annual meeting.There is no magnitude scale for the microseisms generated by Sandy, but Koper says they range from roughly 2 to 3 on a quake magnitude scale. The conversion is difficult because earthquakes pack a quick punch, while storms unleash their energy for many hours.The shaking was caused partly by waves hitting the East Coast, but much more by waves colliding with other waves in the ocean, setting up \"standing waves\" that reach the seafloor and transmit energy to it, Sufri and Koper say.While many people may not realize it, earthquakes are not the only events that generate seismic waves. So do mining and mine collapses; storm winds, waves and tornadoes; traffic, construction and other urban activities; and meteors hitting Earth.\"They are not earthquakes; they are seismic waves,\" says Koper, a seismologist and associate professor of geology and geophysics. \"Seismic waves can be created by a range of causes. â¦ We have beautiful seismic records of the meteor that hit Russia. That's not an earthquake, but it created ground motion.\"While Sandy's seismicity may be news to many, Koper says microseisms just as strong were detected before and after the superstorm from North Pacific and North Atlantic storms that never hit land but created \"serious ocean wave action.\"Koper adds: \"Hurricane Katrina in 2005 was recorded by a seismic array in California, and they could track the path of the storm remotely using seismometers.\"In a related study set for presentation on Friday at the seismology meeting, Koper and geophysics undergraduate student YeouHui Wong found preliminary evidence that seismometers near Utah's Great Salt Lake are picking up seismic waves generated either by waves or winds on the lake.Koper says researchers wonder if microseisms from storms and other causes might trigger tiny but real earthquakes, but \"that hasn't been investigated yet,\" he says.The microseisms generated by Sandy were detected by Earthscope, a National Science Foundation-funded array of about 500 portable seismometers that were first placed in California in 2004 and have been leapfrogging eastward so that most now are located east of line running from Minnesota to east Texas, and west of a line from Lake Erie to Florida. Some remain scattered across the Midwest and West, with a heavier concentration in the Pacific Northwest.Earthscope's purpose is to use seismic waves from quakes and other sources to make images of Earth's crust and upper mantle beneath North America -- similar to how X-rays are used to make CT scans of the human body. To do it accurately, scientists must understand all sources of seismic waves.Sufri says the new study included Earthscope data from Oct. 18 to Nov. 3, 2012, \"which coincides with the passage of Hurricane Sandy, and we tried to understand microseisms that were generated.\"Sandy caused a damaging storm surge due to its size -- almost 1,100 miles in diameter for tropical-storm-force winds -- more than its intensity, which was 3 when it hit Cuba and 2 off the Northeast coast.\"The energy generated by Sandy is going to be used to image the crust and upper mantle under North America,\" says Koper, noting that Earthscope uses years of seismic data to construct images. \"We are using seismic waves created by ocean waves to make images of the continent.\"Normal ocean waves \"decay with depth very quickly,\" says Koper. But when Sandy turned, there was a sudden increase in waves hitting waves to create \"standing waves\" like those created when you throw two pebbles in a pond and the ripples intersect. \"Pressure generated by standing waves remains significant at the seafloor,\" he says.\"When Sandy made that turn to the northwest, although wind speeds didn't get dramatically bigger, the seismic energy that was created got tremendously bigger because the ocean's standing waves were larger from the wave-wave interaction,\" he adds.Not only did the seismic waves become more energetic, \"but the periods got longer so, in a sense, the sound of those seismic waves got deeper -- less treble, more bass -- as the storm turned,\" Koper says.Seismologists can track Sandy and other big storms because seismometers detect three components of motion: one vertical and two horizontal. If most of the energy on a seismometer is detected with a north-south motion, it means the source of the energy is north or south of the device.\"If you have enough seismometers, you can get enough data to get arrows to point at the source,\" Koper says.He says the seismologists didn't track Sandy in real time, but the seismographic data of the storm suggests it might be possible to help track storms in the future using their seismicity.Sufri speculates that seismic tracking of storms might allow observations that satellites can miss, and perhaps could help researchers \"understand how climate is changing and how it is affecting our oceans -- are we seeing more intense storms and increasing numbers of storms?\"Koper says the Sandy study \"is exploratory science where we are trying to learn fundamental things about how the atmosphere, oceans and solid Earth interact.\""}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_324", "content": "The results are published in the scientific journal, Tropical cyclones arise over warm ocean surfaces with strong evaporation and warming of the air. The typically form in the Atlantic Ocean and move towards the U.S. East Coast and the Gulf of Mexico. If you want to try to calculate the frequency of tropical cyclones in a future with a warmer global climate, researchers have developed various models. One is based on the regional sea temperatures, while another is based on differences between the regional sea temperatures and the average temperatures in the tropical oceans. There is considerable disagreement among researchers about which is best.\"Instead of choosing between the two methods, I have chosen to use temperatures from all around the world and combine them into a single model,\" explains climate scientist Aslak Grinsted, Centre for Ice and Climate at the Niels Bohr Institute at the University of Copenhagen.He takes into account the individual statistical models and weights them according to how good they are at explaining past storm surges. In this way, he sees that the model reflects the known physical relationships, for example, how the El NiÃ±o phenomenon affects the formation of cyclones. The research was performed in collaboration with colleagues from China and England.The statistical models are used to predict the number of hurricane surges 100 years into the future. How much worse will it be per degree of global warming? How many 'Katrinas' will there be per decade?Since 1923, there has been a 'Katrina' magnitude storm surge every 20 years.\"We find that 0.4 degrees Celcius warming of the climate corresponds to a doubling of the frequency of extreme storm surges like the one following Hurricane Katrina. With the global warming we have had during the 20th century, we have already crossed the threshold where more than half of all 'Katrinas' are due to global warming,\" explains Aslak Grinsted.\"If the temperature rises an additional degree, the frequency will increase by 3-4 times and if the global climate becomes two degrees warmer, there will be about 10 times as many extreme storm surges. This means that there will be a 'Katrina' magnitude storm surge every other year,\" says Aslak Grinsted and he points out that in addition to there being more extreme storm surges, the sea will also rise due to global warming. As a result, the storm surges will become worse and potentially more destructive."}

The latest analysis expands on the previously published research that looked at these trends in the three years post-Katrina. The new data show that even five years after the hurricane, heart attacks were still less likely to occur in the mornings or on weekdays and were instead more frequent at night and on the weekends -- a major shift from what cardiologists and hospitals normally see. Researchers point to prolonged periods of stress as the most likely cause.\"The stress and devastation brought on by Katrina doesn't just make a heart attack more likely, but it also can alter when they occur,\" said Matthew Peters, MD, a second year internal medicine resident at Tulane University School of Medicine and the study's lead investigator. \"It may even outweigh or augment some of the physiological mechanisms [behind heart attacks].\"Heart attacks tend to be more common in the morning and on weekdays, especially Mondays, because of surges in the body's stress (cortisol) and \"fight-or-flight\" (catecholamines) hormones, higher than normal blood pressure and heart rate, and a dip in the body's ability to break up blood clots. But the shifts in behaviors and routines seen after the storm may have trumped some of these factors, Dr. Peters said.Still, researchers did find a potentially encouraging sign from this latest analysis -- a slight return of Monday morning heart attacks in a pattern closer to pre-storm events. Before the hurricane, 23 percent of heart attacks occurred on Mondays. This dropped to 10 percent in the three years after the storm and only recently crept up to 16.5 percent, though it is not a statistically significant change.\"It suggests some normalization in employment and work patterns, but generally things still appear to be pretty much in disarray,\" Dr. Peters said.He speculates that with so many people forced out of work after Katrina, weekday mornings and Mondays, in particular, became less stressful. In the last two years, the unemployment rate in New Orleans has dropped slightly -- from 17.9 to 15.2 percent; however, it is still twice the pre-storm unemployment rate of 7 percent. Night and weekend heart attacks may be more likely because day-to-day life at home became more anxiety-ridden with temporary housing, rebuilding homes and financial stressors.Researchers looked at heart attack trends in a total of 1,044 confirmed heart attack cases; 299 before Katrina, 408 in the three years after Katrina and another 337 in the four and five years after the storm.Compared to the pre-Katrina group, morning and weekday heart attacks continued to be a significantly smaller portion of total heart attacks in years four and five after the storm (45.2 vs. 30.5 percent and 60.2 vs. 36.3 percent, respectively). Heart attacks occurring over the weekend were nearly twice as likely as before the storm hit (30.6 vs. 16.1 percent of all heart attacks) and night heart attacks remained significantly elevated as well (43.6 vs. 29.8 percent). Compared to the one to three years after the storm, years four and five showed non-significant decreases in morning, weekday and weekend heart attacks and a substantial (but non-significant) reduction in heart attacks at night.Patients in the post-Katrina group were more likely to be smokers (52.3 vs. 34.4 percent) and lack health insurance (17.1 vs. 8.4 percent) compared to those before the storm. No significant differences were noted between groups in terms of age, sex, ethnicity, medical comorbidities, medications or substance abuse. Excluded from the study were non-New Orleans residents, hospital transfers, patients with symptom onset while hospitalized and patients without adequate documentation of timing of symptom onset.Dr. Peters says this research may affect hospitals and health care workers in areas hard-hit by hurricanes and other natural disasters as they tend to be understaffed at night or on the weekends because, under normal circumstances, fewer patients come in. However, based on these findings, after a disaster the opposite might be true. He says this could affect patient outcomes as well because patients who are treated at night generally have higher failure rates for angioplasty, longer door-to-balloon times and higher rates of in-hospital mortality, he adds.\"With the increased incidence of major disasters in the U.S. and worldwide, it is important to understand how these disasters affect the heart because clearly they do,\" Dr. Peters said.Dr. Peters and his team, led by Anand Irimpen, MD, associate professor of medicine at the Heart and Vascular Institute of Tulane University School of Medicine and chief of cardiology at the Southeast Louisiana Veterans Health Care System, are planning to collaborate with medical centers in other regions hard-hit by hurricanes or other natural disasters to collect more data on these trends."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_326", "content": "The new data -- an update to previous analyses comparing the behavioral and heart health of people before and after the storm -- show this heightened risk persists even though post-Katrina patients are more likely to be prescribed medications known to prevent heart attacks such as aspirin, beta blockers, statins and ACE inhibitors. Compared to the pre-Katrina group, those experiencing a heart attack after the storm were less likely to comply with these therapies or have health insurance. They were also more likely to smoke, overuse alcohol or other substances, and be burdened with high levels of stress and mental illness.\"Overwhelmingly, the main differences in the pre- and post-Katrina populations involve psychosocial risk factors as opposed to shifts in traditional cardiovascular risk factors like hypertension, obesity and diabetes,\" said Anand Irimpen, MD, the study's senior investigator, associate professor of medicine at the Heart and Vascular Institute of Tulane University School of Medicine and chief of cardiology at the Southeast Louisiana Veterans Health Care System. \"These findings have broad implications about how natural disasters affect communities, as well as the extensive costs to society, whether it is financial or social.\"Dr. Irimpen said the evidence supports an association between pervasive levels of chronic stress and heart health and underscores the need for clinicians to proactively assess their patients' anxiety levels, especially in the aftermath of such a traumatic event. Previous studies indicate stress reduction and cognitive behavioral therapy, in particular, may reduce the occurrence of heart attacks.This study evaluated patients admitted with heart attacks to Tulane Medical Center in the two years before Katrina and the six years after the hospital reopened, which was five months after Katrina. Researchers examined differences in the incidence of heart attacks and compared the two groups based on specific demographic and clinical data, including lab test results, health insurance status, first-time hospitalization, medical non-adherence, smoking status, substance abuse and employment. In the post-Katrina group, there were 1,177 confirmed admissions for heart attack representing 2.4 percent of the total patient census of 48,258 compared to 150 admissions representing 0.7 percent of the patient census of 21,079 in the two-year pre-Katrina group (p<0.0001).The groups were comparable in terms of age, sex, ethnicity and hypertension. However, the post-Katrina group had a higher prevalence of prior coronary artery bypass grafts, hyperlipidemia, psychiatric comorbidities like depression and anxiety disorder, as well as smoking and substance abuse. This group was also more likely to be unemployed, uninsured and reside in New Orleans. While there seems to be a higher proportion of people with coronary artery disease post-Katrina, Dr. Irimpen says this increase may be secondary to the surge in heart attacks. The prevalence of known coronary artery disease among these patients was 42, 48 and 53 percent at two, four and six years after the storm, respectively. It was 30.7 percent pre-Katrina, suggesting that people may not be adequately controlling cardiovascular risk factors.\"Large-scale catastrophes like Hurricane Katrina seem to create a very large shift in the population and the way it behaves and takes care of itself,\" he said. \"While there is a lot we can do with medications and medical interventions, those therapies become less effective based on the way the patient takes care of him or herself.\"This stark reality has prompted these researchers to recommend that officials in New Orleans and other areas hard-hit by natural disasters, such as hurricanes, tornados, earthquakes or tsunamis, identify and integrate strategies that consider psychological and cardiovascular health into disaster planning. As much as the Gulf Coast has been rebuilt in the last six years, there are still lingering signs of destruction, which have an ongoing effect on heart health.\"The massive devastation of Hurricane Katrina has broken the infrastructure of New Orleans, and its effects are much more far-reaching than we expected,\" Dr. Irimpen said, adding that ongoing implementation of lifestyle changes to help accommodate for unforeseen circumstances is imperative for maintaining heart health.As more data is amassed, he and his research team plan to collaborate with other centers to collect and compare data from sites around the U.S. that have experienced major natural disasters, including those in the New York area following Hurricane Sandy. The hope is that this research will eventually allow the team to create a risk prediction tool that may lead to better triage of patients who are susceptible to post-disaster heart attacks."}

Greene, Cornell professor of earth and atmospheric sciences and director of Cornell's Ocean Resources and Ecosystems program; Jennifer A. Francis of Rutgers University's Institute of Marine and Coastal Sciences; and Bruce C. Monger, Cornell senior research associate, earth and atmospheric sciences.The researchers assert that the record-breaking sea ice loss from summer 2012, combined with the unusual atmospheric phenomena observed in late October, appear to be linked to global warming.A strong atmospheric, high-pressure blocking pattern over Greenland and the northwest Atlantic prevented Hurricane Sandy from steering northeast and out to sea like most October hurricanes and tropical storms from the Caribbean. In fact, Sandy traveled up the Atlantic coast and turned left \"toward the most populated area along the eastern seaboard\" and converged with an extratropical cyclone; this, in turn, fed the weakening Hurricane Sandy and transformed it into a monster tempest.Superstorm Sandy's extremely low atmospheric pressure and the strong high-pressure block to the north created violent east winds that pushed storm surge against the eastern seaboard. \"To literally top it off, the storm surge combined with full-moon high tides and huge ocean waves to produce record high water levels that exceeded the worst-case predictions for parts of New York City,\" write the researchers.Greene, Francis and Monger add: \"If one accepts this evidence and . . . takes into account the record loss of Arctic sea ice this past September, then perhaps the likelihood of greenhouse warming playing a significant role in Sandy's evolution as an extratropical superstorm is at least as plausible as the idea that this storm was simply a freak of nature.\""}

The ground under the railroad lines has been breached, and the line of erosion has moved dangerously close to the beach road. Additionally, we need to protect underground utilities near the beach road.\"Originally built in the 1960s for the Apollo Saturn V rockets that sent astronauts to the moon, the launch pads were modified in the late 1970s to support the Space Shuttle Program. Pad B is now being updated to support NASA's heavy-lift Space Launch System launch vehicle and Orion capsule. Pad A may be used in the future for commercial rockets.\"The pads are crucial to our future, and we've got to make sure we do all we can to protect them,\" Dankert said.It doesn't take a direct hit from a hurricane to cause severe erosion on the beaches.\"When Sandy moved north past Florida, it was 220 miles offshore, but its effects were far-reaching,\" Dankert said. \"The ocean pounds the beaches with higher tides and strong winds that rip away at the dunes, moving the shoreline farther inland.\"Dankert explained that Sandy was only the most recent blow to beaches along the Space Coast.\"During Kennedy's history, tropical weather has continued to batter our shoreline,\" he said. \"Some pass by, and with some we've had a few direct hits. It's a constant battle to restore the dunes that hold off the weather-induced erosion.\"Experts such as Dankert are busy developing a long-term plan to mitigate the constant battering from the environment. They hope to use some of the $15 million included for NASA in the multi-billion-dollar Hurricane Sandy relief bill passed by Congress.\"Part of these funds will go to the NASA facility on Wallops Island on the coast of Virginia since they had a lot of damage too,\" he said. \"Hopefully, we will be able to use some of that money to rebuild the sand dunes here.\"Kennedy officials are hoping to bring in sand to replace the protective sand dunes on the beach that can serve as a buffer from tropical cyclones.\"A Dune Vulnerability Team was formed in 2009 to assess the condition of our shoreline and develop a strategy to provide long-term protection,\" Dankert said. \"The DVT is a joint effort with NASA, U.S. Geological Survey, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the University of Florida. In addition to rebuilding the dunes, we needed to plant native vegetation on newly created dunes to provide soil stabilization and benefits to native wildlife.\"Following a number of hurricanes and tropical storms dating back to 2004, repairs to the primary dunes along Kennedy's beaches was required. A 15-foot-high, 725-foot long secondary dune was completed in 2010 along the widest expanse between pads A and B. The new dune was the only stretch remaining intact after Hurricane Sandy.\"After rebuilding the dunes, we may remove the rail since it hasn't been used in years,\" Dankert said, \"so we can protect the beach road and the launch pads which are crucial to Kennedy's future.\"The space center's shoreline also is an important habitat for wildlife, including several endangered species. \"Losing portions of the Kennedy shoreline may have negative effects for species such as the Southeastern beach mouse, indigo snakes and gopher tortoises,\" Dankert said. \"Restoring the dunes will also help us protect these species.\"Dankert noted that the re-built dunes also would block launch pad lighting on the beach, thus aiding nesting and hatchling sea turtles find their way to and from the ocean.\"The newly hatched sea turtles are disoriented by artificial light,\" he said. \"We want to encourage them to head toward the sea.\"According to Dankert, the funding to begin restoring the beach dunes comes at a crucial time for the Florida spaceport.\"Our beaches have been slowly eroding for years and the sooner we get started, the better,\" he said. \"This will, at least, get us going.\""}

It is also in the process of attaching it to a remote controlled aircraft for low-altitude data collection. In addition, the engineers will make a system to display the data on an aerial map of the area and algorithm to help emergency responders triage their recovery efforts.\"In addition to the lives lost and destruction caused by Hurricane Sandy, the residual effects are still very much with us,\" said co-researcher Dr. Antonios Kontsos, an assistant professor in the College of Engineering. \"Our goal is to make sure that responders have even more information at their disposal the next time something like this happens so that perhaps some of this loss can be prevented.\""}

{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_331", "content": "Now scientist Jeffrey Chambers and colleagues at the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab) have devised an analytical method that combines satellite images, simulation modeling and painstaking fieldwork to help researchers detect forest mortality patterns and trends. This new tool will enhance understanding of the role of forests in carbon sequestration and the impact of climate change on such disturbances.\"One quarter of COChambers, in close collaboration with Robinson Negron-Juarez at Tulane University, Brazil's National Institute for Amazon Research (Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas da AmazÃ´nia [INPA]) and other colleagues, studied a section of the Central Amazon spanning over a thousand square miles near Manaus, Brazil. By linking data from Landsat satellite images over a 20-year period with observations on the ground, they found that 9.1 to 16.9 percent of tree mortality was missing from more conventional plot-based analyses of forests. That equates to more than half a million dead trees each year that had previously been unaccounted for in studies of this region, and which need to be included in forest carbon budgets.Their findings were published online this week in the \"If these results hold for most tropical forests, then it would indicate that because we missed some of the mortality, then the contribution of these forests to the net sink might be less than previous studies have suggested,\" Chambers said. \"An old-growth forest has a mosaic of patches all doing different things. So if you want to understand the average behavior of that system you need to sample at a much larger spatial scale over larger time intervals than was previously appreciated. You don't see this mosaic if you walk through the forest or study only one patch. You really need to look at the forest at the landscape scale.\"Trees and other living organisms are key players in the global carbon cycle, a complex biogeochemical process in which carbon is exchanged among the atmosphere, the ocean, the biosphere and Earth's crust. Fewer trees mean not only a weakening of the forest's ability to absorb carbon, but the decay of dead trees will also release carbon dioxide back into the atmosphere. Large-scale tree mortality in tropical ecosystems could thus act as a positive feedback mechanism, accelerating the global warming effect.The Amazon forest is hit periodically by fierce thunderstorms that may bring violent winds with concentrated bursts believed to be as high as 170 miles per hour. The storms can blow down many acres of the forest; however, Chambers and his team were able to paint a much more nuanced picture of how storms affected the forest.By looking at satellite images before and after a storm, the scientists discerned changes in the reflectivity of the forest, which they assumed was due to damage to the canopy and thus tree loss. Researchers were then sent into the field at some of the blowdown areas to count the number of trees felled by the storm. Looking at the satellite images pixel by pixel (with each pixel representing 900 square meters, or about one-tenth of a football field) and matching them with on-the-ground observations, they were able to draw a detailed mortality map for the entire landscape, which had never been done before.Essentially they found that tree mortality is clustered in both time and space. \"It's not blowdown or no blowdown -- it's a gradient, with everything in between,\" he said. \"Some areas have 80 percent of trees down, some have 15 percent.\"In one particularly violent storm in 2005, a squall line more than 1,000 miles long and 150 miles wide crossed the entire Amazon basin. The researchers estimated that hundreds of millions of trees were potentially destroyed, equivalent to a significant fraction of the estimated mean annual carbon accumulation for the Amazon forest. This finding was published in 2010 in As climatic warming is expected to bring more intense droughts and stronger storms, understanding their effect on tropical and forest ecosystems becomes ever more important. \"We need to establish a baseline so we can say how these forests functioned before we changed the climate,\" Chambers said.This new tool can be used to assess tree mortality in other types of forests as well. Chambers and colleagues reported in the journal Disturbances such as Superstorm Sandy and Hurricane Katrina cause large impacts to the terrestrial carbon cycle, forest tree mortality and COBesides understanding how forests affect carbon cycling, the new technique could also play a vital role in understanding how climate change will affect forests. Although the atmospheric CO\"But these climate change signals will start popping out of the noise faster and faster as the years go on,\" Chambers said. \"So, what's going to happen to old-growth tropical forests?

At its peak in July, the drought of 2012 engulfed 61 percent of the nation with the Mountain West, Great Plains, and Midwest experiencing the most intense drought conditions. The dry conditions proved ideal for wildfires in the West, charring 9.2 million acres-the third highest on record.The U.S. Climate Extremes Index indicated that 2012 was the second most extreme year on record for the nation. The index, which evaluates extremes in temperature and precipitation, as well as landfalling tropical cyclones, was nearly twice the average value and second only to 1998. To date, 2012 has seen 11 disasters that have reached the $1 billion threshold in losses, to include Sandy, Isaac, and tornado outbreaks experienced in the Great Plains, Texas and Southeast/Ohio Valley.This analysis from NOAA's National Climatic Data Center is part of the suite of climate services NOAA provides government, business and community leaders so they can make informed decisions.Every state in the contiguous U.S. had an above-average annual temperature for 2012. Nineteen states had a record warm year and an additional 26 states had one of their 10 warmest.On the national scale, 2012 started off much warmer than average with the fourth warmest winter (December 2011-February 2012) on record. Winter warmth limited snow with many locations experiencing near-record low snowfall totals. The winter snow cover for the contiguous U.S. was the third smallest on record and snowpack totals across the Central and Southern Rockies were less than half of normal.Spring started off exceptionally warm with the warmest March on record, followed by the fourth warmest April and second warmest May. The season's temperature was 5.2Â°F above average, making it easily the warmest spring on record, surpassing the previous record by 2.0Â°F. The warm spring resulted in an early start to the 2012 growing season in many places, which increased the loss of water from the soil earlier than what is typical. In combination with the lack of winter snow and residual dryness from 2011, the record warm spring laid the foundation for the widespread drought conditions in large areas of the U.S. during 2012.The above-average temperatures of spring continued into summer. The national-scale heat peaked in July with an average temperature of 76.9Â°F, 3.6Â°F above average, making it the hottest month ever observed for the contiguous United States. The eighth warmest June, record hottest July, and a warmer-than-average August resulted in a summer average temperature of 73.8Â°F, the second hottest summer on record by only hundredths of a degree. An estimated 99.1 million people experienced 10 or more days of summer temperatures greater than 100Â°F, nearly one-third of the nation's population.Autumn and December temperatures were warmer than average, but not of the same magnitude as the three previous seasons. Autumn warmth in the western U.S. offset cooler temperatures in the eastern half of the country. Although the last four months of 2012 did not bring the same unusual warmth as the first 8 months of the year, the September through December temperatures were warm enough for 2012 to remain the record warmest year by a wide margin.The nationally-averaged precipitation total of 26.57 inches was 2.57 inches below average and the 15th driest year on record for the lower 48. This was also the driest year for the nation since 1988 when 25.25 inches of precipitation was observed.The driest conditions during 2012 occurred across the central United States. Two states, Nebraska and Wyoming, had their driest years on record. Eight additional states had annual precipitation totals ranking among the bottom ten. Drier-than-average conditions stretched from the Intermountain West, through the Great Plains and Midwest, and into the Southeast. Wetter-than-average conditions occurred in the Pacific Northwest, where Washington had its fifth wettest year on record, as well as parts of the Gulf Coast and Northeast.Each season of 2012 had precipitation totals below the 20th century average:Alaska was cooler and slightly wetter than average during 2012. The year began very cold for the state with a January temperature 14.0Â°F below the 1971-2000 average. Each subsequent season was also cooler than average, resulting in an annual temperature 2.3Â°F below average. Much of 2012 was also wetter than average, and the annual precipitation total was 9.2 percent above average.Drought conditions continued to plague Hawaii during 2012. At the beginning of 2012, 47.4 percent of the state was experiencing moderate-to-exceptional drought, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. By the end of the year, the percent area experiencing moderate-to-exceptional drought expanded to 63.3 percent of the state.Tropical cyclone activity across the North Atlantic in 2012 as above-average with 19 named storms, ten hurricanes, and one major hurricane (Category 3 or stronger). This is the third consecutive North Atlantic tropical cyclone season with 19 named storms and ties with as the third most active season for the basin. Isaac and Sandy made landfall along the U.S. coast during 2012 causing significant impacts. Isaac brought large storm surge and torrential rains to the Gulf Coast. Sandy caused significant damage to the Northeast, with 8 million homes losing power and 131 fatalities reported.The widespread drought conditions of 2012 peaked in July with approximately 61 percent of the country experiencing drought conditions. The footprint of drought during 2012 roughly equaled the drought of the 1950s which peaked at approximately 60 percent. The size of the current drought and the drought of the 1950s are smaller than the drought episodes of the 1930s. The current drought has yet to reach the intensity or duration of the 1950s and 1930s national-scale droughts.Wildfire activity during 2012 was above-average with 9.2 million acres burned -the third most in the 13-year record. Numerous large and destructive wildfires impacted the western U.S. throughout the year. The Waldo Canyon fire near Colorado Springs, Colorado destroyed nearly 350 homes and was the most destructive fire on record for the state. The Whitewater-Baldy Complex fire charred nearly 300,000 acres and was the largest on record for New Mexico.Tornado activity during 2012 was below the 1991-2010 average of approximately 1,200. The year got off to a busy start with large tornado outbreaks in March and April causing significant damage in the Ohio Valley and Central Plains. May and June, typically the most active tornado months of the year, both had less than half of average tornado counts. The final 2012 tornado count will likely be less than 1,000-the least since 2002.More information is available at:"}

For this reason, U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) scientists continue to look for ways to better forecast a wide range of natural hazards and protect our communities.Let's take a closer look at the state of the science -- what we know and what we don't know -- about our ability to forecast natural disasters.Despite claims to the contrary, no reliable short-term earthquake prediction method has ever been developed. Nor do scientists expect to develop a method in the foreseeable future.However, based on scientific data, probabilities can be calculated for future earthquakes. For example, comprehensive assessments of long-term earthquake rates in California tell us there is roughly a 2-in-3 chance that a magnitude 6.7 or larger earthquake will strike in the next 30 years in the greater San Francisco Bay Area. Within the state of California as a whole, earthquakes this large are virtually certain (a 99% probability) in that same time frame.USGS scientists are also working with university colleagues to gather objective and quantitative information on which to base shorter-term earthquake forecasts. This work includes developing better methods to quantify changes in probability based on recent earthquake activity. For example, scientists are looking at the probability for a larger earthquake after an initial earthquake. They are also developing approaches to communicate these probabilities that will be most effective at supporting appropriate decision making.Learn more about USGS earthquake forecasting and hazards research (The United States is home to 169 active volcanoes, many of which could erupt at any time. Fortunately, volcanoes generally show signs of unrest hours, weeks and months before they erupt. Changes in gas emissions, swelling of a volcano, and swarms of small earthquakes are signs that a volcano is awakening. All of these changes can be detected with proper monitoring equipment.The USGS National Volcano Early Warning System (Learn more and see current alerts and status for volcanoes in the United States by visiting the USGS Volcano Hazards website (Landslides occur in all 50 states and pose a significant risk in many areas. Scientists know landslides are likely on the west coast during its rainy season from November to March, during spring and summer thunderstorms in the western mountain states, and during hurricane season along the east coast. People at especially high risk for landslide damage are those living on or below steep hill slopes.Wildfires can lead to flash flooding and debris flow, as vegetation is removed that would have served as a stabilizing factor and the remaining burned soil is less able to absorb rainwater. Landslides can also occur from earthquakes, volcanic activity, changes in groundwater, or disturbance and change of a slope by human-made construction activities.USGS scientists produce maps of areas susceptible to landslides and identify what sort of rainfall conditions will lead to such events. The USGS is working with the National Weather Service on a prototype Debris Flow Warning System (For more information, visit the USGS Landslide Hazards Program website (Wildfires are a great concern when there is a lack of precipitation, particularly during the summer months when the weather becomes hot and dry. When there is no water, wildfires can spread very quickly and can be hard to control. Climate change and the resulting hotter and arid conditions are expected to significantly increase wildfire frequency and severity.The USGS plays an integral role in preparing for and responding to wildfires (Hurricane season runs from June 1 through November, with September as the peak time when they are most likely to strike. But hurricanes and tropical storms can hit at other times as well.NOAA is responsible for monitoring and issuing warnings for hurricanes and tropical storms. The USGS works with NOAA and provides information on associated coastal vulnerability and change (Flooding from storms is another concern, as is drought from lack of rainfall. The USGS conducts real-time monitoring of the nation's rivers and streams, and you can visit USGS WaterWatch (What is a magnetic storm? The sun is always emitting a wind of electrically charged particles that flows outward into space. If these concentrations of solar wind are directed towards Earth, then the magnetic field of Earth in space (the magnetosphere) can be disturbed, sometimes for days.Large magnetic storms can cause loss of radio communication, affect global-positioning systems, damage satellite electronics and cause electrical blackouts. Damaging storms occur about 4 times a decade, with smaller events occurring more frequently. Magnetic storms can be detected up to 2 days in advance by monitoring the sun. They come in all sizes, but the largest storms tend to occur when sunspots (concentrations of magnetic energy on the surface of the sun) are most numerous.The monitoring of \"space weather\" conditions is a responsibility of several U.S. government agencies, including NOAA, NASA, and the U.S. Air Force. The USGS has the unique responsibility of monitoring geomagnetic activity at Earth's surface, close to where most of the effects of magnetic storms are actually realized.

Just before Hurricane Sandy hit the East Coast, that number was around 0.2 percent in the U.S. (pretty good, by global standards) -- but once the storm made landfall, it jumped to 0.43 percent and took about four days to return to normal, according to a new report by scientists at the Information Sciences Institute (ISI) at the USC Viterbi School of Engineering.\"On a national scale, the amount of outage is small, showing how robust the Internet is. However, this significant increase in outages shows the large impact Sandy had on our national infrastructure,\" said John Heidemann, who led the team that tracked an analyzed the data. Heidemann is a research professor of computer science and project leader in the Computer Networks Division of ISI.Heidemann worked with graduate student Lin Quan and research staff member Yuri Pradkin, both also from ISI, sending tiny packets of data known as \"pings\" to networks and waiting for \"echoes,\" or responses. Though some networks -- those with a firewall -- will not respond to pings, this method has been shown to provide a statistically reasonable picture of when parts of the Internet are active or down.The team was also able to pinpoint where the outages were occurring, and noted a spike in outages in New Jersey and New York after Sandy made landfall.Their research was published as a technical report on the ISI webpage on December 17, and the raw data will be made available to other scientists who would like to analyze it.The data is not yet specific enough to say exactly how many individuals were affected by the outage, but does provide solid information about the scale and location of outages, which could inform Internet service providers on how best to allocate resources to respond to natural disasters.\"Our work measures the virtual world to peer into the physical,\" said Heidemann. \"We are working to improve the coverage of our techniques to provide a nearly real-time view of outages across the entire Internet. We hope that our approach can help first responders quickly understand the scope of evolving natural disasters.\""}

Potential damage to gas pipeline pressure regulators, caused by flooding in Hurricane Sandy, has raised ongoing safety concerns in New York and New Jersey.The researchers report finding 3,356 separate natural gas leaks under the streets of Boston. \"While our study was not intended to assess explosion risks, we came across six locations in Boston where gas concentrations exceeded the threshold above which explosions can occur,\" said Nathan Phillips, associate professor in BU's Department of Earth and Environment and co-author of the study.Nationally, natural gas pipeline failures cause an average of 17 fatalities, 68 injuries, and $133M in property damage annually, according to the U.S. Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration. In addition to the explosion hazard, natural gas also poses a major environmental threat: Methane, the primary ingredient of natural gas, is a powerful greenhouse gas that degrades air quality. Leaks in the United States contribute to $3 billion of lost and unaccounted for natural gas each year.\"Repairing these leaks will improve air quality, increase consumer health and safety, and save money,\" said co-author Robert B. Jackson, Nicholas Professor of Global Environmental Change at Duke. \"We just have to put the right financial incentives into place.\"Phillips and Jackson's teams collaborated with industry partners Robert Ackley of Gas Safety, Inc., and Eric Crosson of Picarro, Inc., on the study. They mapped the gas leaks under Boston using a new, high-precision methane analyzer installed in a GPS-equipped car. Driving all 785 road miles within city limits, the researchers discovered 3,356 leaks.The leaks were distributed evenly across neighborhoods and were associated with old cast-iron underground pipes, rather than neighborhood socioeconomic indicators. Levels of methane in the surface air on Boston's streets exceeded fifteen times the normal atmospheric background value.Like Boston, other cities with aging pipeline infrastructure may be prone to leaks. The researchers recommend coordinated gas-leaks mapping campaigns in cities where the infrastructure is deemed to be at risk. The researchers will continue to quantify the health, safety, environmental, and economic impacts of the leaks, which will be made available to policymakers and utilities as they work to replace and repair leaking natural gas pipeline infrastructure.Lucy Hutyra, Assistant Professor and Max Brondfield, technician, worked with Phillips on this study at Boston University.

It is likely that the weather forecast would have featured frequent hurricane-force storms in New York and other eastern states, and warmer, more tropical weather from Seattle to California.\"Since Polar Regions existed 450 million years ago, the scientists believe that there would have been similar climate belts to those of today.The research team from Durham University and universities in Canada, Denmark and the USA, discovered a belt of undisturbed fossils and sediments -deposits of shellfish- more than 6000 km long stretching from the south-western United States to North Greenland. The belt also lacks typical storm-related sedimentary features where the deposits are disturbed by bad weather. The researchers say that this shows that the Late Ordovician equatorial zone, like the equatorial zone today, had few hurricane-grade storms.In contrast, sedimentary deposits recorded on either side of the belt provide evidence of disturbance by severe storms. Hurricanes tend to form in the areas immediately outside of equatorial zones where temperatures of at least 26The position of the equatorial belt, defined by undisturbed fossil accumulations and sediments, is coincident with the Late Ordovician equator interpreted from magnetic records (taken from rocks of a similar age from the region). This provides both a precise equatorial location and confirms that Earth's magnetic field operated much in the same way as it does today.The scientists pieced together the giant jigsaw map using the evidence of the disturbed and undisturbed sedimentary belts together with burrows and shells. Using the findings from these multiple sites, they were able to see that North America sat on either side of the Equator.Co-author Christian Rasmussen, University of Copenhagen, said: \"The layers of the earth build up over time and are commonly exposed by plate tectonics. We are able to use these ancient rocks and their fossils as evidence of the past to create an accurate map of the Ordovician globe.\"Professor Harper added: \"The findings show that we had the same climate belts of today and we can see where North America was located 450 million years ago, essentially on the Equator.\"\"While the Equator has remained in approximately the same place over time, the landmasses have shifted dramatically over time through tectonic movements. The undisturbed fossil belt helps to locate the exact position of the ancient Laurentian landmass, now known as North America.\"The study is funded by the Danish Council for Independent Research."}

Headquartered at UD, the organization aggregates ocean data collected along the Atlantic coast from Massachusetts to North Carolina to share with researchers, government officials and the public.As the storm headed up the coast, the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) contacted MARACOOS for information. Xiao-Hai Yan, Mary A. S. Lighthipe Professor of Oceanography and director of the Center for Remote Sensing, worked to install the satellite dish at UD to provide real-time coverage of regional disaster events.\"We at UD provide satellite support for MARACOOS,\" Yan said. \"So that is why we have our images focused on that area right now.\"According to NJDEP, Hurricane Sandy damage took several wastewater treatment facilities offline, causing untreated sewage into certain waterways. Recreational boaters, anglers and crabbers were advised on Friday, Nov. 2, to avoid those waterways and not eat any fish, crustaceans or shellfish from these waters due to contamination from bacteria and viruses. Additional advisories were issued on Nov. 5 and Nov. 6.Affected waterways are located in northern New Jersey and include the Hudson River, Passaic River, Hackensack River, Newark Bay, Kill Van Kull and Arthur Kill, Raritan Bay, Raritan River, Sandy Hook Bay and northern Barnegat Bay."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_340", "content": "As its name suggests, the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellite was designed to measure how much moisture is held in soil and how much salt is held in the surface waters of the oceans.This information is helping to improve our understanding of the water cycle -- an essential component of the Earth system.However, this state-of-the-art Earth Explorer mission has demonstrated that its instrumentation and measuring techniques can be used to offer much more.Since SMOS has the ability to see through clouds and it is little affected by rain, it can also provide reliable estimates of the surface wind speeds under intense storms.Parts of the Caribbean and northeastern US are still suffering the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, which is the largest Atlantic hurricane on record.Unusually, Sandy was a hybrid storm, tapping energy from the evaporation of seawater like a hurricane and from different air temperatures like a winter storm. These conditions generated a super storm that spanned an incredible 1800 km.As it orbited above, the satellite intercepted parts of Hurricane Sandy at least eight times as the storm swept over Jamaica and Cuba around 25 October, until its landfall in New Jersey, US, four days later.The data from these encounters have been used to estimate the speed of the wind over the ocean's surface.SMOS carries a novel microwave sensor to capture images of 'brightness temperature'. These images correspond to radiation emitted from the surface of Earth, which are then used to derive information on soil moisture and ocean salinity.Strong winds over oceans whip up waves and whitecaps, which in turn affect the microwave radiation being emitted from the surface. This means that although strong storms make it difficult to measure salinity, the changes in emitted radiation can, however, be linked directly to the strength of the wind over the sea.This method of measuring surface wind speeds was developed by scientists at the French Research Institute for Exploration of the Sea and Collect Localisation Satellites, CLS, within ESA's Earth Observation Support to Science Element programme.The method was originally used during Hurricane Igor in 2010, but has again proven accurate. During Hurricane Sandy, SMOS data compare well with realtime measurements from meteorological buoys as the super storm passed between the coast of the US and the Bermuda Islands.Moreover, NOAA's Hurricane Research Division flew a P-3 aircraft seven times into Hurricane Sandy to gather measurements of surface wind speeds, rain and other meteorological parameters. One of these airborne campaigns coincided with an overpass of the satellite.Keeping in mind the significantly differing sampling characteristics between the SMOS radiometer and the aircraft sensor, there was excellent agreement in the measurements. Both instruments consistently detected a wind band 150 km south of the hurricane eye, with a speed of just over 100 km/h.Being able to measure ocean surface wind in stormy conditions with the synoptic and frequent coverage of SMOS is paramount for tracking and forecasting hurricane strength.Although ESA's Earth Explorers are developed to address specific scientific issues, they continue to demonstrate their versatility."}

The effect can be especially troubling on children and adolescents who don't have the same ability as adults to anticipate and cope with trauma.\"According to Dr. Deblinger, some children who experienced Hurricane Sandy's destruction will exhibit symptoms -- such as withdrawal, depression, sleeplessness and unusually aggressive behavior -- that are commonly associated with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Without help, there is a risk that these symptoms could last a lifetime.Dr. Deblinger suggests that parents and caregivers help children cope with the stress and anxiety resulting from Hurricane Sandy by:â¢ Returning to normal routines, if possible, and engaging in rituals such as bedtime stories and family meals that that are comforting for children. â¢ Minimizing the viewing of television coverage about the storm as the news can provoke anxiety in young people. â¢ Encouraging optimism about managing the aftermath of the storm and preparing for the future. â¢ Remembering that, because they are their children's most important role models, it is important for parents and caregivers to take care of themselves and engage in healthy coping strategies. â¢ Reaching out for professional help if the trauma stress symptoms exhibited by their children do not subside over time on their own.\"While most children are resilient and will bounce back from the experience, others are going to need help to recover and feel safe again,\" Dr. Deblinger says. \"In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, we saw that the children who were most vulnerable to developing anxiety, and even PTSD or depression, had either experienced other significant trauma or emotional difficulties in their past, or had parents who were having difficulty coping with the effects of the storm.\"Dr. Deblinger says her recommendation that parents and guardians seek professional help for children whose symptoms do not subside is especially important. \"Decades of research have shown that some children, particularly those who have experienced multiple trauma(s), don't eventually 'get over' or 'outgrow' their experiences,\" she notes. \"Left to recover on their own, some children and adolescents may turn to alcohol, drugs and/or other ineffective ways of coping with the distressing feelings and debilitating symptoms associated with PTSD.\"In 2005, Dr. Deblinger made several trips to the Gulf region to help children recover from the effects of Hurricane Katrina and to train other therapists in the use of Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT), a treatment model that she developed with Drs. Judith Cohen and Anthony Mannarino.

The children were evaluated for PTSD symptoms 24 and 30 months after Katrina. The researchers also evaluated the children's PTSD symptoms and amount of disaster-related TV viewing one month after Hurricane Gustav, which made landfall on August 31, 2008.To assess perceptions of self-harm, the researchers asked the children whether they thought they would get hurt during Hurricane Gustav. To measure their overall distress, they asked the children how scared they were during the hurricane. The data were collected as part of the school's counseling curriculum, and the children completed all of the measures in a group classroom setting with the assistance of trained staff.About 25% of the children said they had watched \"a lot\" of disaster coverage on TV, while 31% said they had watched \"a whole lot.\" The amount of Gustav-related coverage that the children watched was associated with their PTSD symptoms post-Gustav. Subsequent analyses revealed that pre-Gusatv symptoms, perceptions of self-harm, and viewing of disaster-related coverage were all predictors of symptoms of PTSD following Hurricane Gustav. But, as the researchers predicted, the relationship between TV viewing and post-Gustav symptoms depended on children's pre-Gustav symptoms. The relationship between TV viewing and post-Gustav symptoms of PTSD was significant only for children who had high levels of pre-Gustav symptoms.The study is one of the first to use a prospective design to examine the relationship between TV viewing and children's stress reactions after disasters, allowing the researchers to investigate the role of possible factors that might contribute to children's symptoms both before and after a natural disaster.Based on their findings, Weems and his colleagues believe that preexisting symptoms could be an important tool for identifying which children are most likely to be negatively affected by watching disaster-related coverage.\"Practitioners with young patients who have anxiety disorders such as PTSD may wish to emphasized to parents the potential effects of media,\" the researchers conclude."}

{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_345", "content": "Seth Stein, a Northwestern University geologist, has teamed up with his father, Jerome Stein, an economist at Brown University, to develop new strategies to defend society against natural disasters like Hurricane Sandy as well as the effects of climate change.The approach, which considers costs and benefits while looking for the best solution, is based on a mathematical technique called optimization.The research is published in the October issue of the Geological Society of America journal \"We're playing a high-stakes game against nature and often losing,\" said Seth Stein, the William Deering Professor of Geological Sciences in the Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences at Northwestern.\"Just in the past few years, both the Japanese tsunami and Hurricane Katrina did more than $100 billion in damage, despite expensive protection measures that were in place. Hurricane Sandy is likely to cost at least $20 billion,\" he said. \"The question is how to do better. For example, should New York spend billions of dollars on a barrier to prevent flooding like the city saw this week?\"Both the U.S. and Japanese governments decided to rebuild the defenses that failed essentially to the level they were before, only better. These decisions have been questioned, Seth Stein said. Critics argue that coastal defenses in Louisiana and surroundings should be built not just to withstand a hurricane like Katrina, but much more powerful ones that are known to occur there.The New York Times noted in discussing Japan's decision to rebuild the tsunami defenses: \"Some critics have long argued that the construction of seawalls was a mistaken, hubristic effort to control nature as well as the kind of wasteful public works project that successive Japanese governments used to reward politically connected companies in flush times and to try to kick-start a stagnant economy.\"The problem, explained Jerome Stein, is that the decisions on how to protect against these hazards are made politically without careful consideration of alternatives. \"There are complicated choices that have to be made, given that we don't know when a similar event will happen,\" he said. \"We need ways to consider a range of options, each of which has different costs and benefits, and help communities involved make the most informed choices.\"The mathematical model the Steins have developed lets communities balance the costs and benefits of different strategies.\"We start from the losses that would occur if nothing was done to protect against future disasters and then calculate how much less they would be for increasing amounts of protection,\" said Jerome Stein, a professor emeritus of economics.\"That reduction is the benefit of more protection, but the increased protection also costs more,\" he said. \"When you add the cost and benefit, you get a U-shaped curve with a minimum at the level of protection that is the best choice. More protection reduces losses, but the cost involved is more than that reduction. Less protection costs less, but produces higher losses. The bottom of the curve is the sweet spot.\"Although global warming results largely from human actions, many of its effects are expected to appear as natural disasters like coastal flooding, severe weather or droughts. The Steins' mathematical optimization model could be applied to these situations, too.\"Nations around the world have to decide both how to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide that cause warming and how to adapt to the effects of warming,\" Seth Stein said. \"Choosing policies to address these large-scale problems is a much more complicated version of addressing a specific hazard in a limited area, so considering costs and benefits and looking for good solutions is even more crucial.\""}

We don't realize how much we depend on the things we consider solid and foundational,\" said Dr. Roca. \"We lose our foundation, sometimes literally. Totally capable individuals under other circumstances don't know what to do,\" added Roca.Stress can manifest itself in feelings of listlessness, helplessness or indecisiveness, or as fear and anxiety, or with changes in sleep or appetite. \"People tend to retreat to their houses, when the way out of the chaos and stress is exactly the opposite,\" said Dr. Roca, a New Orleans native who helped individuals cope with Hurricane Katrina stress before he relocated to Connecticut.To keep yourself strong and positive as much as possible when facing the adversity of natural disaster and upheaval, Dr. Roca suggests:1. Pay attention to nutrition, and eat a diet high in protein. Stay away from sweets and carbohydrates, especially simple carbs from white flour. You need protein to make neurotransmitters, the chemicals that help give you a sense of resilience. 2. Focus on exercise, even if it's just taking a walk as a family. Keep moving. Exercise helps to reduce depression. So does sunlight. 3. Seek other people. Talk to neighbors. Visit friends and family. Ask for help if you need it. 4. Re-prioritize. The things you need will come with time. The things you want will have to wait. 5. Find ways to relax. Gentle music, meditation, deep breathing or quiet time reading can provide a well-needed break. 6. Allow for your time to be flexible. Under the circumstances, you just can't be in a hurry. You have to let go of perfection. You do the best that you can do.With clocks going back the weekend after Hurricane Sandy, days will be shorter. Even one less hour of sunlight each day can trigger feelings of depression in susceptible people. This can make a stressful situation worse. If you have electricity in your home or office, use full spectrum lighting. With a physician's guidance, make sure you are getting enough Vitamin D, which means 2,000 IU for many adults. Other nutritional considerations may include SAMe and St. John's Wort, but be aware that interactions with other medications may occur if taken without proper medical supervision.\"The focus should be on maintaining nutrition, maintaining exercise, paying attention to the effect of light and the interaction with others, and then using some targeted supplements, remembering that during times of great stress nobody gets extra points for perfection,\" said Dr. Roca."}

The snowpack is a reservoir, storing water that will be used throughout the year across the state.\"But if you warm the climate,\" he said, \"those storms become rain events -- there's more immediate runoff, less water storage, and the rain will actually melt some of the existing snowpack.\"The worst-case winter scenario would be a series of storms that cause flooding, said James Brotherton, warning-coordination meteorologist for the National Weather Service in Hanford.\"We definitely have the potential to be impacted by major winter storms, or a series of them,\" Brotherton said.\"It's not uncommon during the winter, at least once, that we will see storms coming off the Pacific and drop more than 100 inches of snow in the mountains over short durations,\" said project scientist and lecturer Robert Rice, with SNRI. \"That could translate into 10 inches of precipitable water -- numbers similar to what they're measuring in Hurricane Sandy. Snow events, which we commonly see in the Sierra, and across the western U.S., are generally unheard of on the East Coast, even during Hurricane Sandy, or a Nor'easter.\"There have been years when what's commonly called The Pineapple Express -- a persistent, strong flow of atmospheric moisture coming from the area near Hawaii -- has pummeled the West Coast. Those kinds of \"atmospheric rivers\" historically caused problems in California, flooding Sacramento and the Central Valley. But land use has changed dramatically from the last time that was a problem -- in the 1800s -- and California has much more control of its waterways, Brotherton said.\"We have very large storms that cross into California and affect our region -- not with the same widespread damage as Hurricane Sandy, but with water and wind that are comparable to hurricanes and tornados,\" Rice said.Rice cited a storm over the last weekend of November 2011 that included a wind event similar to a Category 3 tornado or Category 4 hurricane, with sustained winds higher than 100 mph and gusts of more than 150 mph.\"These storms would be very destructive and costly to urban areas,\" Rice said, \"and they are more frequent than most people imagine. Not much attention is focused on them because they rarely affect large urban populations, more often being restricted to the Sierra.\"While scientists say it's impossible to attribute a single storm to climate change, the overall weather patterns across the U.S. are changing as the oceans warm.UC Merced researchers have repeatedly pointed out that California is likely to experience an increase in wildfires because of warmer temperatures.Because the state depends on snowpack in the mountains for its year-round water supply -- and if the state sees less snow and more rain, as Bales has written -- it's going to be even more critical that the state be able to accurately understand what its available water resources are each year.Bales, Rice and UC Merced and UC Berkeley colleagues have designed a low-cost senor system that could be used as to monitor water and snowpack statewide.They advocate for a unified system that would help maintain control of water resources more efficiently, and give users a clearer, real-time picture of the state's water resources.This year, forecasters aren't sure what the winter will look like because a weak El NiÃ±o climate pattern is in place across the southern Pacific this year.\"A strong El NiÃ±o means Northern California and the Pacific Northwest have a greater chance of below-normal precipitation, Southern California and the Southwest have a greater chance of above-average precipitation, and the center of the state has equal chances of either,\" Bales said. \"But with a weak El NiÃ±o or neutral condition, either above or below normal conditions could prevail across the state.\""}

MPA rainfall totals over the eastern United States were calculated for the period from October 24-31, 2012 when super storm Sandy was making it's catastrophic transit through the area.The rainfall analysis indicated that the heaviest rainfall totals of greater than 260mm (10.2 inches) were over the open waters of the Atlantic Ocean. Rainfall totals of over 180mm (~ 7 inches) occurred over land in many areas near the Atlantic coast from New Jersey to South Carolina.The reported death toll from hurricane Sandy's flooding and high winds has now reached above 120. Over 70 deaths were caused by Sandy in the Caribbean and recent reports bring the total to greater than 50 in the United States.NOAA's Hydrometeorological Prediction Center issued their last advisory on Sandy's remnants on Oct. 31, stating that \"multiple centers of circulation in association with the remnants of Sandy can be found across the lower Great Lakes.\"A visible image from NOAA's GOES-13 satellite at 1:31 p.m. EDT on Nov. 1, 2012 showed the remnant clouds from Sandy still lingered over the Great Lakes and stretched east to New England and north into Canada.The book on this super storm is now closed, though the clean-up will continue for a long time to come."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_349", "content": "Their predictions were accurate overall, when compared with figures released by the federal government on actual outages.The researchers' initial outage estimate, released on Saturday, Oct. 27, was that approximately 10 million people could be without power due to Sandy. The final estimate, released on Monday, Oct. 30, was for 8 to 10 million people to lose power. The team has now conducted a preliminary comparison with outage totals reported by the Department of Energy Situation Report for Wednesday, Oct. 31, at 3 p.m. EDT. The DOE-reported peak outage total was approximately 8.5 million customers. The predicted fraction of people without power was within 8 percent of the DOE-reported percentage of customers without power for the states of New York, Rhode Island, Virginia, Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania. The model predicted that a higher percentage of customers would be out in Maryland and Delaware than were actually without power, likely due to lower-than-expected wind speeds in these areas. The model predicted a lower percentage of customers out than were actually out in both Connecticut and New Jersey.Guikema (pronounced Guy-keh-ma) and his team have developed a computer model built on outage data from 11 hurricanes to estimate the fraction of customers who will lose power, based on expected gust wind speed, expected duration of strong winds greater than 20 meters per second, and population density. Guikema's model may help power companies allocate resources by predicting how many people will be without power and where the most outages will take place, and it provides information that emergency managers can use to better prepare for storms. Guikema, an assistant professor in the Department of Geography and Environmental Engineering at the Johns Hopkins Whiting School of Engineering, says the goal is to restore power faster and save customers money."}

It begins when Tropical Depression 18 strengthened into Hurricane Sandy on Oct. 23, 2012. The animation shows Hurricane Sandy blowing from the Caribbean to the mid-Atlantic where it became wedged between a stationary cold front over the Appalachians and a static high pressure air mass over maritime Canada. The air masses blocked the storm from moving north or east, as it would normally. Instead, their wintery dynamics amplified Sandy and drove it ashore in the mid-Atlantic.Sandy then became a ferocious Nor'easter that brought record storm surges to coastal N.J. and N.Y., plus blizzard conditions to the mountains. Unprecedented chaos occurred in lower New York City, such as flooding the subway system on the evening of Oct. 29. Total damage by the storm was estimated at $20 billion dollars.NOAA's National Hydrometeorological Prediction Center (NOAA/HPC) issued an advisory at 5 a.m. EDT on Oct. 31 that stated there was \"no discernible surface circulation.\" Sandy had weakened to a surface trough (elongated area) of low pressure over western Pennsylvania.There are a lot of warnings and watches in effect as Sandy continues to wind down.

Sandy covered 1.8 million square miles, from the Mid-Atlantic to the Ohio Valley, into Canada and New England. Sandy made landfall hours after the MODIS image was taken.On Oct. 29, 2012 at 11 p.m. EDT, the center of Hurricane Sandy was just 10 miles (15 km) southwest of Philadelphia, Penn., near 39.8 North and 75.4 West. Sandy was still a hurricane with maximum sustained winds near 75 mph (120 kph) and moving northwest at 18 mph (30 kph). Sandy's minimum central pressure had risen to 952 millibars. The hurricane-force-winds extended 90 miles (150 km) east of the center of circulation. Tropical-storm-force winds, however, went much further, as far as 485 miles (780 km).NASA's GOES Project created a \"full-disk view\" of NOAA's GOES satellite data, that captured a global view of Hurricane Sandy's birth to landfall. The animation of NOAA's GOES-13 and GOES-15 satellite observations were combined from Oct. 21-30, 2012 and showed the birth of Tropical Storm Sandy in the Caribbean Sea, the intensification and movement of Sandy in the Atlantic Ocean along the U.S. East Coast, and Hurricane Sandy make landfall in N.J. on Oct. 29 and move inland to Penn.At 2 a.m. EDT, on Oct. 29, Sandy's center was located just south of Lancaster, Penn. At 5 a.m. EDT, Sandy continued moving to the west-northwest at 15 knots (24 kph) and was located just 15 miles (24 km) east of York, Penn., and 90 miles (145 km) west of Philadelphia. Sandy was centered near 40.5 North and 77.0 West. Sandy's minimum central pressure continues to rise and was 960 millibars.Sandy's sustained winds were near 65 mph. Tropical-storm-force winds extend almost 1,000 miles. According to Weather Channel, the winds are going to continue being a problem from the northeast into the Ohio Valley today. The strongest winds are being experienced now in the Great Lakes Region.Hurricane Sandy has caused significant damage in New York City and along the Mid-Atlantic coast. Flooding has been reported from Maine to Va. During the morning hours on Oct. 29 (Eastern Daylight Time), nearly eight million people were without power this morning up and down the East coast. The Appalachian Mtns. received some heavy snow from western Md. down to Tenn. and N.C. As much as 26 inches of snow had fallen in Garrett County, Md. by the morning of Oct. 30. According to Reuters news, flooding along the U.S. East Coast was extensive.According to the NOAA's Hydrometeorological Prediction Center (NOAA/HPC), there are high-wind warnings in effect including gale force winds over the coastal waters of the Mid-Atlantic States, New York and New England. Storm warnings are in effect for portions of the Mid-Atlantic coastal waters. Flood and flash flood watches and warnings are in effect over portions of the Mid-Atlantic and northeastern states.NOAA's HPC forecast on Oct. 29 calls for Sandy to move in a \"west-northwest motion with reduced forward speed is expected today into western Penn. with a turn north into western New York tonight, Oct. 30. The cyclone will move into Canada on Wed., Oct. 31. Steady weakening is forecast during the next 48 hours.\"NOAA/HPC warns that gale-force winds will continue over parts of the Mid-Atlantic through New England on Oct. 29 and storm surge and tides can still cause normally dry areas along or near the coast to be flooded, especially during high tide.NOAA/HPC forecasts large rainfall totals for many areas in Sandy's reach.

Cumulative means the total count of anyone who has lost power, versus peak, which is the number of people without power at any one point in time. For instance, in Maryland, the local utility company reported approximately 290,000 cumulative power outages as of 10:30 a.m. on Monday, Oct. 29, but their peak was approximately 210,000 because they were actively restoring outages while new outages were occurring.Guikema has been tracking Hurricane Sandy since late last week using his computer model, which in the early days of the storm used outage data from 11 hurricanes to estimate the fraction of customers who will lose power, based on expected gust wind speed, expected duration of strong winds greater than 20 meters per second, and population density.

He added that, overall, an estimated $60 billion economic loss could occur when considering lost work time, lost tax revenue on wages, a loss of spending effect and loss of commerce during business closures.\"When you consider how many people we are talking about in New York City alone, the impacts are huge. The economies of these heavily populated areas will essentially come to a grinding halt while we wait for the storm to pass,\" Highfield said. He added that while devastating storms come with an immediate negative shock, investors tend to rebuild vigorously with increased investing in a damaged area during recovery.\"After Sandy passes through, there will be opportunity for the construction industry and additional private spending. There will be initial devastation, but people will end up coming back, and reinvesting.\"In the short run, it can be very painful. In the long run, it may be somewhat of an economic shot, but it will take several, several months. In the meantime, there is a lot of agony and sadness from a human point of view.\"Highfield noted that losses could be harder felt from Sandy simply because the storm is targeting an area that most often sees hurricanes as a television event as they hit the Gulf Coast. This time, a lack of storm experience may amplify the impact, he observed.Associate professor of economics and director of Mississippi State's international business program Jon Rezek said he expects the storm will have a lower impact on the country's oil and gas prices than other hurricanes which have tracked through the Gulf Coast. Sandy's path has not impacted the nation's refineries along the Gulf, and so there has been no supply interruption, he said.\"For the most part, gasoline will flow from a lot of the refineries down here to the rest of the country, with fairly minimal impact in terms of a price increase,\" Rezek said. He added the total number of refineries operating along the east coast is eight, compared to 54 in the Gulf region.\"In total, these facilities in the Northeast refine only about 6 percent of the country's crude oil,\" Rezek said. \"Given the relative lack of refining capacity in the Northeast, a supply disruption there over the next few days will not likely cause near the disruption that Gulf storms have on national or regional gasoline prices.\""}

Most poultry operations, however, should have back-up generators,\" Beck said. \"Producers also are trying to make sure they have enough feed on hand to outlast the effects of the storm, in case hauling becomes an issue.\"Beck said poultry farmers also may have sped up production to decrease birds in houses and provide more product in stores for consumers who need to increase their food supplies in the storm's wake.\"Having product on the shelves could affect pricing due to increased demand, and if the trucking industry is unable to make deliveries, there could be difficulties with supply,\" she said.Transportation also becomes an issue if and when fuel deliveries to farmers are impacted. Tob Tabler, MSU Extension poultry specialist and professor, \"If generators run out of fuel, then providing feed and water to flocks becomes a major issue. If there are power outages and no fuel for generators, environmental conditions -- temperature, ventilation, lighting -- are a big concern,\" said.The milder temperatures of fall see farmers with lower fuel and electricity inputs, and this can mean better bird performance for the season.Beck said, \"Temperatures are not severe right now, so under normal circumstances fall is a good time to raise poultry. Very young birds tolerate heat better and older ones tolerate cold better, for short periods of time.\"While final numbers on any losses to the poultry industry could be weeks away, MSU agricultural economists who have witnessed the impact of hurricanes on the Magnolia State say the storm's impact on food pricing shouldn't be felt in the long term in the urban region where Sandy came ashore.John Michael Riley, an MSU Extension specialist and professor, said he sees this storm's aftermath having \"short term shock\" on New Englanders.\"Since these are not big agriculture production states such as Missouri or Kentucky, I see this as a short term consumption concern mainly involving restaurants and grocery stores,\" he said.Keith Coble, MSU Giles Distinguished Professor in Agricultural Economics, agreed. \"There will definitely be short term disruptions, potential for price gouging, and more. But, I do predict things will get re-established very quickly,\" he said."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_357", "content": "To understand the structure, extent and behavior of Sandy, NASA's CloudSat passed over Sandy at 1832 UTC (10:32 a.m. EDT) on Saturday, Oct. 27, 2012, when the storm was about 335.5 miles (540 km) southeast of Charleston, S.C. CloudSat data was used to create a profile image of Hurricane Sandy by Shigeru Suzuki at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif.At the time of the image Sandy's maximum sustained winds were near 75 mph and Sandy had a minimum pressure of 961 millibars making the storm a Category 1 hurricane. Hurricane Sandy was moving slowly to the northeast at 11 mph almost parallel to the southeast United States coast and directly traversing the Gulf Stream.CloudSat passed over Sandy just west of the hurricane's inner core. Light to moderate precipitation associated with parts of the outer bands of Hurricane Sandy were moving on shore into parts of North Carolina where CloudSat intersected the system. CloudSat showed heavier showers and thunderstorms further south and east of the Atlantic coastline over the open water.\"The CloudSat signal tends to attenuate or dampen in these areas of heavier convection when rain drops become larger than 3 mm (0.11 inch) in diameter,\" said Natalie Tourville, a researcher who works with CloudSat data at the Cooperative Institute for Research in the Atmosphere at Colorado State University, Fort Collins, Colo. \"The cloud shield associated with Hurricane Sandy extended well over 1,000 km from the storm center covering parts of eastern Kentucky and Tennessee and Virginia and West Virginia with mid and high level cloudiness areas of cirrus and altocumulus,\" she said.On Oct. 29 at 1 a.m. EDT the National Hurricane Center (NHC) noted that the center of Hurricane Sandy was located near latitude 37.5 north and longitude 71.5 west. This was about 260 miles (415 km) south-southeast of New York City, and 205 miles (330 km) southeast of Atlantic City, N.J. Sandy was moving north-northwest at 18 mph. Maximum sustained winds have increased to 90 mph (140 kph).According to the National Hurricane Center, hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 175 miles (280 km) from the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 485 miles (780 km). Sustained tropical-storm-force winds are occurring along the coasts of southern New Jersey, Delaware, and eastern Virginia, and extend as far inland as the central and southern Chesapeake Bay.The minimum central pressure estimated from hurricane hunter Aircraft data is 943 millibars, which dropped from 946 millibars at 8 a.m. EDT. A drop in atmospheric pressure indicates intensification.NHC noted that surge-related flooding depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle and can vary greatly over short distances. Because of Sandy's large wind field, elevated water levels could span multiple tide cycles resulting in repeated and extended periods of coastal and bayside flooding. Dangerous surf conditions will continue from Florida through New England for the next couple of days.NOAA's GOES-13 satellite captured a visible image of Hurricane Sandy battering the U.S. East coast on Monday, Oct. 29 at 9:10 a.m. EDT that showed the immense extent of the storm. The image was created by the NASA GOES Project at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Md. Tropical Storm force winds extend almost 500 miles from the center making it almost 1,000 miles in diameter.Other watches and warnings for gale, storm and high winds are in force to the north of the tropical storm warning area and issued by the National Weather Service. Hurricane local statements have also been issued for those areas under tropical storm warning.Infrared satellite imagery provides temperature data to forecasters that identify the cloud heights and strength of different parts of a storm. Basically, the higher the cloud top is, the colder the temperature, and the stronger the storm. Strongest storms have the potential for the heaviest rainfall rates.To measure those cloud top temperatures, NASA uses the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) instrument aboard NASA's Aqua satellite. The AIRS instrument captured infrared imagery of Hurricane Sandy on Monday, Oct. 29 at 0711 UTC (3:11 a.m. EDT) that showed some strong thunderstorms and the extent of Sandy's reach from the Carolinas into the Ohio Valley and eastern Canada. The thunderstorms in the purple areas were reaching high into the troposphere where cloud top temperatures are as cold as -63 Fahrenheit (-52 Celsius).At 11 a.m. EDT on Oct. 29, the National Hurricane Center said that Hurricane-force winds are expected along the U.S. East Coast between Chincoteague, Va.and Chatham, Mass. This Includes the Tidal Potomac from Cobb Island to Smith Point, the middle and upper Chesapeake Bay, Delaware Bay and the coasts of the northern Delmarva Peninsula, New Jersey, the New York City area, Long Island, Connecticut and Rhode Island.Tropical-storm-force winds are expected north of Chatham to Merrimack River Mass., the lower Chesapeake Bay and south of Chincoteague, Va. to Duck, N.C., the northern endpoint of the Tropical Storm Warning.Hurricane Sandy is expected to bring heavy rainfall to the Mid-Atlantic and northeastern U.S., and snowfall to the mountain areas.The National Hurricane Center bulletin on Oct. 29 at 8 a.m. EDT, noted that rainfall totals of 3 to 6 inches are expected over far northeastern N.C. with isolated maximum totals of 8 inches possible. Rainfall amounts of 4 to 8 inches are expected over portions of the Mid-Atlantic States, including the Delmarva Peninsula with isolated maximum amounts of 12 inches possible. Rainfall amounts of 1 to 3 inches with isolated maximum amounts of 5 inches are possible from the southern tier of New York state northeastward through New England.Snowfall is another expectation from Sandy as Arctic air sits to the west. Blizzard warnings are posted from western Maryland to southwestern Virginia today. Snow accumulations of 2 to 3 feet are expected in the mountains of W.Va. with locally higher totals today through Wed., Oct. 31. Between 1to 2 feet of snow is expected in the mountains of southwestern Va. to the Ky. Border with 12 to 18 inches of snow in the mountains near the N.C. and Tenn. border and in the mountains of Western Md."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_358", "content": "At 2:20 p.m. EDT on Sunday, Oct. 28, Hurricane Sandy was a marginal category 1 hurricane and its eyewall is modest, as TRMM reveals, which gives forecasters and scientists hints about its possible future strength.The eyewall appeared somewhat compact with its 40 km (24.8 miles) diameter. The eyewall contained only relatively light precipitation, and none of Sandy's eyewall storm cells managed to burst through, or even reach, the tropopause which has about a 10 km (6.2 miles) height at mid-latitudes. Evidence of the weak updrafts in the eyewall comes from the fact that the TRMM radar's reflectivity stayed under 40 dBZ, a commonly cited signal strength at which updrafts can be vigorous enough to form hail and to lift smaller ice particles up through the tropopause and into the stratosphere.But placed in context, the TRMM-observed properties of Hurricane Sandy's eyewall are evidence of remarkable vigor. Most hurricanes only have well-formed and compact eyewalls at category 3 strength or higher. Sandy was not only barely a category 1 hurricane, but Sandy was also experiencing strong wind shear, Sandy was going over ocean typically too cold to form hurricanes, and Sandy had been limping along as a marginal hurricane for several days.Kelley said, \"With infrared satellite observations used in imagery one can speculate about what the sort of convective (rising air that form the thunderstorms that make up a tropical cyclone) storms are developing under the hurricane's cloud tops, but Sandy was sneaking up the East Coast too far out at sea for land-based radars to provide definitive observations of the rain regions inside of the hurricane's clouds.\" The radar on the TRMM satellite could provide this missing information during this overflight of Hurricane Sandy.The TRMM satellite also showed that the super-sized rainband that extended to the west and north of the center did contain vigorous storm cells, as indicated by the red regions of radar reflectivity in excess of 40 dBZ. This rainband is expected to lash the coast well before the hurricane's center make landfall. Even further west, at the upper left corner of the image, one can see two small storm cells. These storm cells are the southern-most tip of the independent weather system that is coming across the United States and that is expected to merge and possibly reinvigorate the remnants of Hurricane Sandy after Sandy makes landfall.On Oct. 29 at 5 a.m. EDT the National Hurricane Center noted that the center of Hurricane Sandy was located near latitude 35.9 north and longitude 70.5 west. This was about 410 miles east southeast of Washington, D.C. Sandy was moving north at 15 mph and its winds had increased since Oct. 28. Maximum sustained winds are now near 85 mph. Tropical Storm force winds extend almost 500 miles from the center.At 8 a.m. EDT on Oct. 29, the National Hurricane Center reported tropical-storm-force winds were occurring along the coasts of southern New Jersey Delaware and eastern Virginia and extend as far inland as the central and southern Chesapeake Bay.Sandy is forecast to make landfall along the southern new jersey coast tonight. However sandy will severely impact the region well before it comes ashore.TRMM stands for Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission, and it is a joint mission between NASA and JAXA, the Japan Space Exploration Agency. Some of the questions about hurricanes left unanswered by the TRMM satellite will be explored by the Global Precipitation Measuring (GPM) satellite scheduled for launch in 2014.

{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_359", "content": "Hurricane Sandy's reach has grown on satellite imagery, and during the morning of Oct. 28, the storm intensified as there was a large pressure drop. The atmospheric pressure dropped to 951 millibars during the morning of Oct. 28, an eyewall formed. When a storm's atmospheric pressure drops by a large amount as Sandy has done, it's a sign the storm is strengthening tremendously.Sandy continues to merge with a cold front. The combination is expected to bring heavy rainfall and tropical-storm-force sustained winds for a couple of days to the mid-Atlantic and northeastern United States, and cause flooding, downed trees and power outages.The National Hurricane Center warned early on Sunday, Oct. 28, that \"Sandy expected to bring life-threatening storm surge flooding to the Mid-Atlantic coast including Long Island sound and New York Harbor, winds expected to be near hurricane force at landfall.\" Storm surge in the Long Island sound is expected between 6 and 11 feet.The MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) instrument on NASA's Terra satellite captured a visible image of Hurricane Sandy on Oct. 26 at 16:10 UTC (12:10 p.m. EDT). The image showed the massive extent of its clouds, covering about 2,000 miles. Sandy's center was in the Bahamas at that time, and an eye was clearly visible. Sandy's western clouds were brushing the southeastern U.S. coast during the time of the image.NOAA's GOES-13 satellite captured a visible image of Hurricane Sandy on Oct. 28 at 1302 UTC (9:02 a.m. EDT) that showed the massive extent of the storm, covering about one-third of the U.S. A line of clouds from the Gulf of Mexico stretching north into Sandy's western circulation are associated with the cold front that Sandy is merging with. Sandy's western cloud edge was already over the Mid-Atlantic and northeastern U.S.This hybrid Sandy is also a super soaker. NASA's Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite can measure rainfall from space. Oct. 27 at 1907 UTC (3:07 p.m. EDT), NASA's TRMM satellite saw that rain associated with Hurricane Sandy storm's center, was moderate and falling at a rate of 20 to 40 mm per hour (1.57 inches per hour). The heaviest rainfall at the time of the image was falling west of the center (and closest to the U.S. East Coast) at a rate of more than 2 inches (50 mm) per hour.During the morning hours of Oct. 28, Sandy has been maintaining a small area of deep (strong) convection (rising air that forms the thunderstorms that make up the hurricane) near the center.The National Hurricane Center has issued Flood Watches for the U.S. East coast and interior areas because Sandy is huge, slow moving and can drop up to 2 inches of rain per hour.As of Oct. 28, 2012, the National Hurricane Center predicts rainfall totals of 3 to 6 inches over far northeastern North Carolina with isolated maximum totals of 8 inches possible. Rainfall amounts of 4 to 8 inches are expected over portions of the mid-Atlantic states, including the Delmarva Peninsula, with isolated maximum amounts of 12 inches possible.Rainfall amounts of 1 to 3 inches with isolated maximum amounts of 5 inches are possible from the southern tier of New York State northeastward through New England.Watches and warnings effective Sunday, Oct. 28, included a tropical storm warning in effect from Cape Fear to Duck, N.C., the Pamlico and Albemarle Sounds, and Bermuda.The tropical storm warnings are somewhat misleading for this massive storm because it is expected to bring its tropical-storm-force winds far inland over a period of days. As a result there are high wind warnings and flood watches up and down the mid-Atlantic coast and northeastern United States that extend quite a distance inland, and are too numerous to mention. For weather warnings in your area, visit On Oct. 28 at 8 a.m. EDT (1200 UTC) Sandy's maximum sustained winds were still near 75 mph (120 kph). The National Hurricane Center discussion noted that \"there is still some short-term potential for sandy to intensify as a tropical cyclone...especially since it will be traversing the Gulf Stream today.\" Sandy's center was near 32.1 North latitude and 73.1 west longitude, about 260 miles (420 km) southeast of Cape Hatteras, N.C. That's also about 395 miles (635 km) south of New York City.Sandy is moving northeast near 10 mph (17 kph) and is expected to continue in that direction for the rest of the day today. However, on Monday, Oct. 28, Sandy is expected to be drawn back to the coast by a low pressure area and turn north and northwest. Sandy will approach the coast of the mid-Atlantic for a landfall late Monday night, Oct. 28.Storm surge is expected to be big factor as Sandy approaches the mid-Atlantic coast. Very rough surf and high and dangerous waves are expected to be coupled with the full moon. The National Hurricane Center noted that the combination of a dangerous storm surge and the tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters. The water could reach the following depths above ground if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide.The National Hurricane Center identified the following areas for storm surges:When a storm becomes extra-tropical and its core changes from warm to cold, the strongest winds spread out and the storm expands. According to the National Hurricane Center, hurricane-force winds again expanded on Sunday, Oct. 28, from 100 miles to 175 miles from the center. Tropical-storm-force winds that extended out 450 miles from the center on Sat. Oct. 27 now extend to 520 miles from the center.The wind field of Sandy will continue to grow in size during the next couple of days and impact states from the Carolinas, west to the Ohio Valley, and north into Maine and Canada.Updates on Sandy are available from the National Hurricane Center at: NASA satellites will continue to provide forecasters at the National Hurricane Center with infrared, visible, cloud height, temperature and rainfall data as Sandy continues to affect the U.S. East Coast."}

The severity of overwash depends on the strength of the storm, the height of the dunes, and how direct a hit the coast takes.\"On the Delmarva Peninsula, near the storm's expected landfall, close to three quarters of the sandy coast is expected to see beach and dune erosion. Fifteen percent of the coast is very likely to be inundated by waves and storm surge,\" said USGS Oceanographer Hilary Stockdon from the USGS St. Petersburg Coastal and Marine Science Center.In these areas, waves and storm surge would transport large amounts of sand across coastal environments, depositing sand both inland and offshore and causing significant changes to the landscape, Stockdon noted.The models show that along the New Jersey shore, 81 percent of the coast is very likely to experience beach and dune erosion, while 7 percent is very likely to experience overwash. It also indicates that on the south shore of Long Island, N.Y., including Fire Island National Seashore, 43 percent of the coast is very likely to experience beach and dune erosion. Overwash and inundation are not expected in these areas because of the relative high dune elevations.According to USGS geologist Cheryl Hapke, many of the sandy beaches along the mid-Atlantic Coast have become increasingly vulnerable to significant impacts such as erosion because of past storms, including Hurricanes Ida (2009) and Irene (2011), as well as large northeastern storms in 2005 and 2007.\"Beaches and dunes often serve as the first line of defense for coastal communities against flooding and other hazards associated with extreme storm\" said Hapke, \"Any compromise to these features means that storm-related hazards are more likely to threaten coastal property, infrastructure, and public safety during a future extreme storm event.\"Beach and dune erosion occurs when storm surge and waves collide with the base of a dune, termed collision in the model, and wash away significant amounts of sand. Overwash happens when these forces exceed dune height and move sand inland. Inundation is a process by which an entire beach system is submerged and, in extreme cases, can result in island breaching.The USGS coastal change model forecasting likely dune erosion and overwash from the storm can be viewed online: For the latest forecasts on the storm, listen to NOAA radio.

{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_361", "content": "Working with various partner agencies such as NOAA, FEMA, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the USGS is securing the storm-tide sensors, frequently called storm-surge sensors, to piers and poles in areas where the storm is expected to make landfall. The instruments being installed will record the precise time the storm-tide arrived, how ocean and inland water levels changed during the storm, the depth of the storm-tide throughout the event, and how long it took for the water to recede.\"In the hours and days before Irene made its epic sweep up the eastern seaboard last year, USGS deployed a record number of storm-surge sensors that yielded important new information on storm tides along some of the most populated coastline in the United States,\" said USGS Director Marcia McNutt. \"Now with Sandy we have the opportunity to test and improve predictive models of coastal zone impact based on what we previously learned.\"Storm-tides are increases in ocean water levels generated at sea by extreme storms and can have devastating coastal impacts. In locations where tidal forecasts are known, the sensors being installed can also help determine storm surge. For differences between storm-surge and tidal-surge, visit the National Hurricane Center's website (This information will be used to assess storm damage, discern between wind and flood damage, and improve computer models used to forecast future coastal inundation.In addition, rapid deployment gauges will be installed at critical locations to provide real-time information to forecast floods and coordinate flood-response activities in the affected areas. The sensors augment a network of existing U.S. Geological Survey streamgages, which are part of the permanent network of more than 7,500 streamgages nationwide.Of the sensors deployed specifically for Sandy, eight have real-time capability that will allow viewing of the storm-tide as the storm approaches and makes landfall. Besides water level, some of these real-time gauges include precipitation and wind sensors that will transmit all data hourly. All data collected by these sensors and the existing USGS streamgage network will be available on the USGS Storm-Tide Mapper link at Providing information to support future forecasts could ultimately save lives during future storms. These sensors were deployed for the first time during Hurricane Rita in 2005. Before then, scientists had limited data available to study the effects of storm surge.\"Forecasters at the National Weather Service rely on USGS real-time and long-term data to improve storm surge models and prepare storm-tide warnings,\" said Brian McCallum, assistant director of the USGS Georgia Water Science Center, who is helping coordinate the sensor installation effort. \"Floodplain managers, federal, state and local emergency preparedness officials, emergency responders, scientists and researchers all benefit from the storm-tide and associated flood data.

{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_362", "content": "NASA's TRMM satellite identified a huge span of moderate rainfall with heaviest rains happening north and east of Sandy's center. NOAA's GOES satellite imagery clearly shows the extent of Sandy's massive cloud cover and the long line of clouds associated with the cold front that stretches from Maine to the Gulf coast.Sandy continues to merge with a cold front and is creating a monster storm with a massive reach. The combination is expected to bring heavy rainfall and tropical-storm-force sustained winds for a couple of days to the Mid-Atlantic and northeastern U.S. beginning late Sunday. Sandy is truly the \"bride of Frankenstorm\" because the storm's circulation is over 2,000 miles and the wind field of tropical-storm-force winds is hundreds of miles in diameter. The Weather Channel cited a concern for power outages from Maine to Virginia as a result of this storm.NOAA's GOES satellite clearly shows the extent of the monster merging of systems. A hybrid image of NOAA's GOES-13 and GOES-15 satellite created on Oct. 27 by the University of Wisconsin's Space Science and Engineering Center, Madison, provided a full view of the cloud cover from Hurricane Sandy interacting with the long line of clouds associated with the cold front approaching the eastern U.S. The composite image was created using SSEC's McIDAS software and NOAA's GOES imager satellite imagery.Washington, D.C. is in the southern end of the bullseye area of Sandy's huge center, and that target area stretches all the way to New York City. That's just the bullseye area, according to the National Hurricane Center. Because Sandy is thousands of miles wide, the storm's powerful effects will be felt all the way to Maine and include strong winds and flooding rainfall. Coastal flooding a very serious concern along the coasts especially in the vicinity of New York City and Raritan Bay, according to the Weather Channel.Washington, D.C. and New York and all areas in between, including Philadelphia, can expect heavy rain and damaging winds over a couple of days. Because Sandy is coming from the south, the conditions will deteriorate from south to north, with Washington, D.C. feeling the worst effects first.In the Nation's Capital, a flood watch was already posted along the D.C. and Baltimore corridor west to Frederick County, Md. and south to southern Maryland beginning Sunday night, Oct. 27 and extended through Tuesday, Oct. 30. Rainfall will depend on the speed and track of the storm, but heavy rainfall can flood rivers and streams through the rest of the week. Like the heavy rainfall, damaging winds of tropical-storm-force are expected over the same period. Tropical-storm-force winds range between 37 mph and 73 mph. In addition, coastal flooding is a serious concern because of the easterly winds pushing the ocean waters against the shoreline, and this is coupled with higher than normal tides by the current full moon.The Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite flew above hurricane Sandy on Friday, Oct. 26 at 1509 UTC (11:09 a.m. EDT) and gathered data on rainfall and cloud heights, revealing the power within this monster storm.Hal Pierce of NASA's TRMM Team at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. created rainfall and 3-D imagery of the storm that revealed the rate at which rain was falling throughout the mammoth storm, and the heights of the thunderstorms within, which are a clue to the storm's power. The higher the thunderstorms that make up a tropical cyclone, the stronger the overall storm, and the heavier the rainfall in those areas of highest cloud tops.TRMM data showed that rainfall was very heavy in some bands north of Sandy's center of circulation and that Sandy's surface center of circulation is exposed south of the main area of convection. The TRMM rainfall analysis was created using data from two instruments on TRMM: TRMM's Microwave Imager (TMI) and Precipitation Radar (PR).Pierce created a 3-D view of Sandy, also using TRMM Precipitation Radar (PR) data that showed that the thunderstorms north of Sandy's center of circulation reached heights of a little above 11km (~6.8 mile). Radar reflectivity values of a little over 45.8dBZ were found in these storms indicating that there were moderate to heavy rain showers in that area.The National Hurricane Center (NHC) indicated that there was significant movement of cold air over the southwest side of Sandy's circulation on Friday, as a result of the cold front moving in from the west. This is expected to speed up Sandy's change to a post-tropical low.A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for the Florida East Coast from Sebastian Inlet to Saint Augustine, South Santee River to Duck including Pamlico and Albemarle Sounds, and Great Abaco and Grand Bahama Islands. A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for the Savannah River to South Santee Rive, the Florida east coast from north of Saint Augustine to Fernandina Beach and Bermuda.On Sat. Oct. 27, at 8 a.m. EDT, Hurricane Sandy's maximum sustained winds were near 75 mph (120 kph). Sandy is a category one hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane wind scale, and regained hurricane strength after weakening to a tropical storm earlier in the day. Sandy was centered near latitude 28.8 north and 76.8 west. Sandy is moving north-northeast near 10 mph (17 kph) and is expected to turn northeast then north on Oct. 28, while slowing down. The center of Sandy will continue moving away from the northwestern Bahamas this morning and will move parallel to the southeast coast of the United States through the weekend, according to the National Hurricane Center.Storm surge is expected to be big factor as Sandy approaches the Mid-Atlantic coast. Very rough surf and high and dangerous waves are expected to be coupled with the full moon. The National Hurricane Center noted that the combination of a dangerous storm surge and the tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters. The water could reach the following depths above ground if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide.As happens when any storm becomes extra-tropical, Sandy will go from a warm to cold core center and the strongest winds spread out and the storm will expand. According to the National Hurricane Center, hurricane force winds have expanded on Saturday, Oct. 27 and now extend outward up to 100 miles from the center. On Oct. 26, those hurricane-force winds were only 35 miles out from the center. Tropical-storm-force winds have also expanded over a huge area on Sat. Oct. 27 and now extend 450 miles from the center! Just a day before, those tropical storm force winds extended outward up to 275 miles (445 km). The wind field of Sandy will contine to grow in size during the next couple of days. The storm's circulation now reaches more than 2,000 miles.NASA satellites will continue to provide forecasters at the National Hurricane Center with infrared, visible, cloud height, temperature and rainfall data as Sandy closes in on the U.S. East Coast.

{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_363", "content": "NASA satellites have provided forecasters at the National Hurricane Center with rainfall data, infrared, visible and other data on Sandy and will continue to do so. Dr. Marshall Shepherd who works with TRMM data provided an insight into the storm's development.The Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite had a partial view of hurricane Sandy on Oct. 25 at 1425 UTC (10:25 a.m. EDT) after it had passed over Cuba and moved into the Bahamas. An eye was hard to find but TRMM's Microwave Imager (TMI) data showed that a large area of intense rainfall was occurring around Sandy's center of circulation. Hal Pierce of NASA's TRMM Team at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. used a GOES-13 satellite image captured at the same time to fill in the part of the image not viewed by TRMM to create a total picture of the storm.With its combination of passive microwave and active radar sensors, TRMM is ideally suited to measure rainfall from space. For increased coverage, TRMM can be used to calibrate rainfall estimates from other additional satellites. The TRMM-based, near-real time Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA) made at NASA Goddard can be used to rainfall over a wide portion of the globe. TMPA rainfall totals were tallied for the seven-day period from Oct. 18-25, 2012.The heaviest rainfall occurred over open ocean where totals were as high as 325 millimeters. Rainfall amounts as high as 250 millimeters were measured over eastern Cuba and some extreme southern areas of Hispaniola.Hurricane Sandy passed over the islands of Jamaica and Cuba causing at least 21 deaths. Extensive flooding and other damage were reported near the capital city of Kingston and other areas of Jamaica.The heavy rainfall potential is evident in the National Hurricane Center's (NHC) forecast on Oct. 26. The NHC noted that Sandy is expected to produce total rainfall amounts of 6 to 12 inches across Haiti and the Dominican Republic with isolated maximum totals of 20 inches possible. Rainfall totals of 3 to 6 inches are expected over portions of the Bahamas with isolated maximum amounts of 12 inches possible. Rainfall totals of one to three inches are expected across the Florida Keys into southeastern and east-central Florida with isolated maximum amounts of six inches possible. Rainfall totals of 4 to 8 inches are possible over far eastern North Carolina.Dr. Marshall Shepherd, University of Georgia Professor and Research Meteorologist has worked with TRMM satellite data since its launch in 1997. Dr. Shepherd provided his take on the storm event. \"Models are coming into consensus on a landfall, if you will, in the DelMarVa area. Comparisons are being made to the Perfect Storm of 1991, but many folks won't remember that. Storm will bring very strong winds (hurricane force) over a strong area. Remember the Derecho of June 29, 2012. Expand that to the entire Delaware/Maryland/Virginia and New York/New Jersey region.\"Shepherd said that the event will bring significant rains and inland freshwater flooding , that he said was often the deadliest threat from tropical systems. He also cited concerns about the storm surge and coastal flooding as full moon will mean elevated water levels/tides coupled with the storm-induced surge. Finally, he noted, there is likely to be heavy wet snow into the inland and higher elevations of the effected region. \"Pay attention to the cone or area of influence rather than a specific track as the storm will affect an area not a point,\" he said.\"Advances from NASA satellites, aircraft, and models are essential for ingest into the models, assessing storm locations and intensity, and testing future modeling techniques. It may not be obvious to many, but our warning and prediction capability does have traceability to the NASA program in numerous ways and I have been happy to play some small role as a former NASA scientist and current member of the NASA Precipitation Science Team and Earth Science Subcommittee of the NASA Advisory Council.\"A Hurricane Warning is in effect for the Northwestern Bahamas Except Andros Island. A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for the Central Bahamas, Florida East Coast from Ocean Reef to Flagler Beach, Lake Okeechobee and Andros Island in the northwestern Bahamas. A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for Savannah River to Oregon Inlet North Carolina, Pamlico Sound, the Florida east coast from North of Flagler Beach to Fernandina Beach, the Florida Upper Keys from Ocean Reef to Craig Key, and Florida Bay.On Friday, Oct. 26, at 8 a.m. EDT, Hurricane Sandy's maximum sustained winds were near 80- mph (130 kph). Sandy is a category one hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane wind scale. Some weakening is possible during the next day or so, according to the National Hurricane Center. It was centered near latitude 26.4 north and longitude 76.9 west. Sandy is moving northwest near 10 mph (17 kph) and is expected to turn north and then northeast on Oct. 27, while slowing down.Storm surge is expected to be big factor as Sandy approaches the Mid-Atlantic coast. Very rough surf and high and dangerous waves are expected to be coupled with the full moon. The National Hurricane Center noted that the combination of a dangerous storm surge and the tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters. The water could reach the following depths above ground if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide. Some storm surge forecasts include: 5 to 8 feet in the hurricane warning area in the Bahamas and one to three feet along the Florida coast in the warning areas on Oct. 26.NOAA's GOES-13 satellite monitors weather over the eastern U.S. and the Atlantic Ocean. In a visible image taken from NOAA's GOES-13 satellite on Friday, Oct. 26 at 1415 UTC (10:15 a.m. EDT) Hurricane Sandy's huge cloud extent of up to 2,000 miles extended into the Atlantic, while its center was over the Bahamas. At the same time a long line of clouds associated with a powerful cold front approaching the U.S. east coast stretched from the upper Midwest to the Gulf coast. The image was created by the NASA GOES Project at NASA Goddard.Hurricane Sandy is expected to mix with a powerful cold front approaching the east coast, and cold Arctic Air mass, setting up for a powerful storm, a \"Frankenstorm.\"The cold front stretching from the upper Midwest to the Gulf coast is moving eastward and is expected to temporarily push Sandy away from the coast. However, the front is expected to break down as it moves toward the coast, allowing Hurricane Sandy to come back toward the coast.As happens when any storm becomes extra-tropical, Sandy will go from a warm to cold core center and the strongest winds spread out and the storm will expand. According to the National Hurricane Center, hurricane force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km) from the center and tropical storm force winds extend outward up to 275 miles (445 km). The wind field of Sandy is expected to grow in size during the next couple of days. The storm's circulation almost reaches 2,000 miles.Although landfall is expected in southeastern Delaware early Tuesday morning as a hurricane, the Mid-Atlantic is expected to start feeling the storm's effect starting Sunday, Oct. 28."}

The MODIS image revealed strong thunderstorms in its southern arm, positioned over the Dominican Republic and Haiti, and eastern Puerto Rico. The center of the storm was moving through the Bahamas, and the northwestern edge had already spread clouds over southern Florida.At 2 p.m. EDT on Oct. 25, Sandy's maximum sustained winds remain near 105 mph (165 kph). The storm is a Category 2 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson wind scale. Sandy's center was located near 23 degrees 30 minutes north latitude and 75 degrees 24 minutes west longitude, just 25 miles (40 km) east of Great Exuma Island, Bahamas. Sandy is moving toward the north near 20 mph (32 kph) and this motion is expected to continue followed by a turn toward the north-northwest. Sandy is expected to remain a hurricane as it moves through the Bahamas.At 11 a.m. EDT, tropical-storm-force winds extended up to 140 miles (220 km) from the center, making Sandy more than 280 miles in diameter. By 2 p.m. EDT, just more than three hours later, Sandy had grown. Sandy's tropical storm-force-winds now extend outward up to 205 miles (335 km) from the center, making the storm about 410 miles in diameter.High pressure rotating clockwise over New England may be set up to push Sandy toward the mid-Atlantic as a cold front approaches from the west. Various computer models are showing different scenarios for Oct. 29's weather along the U.S. East Coast. The current forecast track from the National Hurricane Center brings Sandy in for a landfall in central New Jersey on Tuesday, Oct. 30. Regardless, it appears that Sandy may be a strong wind event for the U.S. mid-Atlantic and Northeast."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_365", "content": "The answer, as it turns out, is yes, and no. While there has never been a documented case of a hurricane making landfall in California, the Golden State has had its share of run-ins and close calls with tropical cyclones. In fact, California has been affected by at least a few tropical cyclones in every decade since 1900. Over that timeframe, three of those storms brought gale-force winds to California: an unnamed California tropical storm in 1939, Kathleen in 1976 and Nora in 1997. But the primary threat from California tropical cyclones isn't winds or storm surge. It's rainfall -- sometimes torrential -- which has led to flooding, damage and, occasionally, casualties.At NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., JPL oceanographer and climatologist Bill Patzert was recently asked about the prospects for future tropical cyclones in Southern California.Patzert: The interesting thing is that it really can't happen, statistically speaking. The odds are infinitesimal -- so small that everyone should just relax. Like 1 in 1,000. Of course, there's always a chance. But there's a good reason why we don't name our West Coast sports teams the Hurricanes, but we do have the Rancho Cucamonga Quakes.Seriously, as eastern Pacific hurricanes move northwest and weaken, what we have had are many instances where they dumped a lot of rainfall in Southern California. That's what happened with two monster storms in 1858 and 1939, both El Nino years. And there have been plenty of other examples. When Southern California does get affected by tropical systems, September is by far the most common month.Patzert: There are two main factors that work against hurricanes here: cool waters off the coast and the direction of the upper-level winds.Tropical cyclones draw their fuel, so to speak, from heat stored in the upper ocean. Typically, ocean surface waters greater than 80 degrees Fahrenheit (27 degrees Celsius) are required to form and fuel these great storms. During the Northern Hemisphere summer and fall, the upper layers of the tropical oceans (down to approximately 330 feet depth) are steadily heated. By September, when hurricane season hits its peak, these waters reach their maximum temperatures, becoming, in a sense, high-octane fuel for hurricanes. But water temperatures never get that high in the coastal waters north of central Baja California. On rare occasions, they may reach about 75 degrees Fahrenheit (24 degrees Celsius) near the shore in Southern California, typically during an El Nino episode. But generally speaking, low 60s is about as warm as they get farther from shore and elsewhere in coastal California.In the Pacific Ocean, the North Pacific Current flows from Japan eastward across the Pacific and then splits into the northern-flowing Alaska Current and the southern-flowing California Current. The cool-water California Current, which sweeps down the West Coast of the United States, really acts as hurricane repellant, protecting California and even Northern Baja California from hurricanes.The other factor at play here is the upper-level winds, which tend to carry and steer storms to the west and northwest, away from California, and also tend to shear the tops off of hurricanes, breaking them apart. Between the upper and lower-level winds, there's a lot of wind shear off the coast here in Southern California. These prevailing northwesterly winds also push warmer surface waters offshore, drawing cooler waters up to the surface, and this further adds to the cool nature of the nearby ocean waters that would weaken any storms that did approach California.Patzert: The best odds for a tropical cyclone to affect Southern California are during a \"Godzilla\" El Nino event, when the waters off the coast are warmest, like we had in 1997-98 when waters were in the low to mid 70s. Or when we're in the positive phase of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), a long-term pattern of change in the Pacific Ocean that alternates between cool and warm periods about every five to 20 years. We're currently in the early stages of a cool phase of the PDO, which tends to dampen the effects of El Ninos. Waters in the eastern Pacific generate more hurricanes during El Nino years.In addition, the upper-level winds would have to steer an unusually strong storm our way. That almost happened with Hurricane Linda in 1997, which briefly threatened Southern California before turning away to sea. But even if Linda had made landfall in California, it wouldn't have been a big wind event. It would have been more like an \"atmospheric river\" event, common in wintertime, with heavy rainfall and flooding. And storm surge, which is a big concern along the U.S. Gulf and East coasts, is really a negligible issue along most of the California coast, because much of it sits atop bluffs, above sea level.Patzert: This hurricane season has been moderately active in the eastern Pacific and slightly busier than normal in the Atlantic, but there have been very few big storms. And locally, our current water temperatures off the Southern California coast are between 65 and 70 degrees Fahrenheit [18 and 21 degrees Celsius]. That's way too cold for hurricanes.Patzert: Nobody knows yet, and if anybody tells you they know the answer to that question, kick 'em out of your Rolodex file. In fact it's possible that there might be fewer hurricanes in a warming world. But the bottom line for Southern Californians is that even if global temperatures were to rise six degrees, a hurricane in California would rank very low on the list of things we'd need to worry about.Patzert: Anytime you get too much rain too quick, it can cause damage and death, as we saw in the winter of 1938-39. But remember that was before we had a reliable observation network, based on ground and copious satellite measurements, which provided for useful forecasts and warnings. In addition, Southern Californians are flood resistant now because of those storms in 1938-39, which led to all the major rivers here being concreted. So we're largely immunized against these kinds of catastrophic flooding events now.Patzert: In the Southeastern United States, an awful lot of the annual water budget comes from tropical storms, which can have a positive impact as drought busters. But tropical cyclones are not a significant contributor to our rainfall here in Southern California. The average rainfall in Los Angeles in September, even with rainfall from occasional tropical cyclones, is less than half an inch. These amounts are small compared to our normal winter total of 15.1 inches (31 centimeters). But we would certainly welcome any rainfall we can get in September and October, because it can help trump the effects of the hot, dry Santa Ana winds and their associated fire threat. And those are far more real threats to Californians than hurricanes will ever be.For more information, including a brief overview of a few of the more notable tropical cyclones to have affected Southern California in recorded history, see the original story at:"}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_366", "content": "The results are published in the How can you examine the frequency of tropical cyclones throughout history when they have not been systematically registered? Today cyclones are monitored from satellites and you can follow their progress and direction very accurately. But it is only the last approx. 40 years that we have been able to do this. Previously, they used observations from ships and aircraft, but these were not systematic measurements. In order to get a long-term view of the frequency of cyclones, it is necessary to go further back in time and use a uniform reference. Climate scientist Aslak Grinsted of the Centre for Ice and Climate at the Niels Bohr Institute at the University of Copenhagen therefore wanted to find some instruments that have stood and registered measurements continuously over a long period of time.\"Tropical cyclones typically form out in the Atlantic Ocean and move towards the U.S. East Coast and the Gulf of Mexico. I found that there were monitoring stations along the Eastern Seaboard of the United States where they had recorded the daily tide levels all the way back to 1923. I have looked at every time there was a rapid change in sea level and I could see that there was a close correlation between sudden changes in sea level and historical accounts of tropical storms,\" explains Aslak Grinsted.Aslak Grinsted now had a tool to create statistics on the frequency of cyclones that make landfall -- all the way back to 1923. He could see that there has been an increasing trend in the number of major storm surges since 1923.Together with colleagues in China and England, he then looked at the global temperatures over the period to see whether there was a trend for a higher frequency of cyclones in a warmer climate. The global temperature has increased 0.7 degrees C since 1923, but there are variations. For example, there was a warm period in the 1940s but the temperature has really risen since 1980.\"We simply counted how many extreme cyclones with storm surges there were in warm years compared to cold years and we could see that there was a tendency for more cyclones in warmer years,\" says Aslak Grinsted.But not all cyclones are equally harmful and those with the highest storm surges tend to cause the most damage. Cyclones with a strength like Katrina, which hit the New Orleans area in 2005 and caused devastating floods and thousands of deaths, make landfall every 10-30 years on average.\"We have calculated that extreme hurricane surges like Katrina are twice as likely in warm years than in cold years. So when the global climate becomes 3 degrees warmer in the future, as predictions show, what happens then?,\" reflects Aslak Grinsted."}

Hurricane Nadine is an anomaly because it has been tracking through the North Atlantic since Sept. 11, when it developed as the fourteenth tropical system of the hurricane season.As of Oct. 2, Nadine has been alive in the north Atlantic for 21 days. According to NOAA, in the Atlantic Ocean, Hurricane Ginger lasted 28 days in 1971. The Pacific Ocean holds the record, though as Hurricane/Typhoon John lasted 31 days. John was \"born\" in the Eastern North Pacific, crossed the International Dateline and moved through the Western North Pacific over 31 days during August and September 1994. Nadine, however, is in the top 50 longest-lasting tropical cyclones in either ocean basin.On Sept. 11, as part of NASA's HS3 mission, the Global Hawk aircraft took off from NASA Wallops at 7:06 a.m. EDT and headed for Tropical Depression 14, which at the time of take-off, was still a developing low pressure area called System 91L.At 11 a.m. EDT that day, Tropical Depression 14 was located near 16.3 North latitude and 43.1 West longitude, about 1,210 miles (1,950 km) east of the Lesser Antilles. The depression had maximum sustained winds near 35 mph. It was moving to the west near 10 mph (17 kmh) and had a minimum central pressure of 1006 millibars.NASA's Global Hawk landed back at Wallops Flight Facility, Wallops Island, Va., on Sept. 12 after spending 11 hours gathering data in the storm, which had strengthened into Tropical Storm Nadine during the early morning hours of Sept. 12.The Global Hawk, one of two associated with the HS3 mission, sought to determine whether hot, dry and dusty air associated with the Saharan air layer was being ingested into the storm. This Saharan air typically crosses westward over the Atlantic Ocean and potentially affects tropical cyclone formation and intensification. During its 26-hour flight around Nadine, the Global Hawk covered more than one million square kilometers (386,100 square miles) going back and forth over the storm in what's called a \"lawnmower pattern.\" The Global Hawk captured data using instruments aboard the aircraft and also dropped sensors called sondes into the storm. These sondes are small sensors tied to parachutes that drift down through the storm measuring winds, temperature and humidity.The Global Hawk investigated Tropical Storm Nadine again on Sept. 14 and 15. During its 22.5 hour flight around Nadine, the Global Hawk covered more than one million square kilometers (386,100 square miles) going again went back and forth over the storm in another lawnmower pattern.\"During the flight, Nadine strengthened from a tropical storm to a hurricane despite being hit by very strong westerly winds at upper levels and very dry air on its periphery,\" said Scott Braun, HS3 Mission principal investigator from NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Md. Data from this flight will help scientists determine how a storm like Nadine can intensify even in the presence of seemingly adverse conditions.NASA's Global Hawk unmanned aircraft departed from NASA Wallops at 2:42 p.m. EDT on Wednesday, Sept. 19 and crossed the Atlantic to take additional measurements in Tropical Storm Nadine. Both the Global Hawk and NASA's TRMM satellite noticed that Nadine had continued to display tropical characteristics, indicating that it had not transitioned to an extra-tropical storm. An extra-tropical storm is one that loses its tropical characteristics, such as when the core of the storm changes from a warm core to a cold core, like a typical mid-latitude low pressure system that is associated with fronts. At that time, Nadine was located in the Atlantic a few hundred miles southwest of the Azores Island.The science portion of the third flight was completed on Sept. 20. Scientists reported that they obtained excellent data from the dropsonde system, which showed some winds on the western side of the storm still reaching 60 knots (69 mph/111 kmh) at middle levels and possibly one measurement of near 60 knots (69 mph/111 kmh) near the surface. The data suggested that Nadine was still a tropical system rather than an extra-tropical system.The three science instruments aboard the Global Hawk performed extremely well, transmitting data back to NASA Wallops for the scientists to analyze and discuss. The plane observed Nadine for more than 12 hours. Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center were using the data supplied by NASA's Global Hawk and noted in the discussion of Nadine at 11 a.m. EDT on Sept. 20, \"The current intensity is kept at 45 knots (51.7 mph/83.3 kmh)â¦is in good agreement with dropsonde data from the NASA Global Hawk aircraft and AMSU [instrument] estimates.\"The fourth science flight of NASA's Global Hawk over Nadine concluded when the aircraft landed at NASA Wallops on Sunday, Sept. 23. The HS3 mission scientists changed the flight path during the Global Hawk flight to be able to overfly Nadine's center that day.\"Measurements from dropsondes found wind speeds greater than 60 knots (69 mph/111 kph) at lower levels above the surface during that adjusted flight leg,\" said Scott Braun. \"Despite the large distance of Nadine from the U. S. East Coast, the Global Hawk was able to spend about 11 hours over the storm.\"The Global Hawk aircraft's fifth investigation of Nadine occurred on Sept. 26 with the aircraft returning to NASA Wallops the next day. While over Tropical Storm Nadine, the storm had maximum sustained winds near 60 mph (95 kmh). Despite adverse conditions, the storm re-intensified to a hurricane the next day, so the HS3 data captured the precursor conditions for intensification.The HS3 mission targets the processes that underlie hurricane formation and intensity change. The data collected will help scientists decipher the relative roles of the large-scale environment and internal storm processes that shape these systems.HS3 is supported by several NASA centers including Wallops; Goddard; Dryden; Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, Calif.; Marshall Space Flight Center, Huntsville, Ala.; and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif.

Over a two-day period in late August 2011, Irene dropped over 11 inches of rain -- 17 percent of the average annual rainfall -- on Esopus Creek that feeds the Ashokan.Yoon found that the volume of water discharged by the creek increased 330-fold, and the creek exported an unprecedented amount of dissolved organic matter to the Ashokan, equivalent to 43 percent of its average annual export. Yoon likened the increase in dissolved organic matter to a person being fed 40 percent of his annual food in a few days.Although not discussed as often as other water quality topics such as turbidity, dissolved organic matter plays a critical role in the aquatic environment and for the provision of clean drinking water. In moderate quantities, dissolved organic matter also provides food and nutrients for microbial communities.In excessive amounts, however, dissolved organic matter could lead to numerous environmental problems, Yoon's study found. Dissolved organic matter binds with metal pollutants and transports them; interferes with ultraviolet processes that reduce pathogens in water; affects aquatic metabolism; and leads to the formation of carcinogenic disinfection byproducts, such as trihalomethanes during chlorination.\"All of those problems become more serious as larger quantities of dissolved organic matter are transported to lakes and coastal systems,\" he said. \"Hurricane Irene was a prime example that there is no limit to the amount of dissolved organic matter that can be exported by extreme rain events. Surprisingly, concentrations of dissolved organic matter didn't get diluted.\"Raymond said that frequent hurricanes will flush more organic matter out of the ground and into lakes, reservoirs and coastal waters, potentially altering their biogeochemical cycles."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_369", "content": "\"Making these measurements possible is the platform on which the instruments are flying,\" said Paul Newman, the deputy principal investigator of NASA's Hurricane and Severe Storm Sentinel (HS3), managed by NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. HS3 will use NASA's unmanned Global Hawks, which are capable of flying at altitudes greater than 60,000 feet with flight durations of up to 28 hours -- capabilities that increase the amount of data scientists can collect. \"It's a brand-new way to do science,\" Newman said.The month-long HS3 mission, which began in early September, is actually a more robust follow-on to NASA's Genesis and Rapid Intensification Processes (GRIP) experiment that scientists executed in 2010. Often referred to as \"GRIP on steroids,\" HS3 is currently deploying one instrument-laden Global Hawk from the NASA Wallops Flight Facility on Virginia's Eastern Shore to look at the environment of tropical storms. In 2013 and 2014, a second Global Hawk will be added that will focus on getting detailed measurements of the inner core of hurricanes.Without this new aircraft, developed originally for the U.S. Air Force to gather intelligence and surveillance data, the team says the mission wouldn't be possible.The Global Hawk's ability to fly for a much longer period of time than manned aircraft will allow it to obtain previously difficult-to-get data. Scientists hope to use that data to gain new insights into how tropical storms form, and more importantly, how they intensify into major Atlantic hurricanes -- information that forecasters need to make better storm predictions, save lives, and ultimately prevent costly coastal evacuations if a storm doesn't warrant them.\"Because you can get to Africa from Wallops, we'll be able to study developing systems way out into the Atlantic,\" Newman explained. \"Normal planes, which can fly for no more than about 10 hours, often miss the points where storms intensify,\" added Gerry Heymsfield, a Goddard scientist who used NASA Research and Development funding to create one of the mission's six instruments, the High-altitude Imaging Wind and Rain Airborne Profiler (HIWRAP). \"With the Global Hawks, we have a much higher chance of capturing these events. Furthermore, we can sit on targets for a long time.\"Just as important as the aircraft are the new or enhanced instruments designed to gather critical wind, temperature, humidity, and aerosol measurements in the environment surrounding the storm and the rain and wind patterns occurring inside their inner cores, they added. \"The instruments bring it all together,\" Newman said. \"We didn't have these instruments 10 years ago.\"The Global Hawk currently on deployment at Wallops is known as the \"environmental\" aircraft because it samples the environment in which hurricanes are embedded. It carries three instruments.A Goddard-provided laser system called the Cloud Physics Lidar (CPL) is located in the nose. CPL measures cloud structures and aerosols, such as dust, sea salt particles, and smoke particles, by bouncing laser light off these elements. An infrared instrument called the Scanning High-resolution Interferometer Sounder (S-HIS), provided by the University of Wisconsin in Madison, sits in the belly of the aircraft. It measures the vertical profile of temperature and water vapor.At the tail end is a dropsonde system provided by the National Center for Atmospheric Research and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. This system consists of 88 paper-towel-roll-sized tubes that are ejected much like a soda can in a vending machine. As the sensor drops, a parachute slows its descent, allowing the sensor to drift down through the storm while measuring winds, temperature, pressure, and humidity.In 2013 and 2014, working in tandem with its environmental counterpart, will be a second Global Hawk, known as the \"over-storm\" aircraft. It will sample the internal structure of hurricanes. It, too, will carry three instruments.Heymsfield's HIWRAP, for example, will be situated in the belly of the Global Hawk and will be responsible for sampling the cores of hurricanes. Similar to a ground radar system, but pointed downward, HIWRAP measures rain structure and winds, providing a three-dimensional view of these conditions.Also onboard this craft will be a microwave system called the High-Altitude MMIC Sounding Radiometer (HAMSR), created by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. Located in the aircraft's nose, this instrument uses microwave wavelengths to measure temperature, water vapor, and precipitation from the top of the storm to the surface.At the other end of the aircraft in the tail section will be the Hurricane Imaging Radiometer (HIRAD) provided by NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala. This microwave instrument measures surface wind speeds and rain rates in an unusual way. It collects this data by measuring the amount of \"foaminess\" in ocean waters. According to Newman, the amount of foaminess is proportional to wind speeds at the surface.Although all six instruments measure different conditions, they share one important characteristic: all operate autonomously and deliver data to scientists in real-time -- another scientific advance. In the past, aircraft instruments, which often required the presence of a scientist to operate them, would record captured data. Only after the aircraft landed could scientists begin evaluating what they had collected.With the Global Hawk, however, the data are transmitted to the ground in real-time. Should conditions warrant, the science team can direct the pilot, who flies the aircraft from a computer console on the ground, to change course or tweak the pre-programmed flight path in some way to maximize or improve the data they are gathering. \"With the Global Hawk and these instruments, we can make better decisions,\" Heymsfield added.The five-year mission will continue through 2014, at which time the team hopes to have dramatically improved their understanding of how storms intensify. \"The insights we get will benefit forecasters,\" Newman said. \"What we hope to do is take this technique and make it part of the operational forecast infrastructure.\"The HS3 mission is supported by several NASA facilities including Wallops, Goddard, NASA's Dryden Flight Research Center at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif., Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, Calif.; Marshall Space Flight Center, Huntsville, Ala.; and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif.

{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_370", "content": "The dike was situated in a specially constructed basin, which the researchers filled with water. The slow addition of water into the basin increased the pressure on the dike. Water forced its way into the dike, and eventually softened the bottom of the dike and shifted the earth underneath, prompting the overall structure to collapse. The study was led by Dutch research institute Deltares, in partnership with Rensselaer and 14 other companies and universities from around the world. It was the research team's third full-scale levee test collapse this summer. The full results of the tests will be presented at the Flood Risk Conference in November 2012 in Rotterdam, the Netherlands.\"The failure of flood-control infrastructure is very real, and can lead to catastrophic flooding as we unfortunately witnessed in 2005 during Hurricane Katrina,\" said Tarek Abdoun, associate dean for research and graduate programs in the School of Engineering and the Judith and Thomas Iovino '73 Career Development Professor in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Rensselaer. \"A large-scale test like this can help supply us with invaluable data to inform and validate our efforts to create a long-term, real-time monitoring system that can assess the health of levees and help identify the vulnerability of levee or dam sections before they fail.\"Rensselaer Research Assistant Professor Victoria Gene Bennett and Associate Professor Mourad Zeghal are collaborating on the project with Abdoun. Their participation in the Deltares project was funded as part of a three-year grant from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Science and Technology Directorate. Abdoun, Bennett, and Zeghal are faculty members of the Rensselaer Center for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (CEES), which is a part of the George E. Brown, Jr. Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (NEES) Program of the National Science Foundation.The collapsed dike was fit with a large number of different sensors, including SAPP (shape-acceleration-pore pressure) arrays that were developed through a partnership between Rensselaer and industrial collaborator Measurand. SAPP sensor arrays are designed to be installed into the ground, beneath and around levees and dams. The cost-effective arrays accurately measure soil deformation, vibration, and pore pressure at critical points of a flood-control system.These SAPP arrays are a critical part of an ongoing Rensselaer-led research project to create an integrated suite of technologies and methods for ensuring the reliability and safety of flood-control infrastructure. The project, funded by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology's Technology Innovation Program, pairs SAPP measurements with GPS and InSAR, or satellite-based interferometric synthetic aperture radar measurements. Accurate down to the millimeter, InSAR captures and analyzes high-resolution satellite images of levees and dams, and measures how far these structures have shifted or sunk due to environmental changes such as rain, floods, tremors, or even aging. To bridge the gap between InSAR satellite data and below-ground SAPP measurements, the researchers will augment the framework with a network of high-resolution GPS sensors to track the physical movement of structures and the ground surface.\"Through our joint venture partnership with Geocomp Corp., a dense grid of instruments including SAPPs, GPS, and radar reflectors has been installed at the London Ave. Canal in New Orleans. The real-time data collected from this site, and others in the New Orleans area, will make performance information available during this and upcoming hurricane seasons, in addition to providing calibration data for health assessment algorithms,\" Bennett said. Led by Zeghal, this project is a collaboration with Bennett, Abdoun, and Birsen Yazici, professor in the Department of Electrical, Computer, and Systems Engineering and the Department of Biomedical Engineering at Rensselaer.Data collected from the SAPP, InSAR, and GPS systems are integrated into an automated \"smart network\" that provides a long-term continuous assessment of the health of levee systems from both underground and aerial perspectives. In the case of a levee failure, data collected by the automated monitoring system will be used to organize a quick emergency response to repair levees and minimize the extent of flooding. Collected data is also being paired with computational simulation techniques to build accurate, predictive models of how different levees will react to different environmental conditions. These models help inform plans to mitigate levee damage and respond to disasters, and provide quantitative assessments that will better allow federal and local governments to prioritize where infrastructure repairs are most needed.In the United States, the national flood-control infrastructure is aging and its structural health is deteriorating, Abdoun said. The system is composed of more than 5,600 km of levees, and 43 percent of the U.S. population lives in counties with levees designed to provide some level of protection from flooding. Some of these levees are as old as 150 years. In 2009, the American Society of Civil Engineers Report Card for America's Infrastructure gave the condition of the nation's dams a grade of D, and levees a grade of D-minus."}

HS3 marks the first time NASA is flying Global Hawks from the U.S. East Coast.According to Chris Naftel, project manager of NASA's Global Hawk program at NASA's Dryden Flight Research Center, Edwards Air Base, Calif., the Global Hawk aircraft took off at 7:06 a.m. EDT and headed for Tropical Depression 14, which at the time of take-off, was still a developing low pressure area called System 91L.At 1500 UTC (11 a.m. EDT), Tropical Depression 14 was located near 16.3 North latitude and 43.1 West longitude, about 1,210 miles (1,950 km) east of the Lesser Antilles. The depression had maximum sustained winds near 35 mph. It was moving to the west near 10 mph (17 kmh) and had a minimum central pressure of 1006 millibars.The National Hurricane Center expects Tropical Depression 14 to strengthen into a tropical storm over the next 48 hours, and turn to the northwest.On Sept. 10, the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite passed over Tropical Depression 14, when it was known as low pressure System 91L and data from TRMM's Microwave Imager (TMI) and Precipitation Radar (PR) were used to create a rainfall analysis. The data was overlaid on a combination infrared and visible image from TRMM's Visible and InfraRed Scanner (VIRS) and showed that System 91L was getting organized and that convective storms reaching heights of about 13km (~8.1 miles) were dropping heavy rain to the northwest and northeast of the center of the circulation.The HS3 mission targets the processes that underlie hurricane formation and intensity change.

{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_372", "content": "\"This approach should give policymakers more reliable information than current state-of-the-art methods,\" says Dr. Nagiza Samatova, an associate professor of computer science at NC State and co-author of a paper describing the work. \"This will hopefully give them more confidence in planning for the hurricane season.\"Conventional models used to predict seasonal hurricane activity rely on classical statistical methods using historical data. Hurricane predictions are challenging, in part, because there are an enormous number of variables in play -- such as temperature and humidity -- which need to be entered for different places and different times. This means there are hundreds of thousands of factors to be considered.The trick is in determining which variables at which times in which places are most significant. This challenge is exacerbated by the fact that we only have approximately 60 years of historical data to plug into the models.But now researchers have developed a \"network motif-based model\" that evaluates historical data for all of the variables in all of the places at all of the times in order to identify those combinations of factors that are most predictive of seasonal hurricane activity. For example, some combinations of factors may correlate only to low activity, while other may correlate only to high activity.The groups of important factors identified by the network motif-based model are then plugged into a program to create an ensemble of statistical models that present the hurricane activity for the forthcoming season on a probability scale. For example, it might say there is an 80 percent probability of high activity, a 15 percent probability of normal activity and a 5 percent probability of low activity.Definitions of these activity levels vary from region to region. In the North Atlantic, which covers the east coast of the United States, high activity is defined as eight or more hurricanes during hurricane season, while normal activity is defined as five to seven hurricanes, and low activity is four or fewer.Using cross validation -- plugging in partial historical data and comparing the new method's results to subsequent historical events -- the researchers found the new method has an 80 percent accuracy rate of predicting the level of hurricane activity. This compares to a 65 percent accuracy rate for traditional predictive methods.In addition, using the network model, researchers have not only confirmed previously identified predictive groups of factors, but identified a number of new predictive groups.The researchers plan to use the newly identified groups of relevant factors to advance our understanding of the mechanisms that influence hurricane variability and behavior. This could ultimately improve our ability to predict the track of hurricanes, their severity and how global climate change may affect hurricane activity well into the future.The paper, \"Discovery of extreme events-related communities in contrasting groups of physical system networks,\" was published online Sept. 4 in the journal"}

The month-long HS3 mission will help researchers and forecasters uncover information about how hurricanes and tropical storms form and intensify.NASA will fly two Global Hawks from Wallops during the HS3 mission. The planes, which can stay in the air for as long as 28 hours and fly over hurricanes at altitudes greater than 60,000 feet, will be operated by pilots in ground control stations at Wallops and Dryden Flight Research Center at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif.The mission targets the processes that underlie hurricane formation and intensity change. The aircraft help scientists decipher the relative roles of the large-scale environment and internal storm processes that shape these systems. Studying hurricanes is a challenge for a field campaign like HS3 because of the small sample of storms available for study and the great variety of scenarios under which they form and evolve. HS3 flights will continue into early October of this year and be repeated from Wallops during the 2013 and 2014 hurricane seasons.The first Global Hawk arrived Sept. 7 at Wallops carrying a payload of three instruments that will sample the environment around hurricanes. A second Global Hawk, scheduled to arrive in two weeks, will look inside hurricanes and developing storms with a different set of instruments. The pair will measure winds, temperature, water vapor, precipitation and aerosols from the surface to the lower stratosphere.\"The primary objective of the environmental Global Hawk is to describe the interaction of tropical disturbances and cyclones with the hot, dry and dusty air that moves westward off the Saharan desert and appears to affect the ability of storms to form and intensify,\" said Scott Braun, HS3 mission principal investigator and research meteorologist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md.This Global Hawk will carry a laser system called the Cloud Physics Lidar (CPL), the Scanning High-resolution Interferometer Sounder (S-HIS), and the Advanced Vertical Atmospheric Profiling System (AVAPS).The CPL will measure cloud structure and aerosols such as dust, sea salt and smoke particles. The S-HIS can remotely sense the temperature and water vapor vertical profile along with the sea surface temperature and cloud properties. The AVAPS dropsonde system will eject small sensors tied to parachutes that drift down through the storm, measuring winds, temperature and humidity.\"Instruments on the 'over-storm' Global Hawk will examine the role of deep thunderstorm systems in hurricane intensity change, particularly to detect changes in low-level wind fields in the vicinity of these thunderstorms,\" said Braun.These instruments will measure eyewall and rainband winds and precipitation using a Doppler radar and other microwave sensors called the High-altitude Imaging Wind and Rain Airborne Profiler (HIWRAP), High-Altitude MMIC Sounding Radiometer (HAMSR) and Hurricane Imaging Radiometer (HIRAD).HIWRAP measures cloud structure and winds, providing a three-dimensional view of these conditions.

The broad area of purple in the image represents cloud-top temperatures colder than minus 63 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 52 degrees Celsius) around the center of the storm's circulation. It is here that Isaac's strongest storms and heaviest rainfall are now occurring.According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Hurricane Center, strong bands of thunderstorms continue to develop over water in the storm's eastern semicircle and southwest of the center. These strong rain bands are forecast to spread gradually to the west tonight across coastal southeastern Louisiana and southern Mississippi, including the New Orleans metropolitan area. The storm is expected to weaken to a tropical depression by Thursday night and a post-tropical remnant low-pressure system by Friday.For more on NASA's Atmospheric Infrared Sounder, visit:"}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_375", "content": "Although it doesn't happen often, hurricanes can cause coastal rivers to reverse flow. Between the extremely strong winds and the massive waves of water pushed by those winds, rivers at regular or low flow are forced backwards until either the normal river-flow or the elevation of the land stop the inflow.As Hurricane Isaac pushes further inland, it is causing storm surge in the Mississippi River as far north as Baton Rouge, where the river has crested at 8 feet above its prior height.\"This reversal of flow of the mighty Mississippi is but one measure of the extreme force of Isaac,\" said USGS Director Marcia McNutt. \"While such events are ephemeral, they are yet another reminder of why we need to respect hurricane warnings.\"When Hurricane Katrina came ashore in 2005, the Mississippi River also reversed flow, cresting at 13 feet above its previous level, with Baton Rouge reaching 9 feet above its previous stage as well.Another phenomenon that USGS streamgages have recorded as Hurricane Isaac moves inland is that periodically, coastal rivers in Louisiana have lost height, only to gain it back again soon after. This rising and falling of the rivers is a common occurrence during hurricanes and is caused by the spiral nature of these storms.As the winds sweep to the southwest, they force water out of the rivers, lowering their height. However, once the winds complete their turn to the southwest, they begin back to the northeast, allowing the storm surge to raise the river levels.These oddities in river behavior are recorded in real-time by USGS' extensive network of streamgages, located through Louisiana and the rest of the country. These streamgages, which are installed along rivers and streams, record data like streamflow, river height, and, in some cases, even water chemistry.Many transmit their data in real-time to satellites, updating with new information every 15 minutes. This wealth of data allows USGS scientists, emergency managers and responders, and even the general public to have accurate and up-to-date knowledge of what the rivers and streams in their areas are doing. This data is particularly critical during massive flooding events like Hurricane Isaac.In fact, anyone can sign up to receive notices from USGS streamgages when waters are rising in nearby rivers and streams through a program called WaterAlert (All USGS streamgage information is housed online (For the latest forecasts on the storm, listen to NOAA radio.

{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_376", "content": "On Aug. 29, 2012 at 1 p.m. EDT, Isaac was still a hurricane with maximum sustained winds near 75 mph (120 kmh). Isaac was located about 10 miles northwest (15 km) of Houma, Louisiana and moving slowly. It is moving to the northwest near 6 mph (9 km). Isaac continued bringing heavy rainfall to southeastern Louisiana and southern Mississippi. The threat for dangerous coastal storm surge and inland flooding are expected to continue overnight.The Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite flew over Hurricane Isaac twice on the night that Isaac made landfall in Louisiana and headed for New Orleans. TRMM is a joint mission managed by both NASA and JAXA, the Japanese Space Agency.In the first of the two overflights, the TRMM radar saw two hot towers in the eyewall of Hurricane Isaac just hours before landfall. While hot towers were shooting up in the eyewall over the ocean, Isaac's inner rainband was already lashing Louisiana with heavy rain. Hot towers are common in intensifying tropical cyclones are are a sign that energy is being pumped into the hurricane from the ocean's surface. A \"hot tower\" is a tall cumulonimbus cloud that reaches at least to the top of the troposphere, the lowest layer of the atmosphere. It extends approximately nine miles (14.5 km) high in the tropics.Two images were created by Owen Kelley, of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Md. The background of the first image showed TRMM infrared observations that give a sense of the height of the cloud cover the hides the heavy precipitation inside of of the hurricane. The blue-gray 3D volume contains the light precipitation inside the hurricane, using a 20 dBZ radar-reflectivity threshold.In the image, an insert reveals details at the center of the hurricane. Two hot towers are indicated by the yellow and orange colors. They are locations where strong updrafts are lifting frozen precipitation above a 14.5 km (9.1 mile) threshold. Water that condenses in updrafts will soon freeze if updrafts lift it above the zero-degree isotherm near 5 kilometers (3.1 miles) altitude. The freezing releases another boost of latent heat, the fuel of hurricanes, following the initial release of latent heat when the water vapor condenses into liquid.The TRMM radar happened to overfly Hurricane Isaac again just five hours later, shortly after the eyewall made landfall. Robbed of its oceanic source of energy, the eyewall hot towers are gone in this later overflight. Instead of reaching 14.5 km (9.1 mile) altitude, the eyewall merely reaches a 10 km (6.2 mile) altitude, which is indicated by the light green shading at the top of the blue-green volume of light precipitation.Unfortunately for New Orleans and surrounding areas, TRMM sees that Hurricane Isaac's eyewall was remarkably well organized at that time, despite having made landfall. The insert shows a ring of very intense radar echos in red, echos that exceed 40 dBZ radar reflectivity. The northwest quadrant of his ring of heavy precipitation is almost on top of New Orleans at the time of observation."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_377", "content": "In 2005, Hurricane Katrina's maximum wind speeds increased dramatically as the storm passed over a warm ocean circulation feature called the Loop Current that is part of the Gulf Stream. The storm evolved quickly from a Category 3 to a Category 5 event on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale in a matter of nine hours as it drew heat from the Loop Current. It subsequently dropped in intensity to a Category 3 storm at landfall.Because the Loop Current and its eddies are warmer, and thus higher in surface elevation, than the surrounding waters, they are easily spotted by satellite altimeter instruments, such as those aboard the NASA/French Space Agency Jason 1 and Ocean Surface Topography Mission/Jason 2 satellites. Scientists use the latest satellite measurements of sea-surface height from these and other satellite altimeters to create maps showing the location, direction and speed of currents in the Gulf of Mexico.This color-enhanced image of sea surface heights in the northeastern Gulf, produced using data from available satellite altimeters, including NASA's Jason-1 and Jason-2 satellites, shows Isaac's path through the Gulf. The storm skirted around the Loop Current, then caught the outer edge of a warm eddy before passing directly over a cold eddy. The storm's track away from the Gulf's warmest waters has helped to keep Isaac from intensifying rapidly, as Hurricanes Katrina and Rita did in 2005.Warm eddies have high heat content and great potential to intensify hurricanes, whereas cold eddies have low heat content and may even cause hurricanes to weaken, as was the case with Hurricane Ivan in 2004.For more on NASA's satellite altimetry missions, visit:"}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_378", "content": "Residents along the northern Gulf coast are bracing for the arrival of Isaac, which was recently upgraded to a hurricane by the National Hurricane Center as of 1:00 p.m. CDT. At that time, the center of Isaac was located about 55 miles (~85 km) south-southeast of the Mississippi and was moving northwest at 10 mph and was nearing southeastern coast of Louisiana.After crossing the southwestern tip of Haiti during the early morning hours of the 25th of August, Isaac paralleled the northern coast of Cuba the following day and moved through the Florida Straits with the center passing about 40 miles (~65 km) south of Key West, Florida on the afternoon of the 26th. All the while, Isaac remained a tropical storm despite passing over warm water. As it entered the southeastern Gulf of Mexico on the afternoon of August 26th, Isaac seemed poised to intensify with plenty of over warm Gulf water ahead and relatively low wind shear. However, even as Isaac moved northwest through this favorable environment into the central Gulf of Mexico, it was slow to intensify, becoming a stronger tropical storm but not a hurricane until just before landfall. Several factors seemed to inhibit Isaac's intensification. Being a large storm, Isaac's wind field is spread over a large area, making it less responsive to changes in central pressure. Also, dry air intrusions hindered the development of an inner core. The lack of an inner core was the main reason Isaac failed to really intensify.TRMM captured an image of Isaac on August 28 at 4:01 UTC (12:01 a.m. EDT) as it was approaching the northern Gulf coast. The image was TRMM shows a broad area of moderate (shown in green) to heavy rain (shown in red) wrapping around the southwestern side of the storm with only moderate to light rain (shown in blue) on the opposite side and no heavy rain near the center. The cloud shield (shown in white) is also well pronounced in the southwestern half of Isaac but inhibited along the northern edge. At the time of this image Isaac was a strong tropical storm with sustained winds of 60 knots (~70 mph). Because of its large size, Isaac stills poses a threat for storm surge and it's expected slower movement over Louisiana brings the risk of flooding.An animation of NOAA's GOES-13 satellite imagery from Aug. 26-28, 2012 of Hurricane Isaac's track through the Gulf of Mexico was animated by NASA's GOES Project at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. The animation shows Isaac is headed for New Orleans, exactly 7 years after hurricane Katrina.The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument on NASA's Terra satellite captured a visible image of Hurricane Isaac as it approached Louisiana on Aug. 28 at 12:30 p.m. EDT. A large band of showers and thunderstorms stretched from the Carolinas, west over Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Florida and into Louisiana, wrapping into Isaac's center of circulation when it was centered about 100 miles south of the mouth of the Mississippi River.On Aug. 28 at 2 p.m. EDT, Hurricane Isaac's maximum sustained winds were near 75 mph (120 kmh). Isaac is a category one hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale. It was centered about 55 miles (85 km) south-southeast of the mouth of the Mississippi River near latitude 28.4 north and longitude 88.7 west. Isaac is moving toward the northwest near 10 mph (17 kmh). The National Hurricane Center expects Hurricane Isaac should reach the coastline of southeastern Louisiana as early as this evening.At 2 p.m. EDT, the National Hurricane Center noted that tropical-storm-force winds were occurring at the mouth of the Mississippi river. That's where a NOAA observing site located at Southwest Pass, Louisiana reported sustained winds of 60 mph (93 kmh) and a gust to 76 mph (122 kmh) at an elevation of 80 feet.

The wooden missiles hit the panels at 100 mph, the speed at which projectiles typically exit a tornado funnel spinning at more than 200 mph. Such a storm would rate EF5 on the Enhanced Fujita scale and be capable of leveling well-built homes. Passing the tornado test means that the panels also exceed the NSSA hurricane threat standard, which fires 9-pound two-by-fours at 60 to 75 mph.The successful test represents a first step toward commercial availability, which the team hopes to achieve by the 2013 tornado season. The final hurdle comes this fall when the assembled structure will undergo testing.\"Our effort to apply modern materials science to storm shelters started in the wake of Hurricane Katrina and grew more urgent after we saw 62 Alabama tornadoes in one day this past April,\" says Uday Vaidya, Ph.D., professor within the UAB Department of Materials Science & Engineering and project leader. In 2011, tornadoes caused 551 deaths nationally -- including 245 in Alabama -- and property damage exceeding $28 billion.\"With an average of more than 1,370 tornadoes per year for the past three years in the United States, it's time we changed they way storm shelters are built with the goal of saving more lives,\" Vaidya says.In the Aug. 1 tests, the UAB panels met the NSSA standards, which are based on Federal Emergency Management Association and International Council Code (ICC 500) requirements. Based on these early results, Vaidya and his team have lined up Sioux Manufacturing to fabricate the tabletop-size panels should the final approvals come through.The team estimated that if merely 30 percent of the roughly 600,000 homes in the Southeast United States were to opt for a storm-shelter retrofit, it would represent a $500 million market. UAB spinoff Innovative Composite Solutions, led by Vaidya and winner of the 2009 Alabama Launchpad Competition, would oversee aspects of panel assembly in Birmingham.No gaps in the armor The recipe of thermoplastic and fiberglass resins and fibers used in the panels are stronger per-unit density than the steel used in many current shelters and weigh 80 percent less, Vaidya says. Some of the same foams and fibers are used in the latest armored military vehicles.The panels, connected to each other and the floor of an interior room, are designed to keep a family from being crushed or becoming airborne and to protect against flying debris. They also leave the assembly line looking like typical interior walls; they do not need paint and never will corrode.Made from discarded liner once used to wrap offshore oil-rig pipes, the panels also embrace green engineering techniques. Recycled materials used in the experimental phase itself kept thousands of pounds of waste from landfills.The design team is continuing to refine the shelter roof and its armored door, which will be sheathed in the same paneling as the walls. The door also will feature a custom three-deadbolt locking system and piano hinges.\"To see panels pass our most extreme test the first time is very impressive,\" says Larry Tanner, P.E., manager of the NSSA/Texas Tech Debris Impact Test Facility. \"This material is lightweight and sustainable and looks to have a bright future in the storm-shelter industry. If it saves even one life, it will have been worth the effort to design it.\"Selvum Pillay, Ph.D., associate professor in the UAB School of Engineering and team member at ICS, says the shelter represents one of many potential applications for a new generation of materials across many fields. \"Related efforts under way at UAB seek to re-engineer the pilings that failed during Hurricane Katrina to flood New Orleans, dampen sound for quieter cities and better fortify combat helmets,\" Pillay says."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_382", "content": "The team focused on the relationship between sea surface temperature and the energy associated with the destructive potential of hurricanes. Rather than seeding storm clouds or hurricanes directly, the idea is to target marine stratocumulus clouds, which cover an estimated quarter of the world's oceans, to prevent hurricanes forming.\"Hurricanes derive their energy from the heat contained in the surface waters of the ocean,\" said Dr Alan Gadian from the University of Leeds. \"If we are able to increase the amount of sunlight reflected by clouds above the hurricane development region then there will be less energy to feed the hurricanes.\"Using a technique known as Marine Cloud Brightening (MCB), the authors propose that unmanned vehicles could spray tiny seawater droplets, a good fraction of which would rise into the clouds above, increasing their droplet numbers and thereby the cloud reflectivity and duration. In this way, more sunlight is bounced back into space, thereby reducing sea surface temperature.The team's calculations, based on a climate ocean atmosphere coupling model (HadGEM1) suggest this could reduce the power of developing hurricanes by one category. Somewhat different cloud-seeding projects, designed to directly influence rainfall amounts, already exist around the world and were most famously used in China during the 2008 Beijing Olympics.\"Data shows that over the last three decades hurricane intensity has increased in the Northern Atlantic, the Indian and South-West Pacific Oceans,\" said Gadian. \"We simulated the impact of seeding on these three areas, with particular focus on the Atlantic hurricane months of August, September and October.\"The calculations show that when targeting clouds in identified hurricane development regions the technique could reduce an average sea surface temperature by up to a few degrees, greatly decreasing the amount of energy available to hurricane formation.One potential drawback to the idea is the impact of cloud seeding on rainfall in neighboring regions. The team noted concerns that seeding in the Atlantic could lead to a significant reduction of rainfall in the Amazon basin and elsewhere. However, if different patterns of seeding were used, such rainfall reductions were not found over land.\"Much more research is needed and we are clear that cloud seeding should not be deployed until we are sure there will be no adverse consequences regarding rainfall,\" concluded Gadian. \"However if our calculations are correct, judicious seeding of maritime clouds could be invaluable for significantly reducing the destructive power of future hurricanes.\""}

The NASA Global Hawk is well-suited for hurricane investigations because it can over-fly hurricanes at altitudes greater than 60,000 feet with flight durations of up to 28 hours.Using unmanned aircraft has many advantages. Hurricanes present an extreme environment that is difficult to sample. They cover thousands of square miles in area, and can also extend up to 50,000 feet in altitude. Second, they involve very high winds, turbulence and heavy precipitation. Third, ground conditions (high winds that create heavy seas or blowing material) make surface observations difficult.\"Several NASA centers are joining federal and university partners in the Hurricane and Severe Storm Sentinel (HS3) airborne mission targeted to investigate the processes that underlie hurricane formation and intensity change in the Atlantic Ocean basin,\" said Scott Braun, principal investigator for the HS3 Mission and research meteorologist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md.Two NASA Global Hawks that will be flying during the HS3 mission. Each will have different payloads, or collections of instruments onboard. Necessary observations are winds, temperature, humidity (water), precipitation, and aerosol (particle) profiles from the surface to the lower stratosphere.The first Global Hawk payload, installed in aircraft No. 872, will consist of three instruments. That payload is for sampling the environment that hurricanes are embedded within. A laser system called Cloud Physics Lidar (CPL) developed at NASA Goddard will be located in the Global Hawk's nose. CPL measures cloud structure and aerosols such as dust, sea salt particles, smoke particles by bouncing laser light off of those particles and clouds. An infrared instrument called the Scanning High-resolution Interferometer Sounder or S-HIS from the University of Wisconsin in Madison, will be located in the belly of the Global Hawk. It can be used to remotely measure or remotely sense the temperature and water vapor vertical profile along with the sea surface temperature and some cloud properties. A dropsonde system from the National Center for Atmospheric Research and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration will be located in the tail of the aircraft. The dropsonde system ejects small sensors tied to parachutes that drift down through the storm measuring winds, temperature and humidity.Global Hawk No. 871 will also carry a payload of three instruments. That Global Hawk's prime responsibility is to sample the cores of hurricanes. A microwave system called the High-Altitude MMIC Sounding Radiometer or HAMSR, created by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., will be located in the aircraft's nose. HAMSR measures temperature, water vapor, and vertical precipitation profiles. y.A radar system called the High-altitude Imaging Wind & Rain Airborne Profiler or HIWRAP from NASA Goddard will be located in the second (No. 871) Global Hawk's belly. It is similar to a ground radar system but pointed downward. HIWRAP measures cloud structure and winds. The Hurricane Imaging Radiometer (HIRAD) from NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala., will be located in the aircraft's tail section. HIRAD measures microwave radiation emitted from the surface and atmosphere. The HIRAD observations yield surface wind speeds and rain rates.y.Both Global Hawks will be flying out of NASA Wallops Flight Facility in September, the peak month for the Atlantic Hurricane Season."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_384", "content": "These results might help improve predictions of a hurricane's power in certain regions. Such conditions occur where large river systems pour fresh water into the ocean, such as by the Amazon River system, the Ganges River system, or where tropical storms rain considerably, as in the western Pacific Ocean.\"Sixty percent of the world's population lives in areas affected by tropical cyclones,\" said ocean scientist Karthik Balaguru at the Department of Energy's Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. \"Cyclone Nargis killed more than one hundred and thirty eight thousand people in Burma in 2008. We can predict the paths cyclones take, but we need to predict their intensity better to protect people susceptible to their destructive power.\"Most hurricanes passing over the ocean lessen in strength as the ocean water cools off due to mixing by the strong winds under the cyclone: this pumps less heat into them. However, Balaguru, his PNNL colleagues and researchers led by Ping Chang at Texas A&M University and Ocean University of China in Qingdao, China found that when enough fresh water pours into the ocean to form what they call a barrier layer, typically about 50 meters below the surface, the ocean water can't cool as much and continues to pump heat into the cyclone. Instead of dying out, the storms grow in intensity by 50 percent on average.A rough estimate for the destruction wreaked by a hurricane is the cube of its intensity. \"A 50 percent increase in intensity can result in a much larger amount of destruction and death,\" said Balaguru.Satellites are very useful for tracking and helping to predict the path of tropical storms as they move across the ocean and develop into cyclones, as well as predicting where the storms will make landfall.But current technology isn't as good at predicting how intense the storm will be when it does. Satellites can only see the ocean from above, but it's the ocean's heat that feeds the storm. So Balaguru decided to look at the ocean itself.To do so, Balaguru started with one hurricane: Omar. Omar nearly topped the scales as a Category 4 storm in the eastern Caribbean Sea in October 2008, causing $79 million in damages. Balaguru and colleagues collected data about ocean conditions including water temperature, salt content, and water density, and compared that data to the intensity of the storm.Most of the time, a tropical storm travels across the ocean, where its winds suck up heat from the ocean and builds. But then the heat loss from the water mixes the surface layer -- the warmest, least dense layer of ocean water -- and dredges up colder water from the ocean below it. The colder water cools off the surface temperature, providing less energy and lessening the storm's intensity.It made sense that conditions that would prevent the top ocean layer from cooling off would increase the intensity of storms, so Balaguru zoomed in on Omar's conditions. As expected, the ocean surface cooled the least along Omar's path as the storm peaked in intensity.However, when Balaguru looked at the structure of the ocean along Omar's path, he saw another layer, called a barrier layer, between the surface and the colder ocean below. Omar's most intense episodes occurred when it found itself over these thick barrier layers.But Omar was just one storm. To determine whether the barrier layer connection was real, Balaguru looked at hundreds more tropical storms.Balaguru and colleagues examined 587 tropical storms and cyclones between 1998 and 2007 in the western tropical Atlantic, the western Pacific and the northern Indian Oceans.They found that the tropical storms over thick barrier layers cooled off 36 percent less than storms over areas lacking barrier layers, and barrier layer storms drew 7 percent more heat from the ocean than other storms. That translated into 50 percent more intense hurricanes on average.The barrier layer has this effect on storms, Balaguru said, because it insulates the surface layer from the colder water below, preventing the storm's access to cooling water. When fresh water dumps into the salty ocean, it makes the surface layer less salty, creating the barrier layer below it. When a passing storm causes the surface layer to pull up water from below, the water comes from the barrier layer rather than the much colder water beneath.The team supported their observational analysis with a computer model, comparing tropical cyclones over regions with and without barrier layers. The model found a similar decrease in cooling by the barrier layer storms, more heat transferred from the ocean to the storm, and a similar intensification.This work addressed what happens to hurricanes now, under current climate conditions. Scientists predict that global warming will have an effect on the ocean water cycle. Future research could explore how the distribution of the barrier layers changes in a warmer world.This work was supported by the Department of Energy Office of Science, the U.S. National Science Foundation, the National Science Foundation of China, the Chinese National Basic Research Program and the Chinese Ministry of Education."}

Also, strong early-season activity is generally indicative of a more active season.\"However, NOAA seasonal climate forecasters also announced today that El NiÃ±o will likely develop in August or September.\"El NiÃ±o is a competing factor, because it strengthens the vertical wind shear over the Atlantic, which suppresses storm development.

{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_386", "content": "After the upload of specialized science equipment is complete, the two Global Hawks will fly from one coast of the United States to another over sparsely populated areas and open water to reach NASA's Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia.NASA Wallops was selected as a deployment site because the area of scientific interest is the Atlantic Ocean, especially the eastern Atlantic where hurricanes begin to form. Flights from the U.S. East Coast take less transit time to the target than those from NASA Dryden and allow the aircraft to travel further out over the Atlantic and collect data for a longer period of time.Waiting at Wallops will be a mobile ground control center, mobile payload operations center and Ku-band satellite dish -- all necessary for operation of the high-altitude and long-endurance aircraft. Scientists, maintenance personnel and three pilots will support flights from Wallops.During take off and landing of the Global Hawk, the aircraft must be in line-of-sight communications with the pilot. The pilots deployed to Wallops will manage this activity from the Global Hawk Mobile Operations Facility, handing off operation of the aircraft to Dryden after reaching an altitude of approximately 30,000 feet.Additional pilots sitting in Dryden's Global Hawk Operations Center will receive the verbal hand-off via telephone, cross check data links with pilots at Wallops, and assume responsibility for the aircraft's operation until the mission is completed when the landing operation transfers back to Wallops. This close coordination alleviates the necessity to deploy a larger number of pilots.When an unmanned aircraft is in the air, the ground-based pilots maintain continual contact with Federal Aviation Administration air traffic control specialists.The interesting scenario for HS3 is that the pilots are in California's Mojave Desert, talking with East Coast controllers through a radio located on the aircraft. When flying in oceanic airspace, pilots talk with international controllers over telephone. This communication is vital as air traffic controllers provide the altitude and number of other aircraft sharing the same area of the U.S.'s National Airspace System and international air space as the NASA aircraft. When the Global Hawk reaches an altitude of between 60,000 and 65,000 feet, there are few aircraft competing for space.Although the flight path of the Global Hawk is pre-programmed into the aircraft's flight control computers prior to a mission, pilots are able to override the flight plan to accommodate the scientists' requests. The scientists will observe flights from the mobile payload operations facility at Wallops where information will stream onto computer monitors from their instruments. The payload manager at Wallops will send the scientists' request for change in altitude or course to Dryden's mission director in the control room with the pilots at Dryden. The pilots operating the Global Hawk change the flight path by entering a new heading, airspeed or altitude on the primary flight display.All Global Hawk pilots are rated to fly manned aircraft. The pilots commented that it is possible to become so engaged during a Global Hawk flight that it seems like a flying a manned aircraft. They add that much of the sensory information available to pilots of manned aircraft is missing for the unmanned aircraft pilots. It is not possible to smell the fuel, see the weather and terrain, hear the engine starting, or feel the movement from a ground control center. An unmanned aircraft pilot is dependent upon computers and their displays for updates on the health of the vehicle.The Global Hawk pilots will have to deal with turbulence in the hurricane flights. Fortunately, the cruise altitude is above most of the unstable air associated with that weather phenomenon. In addition, an instrument measuring turbulence was adapted and will be installed with the science payload.Global Hawk pilots will be well-prepared for the Hurricane and Severe Storm Sentinel mission. They spend hours planning missions, flying a simulator and have a support team in the \"cockpit\" consisting of a co-pilot, mission director and control room operator. Many are seasoned from flying this type aircraft for the military. Although their tools are a mouse, keyboard and computer displays, the NASA Global Hawk pilots find their work challenging and are proud of the job they do to support the U.S. science community."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_387", "content": "Keller, a University of Wisconsin-Madison professor of medical history and bioethics, is compiling a detailed account of the epic 2003 heat wave that broiled parts of Europe that summer and killed an estimated 70,000 people.During the course of three excruciating weeks in August of that year, a massive high-pressure system parked over Europe, producing the hottest summer weather in more than 500 years and leading to most of those fatalities. It was so hot electrical cables melted, nuclear reactors could not be cooled, water pumps failed, and museum specimens liquefied.By comparison, Hurricane Katrina and its floods, which devastated New Orleans and the Gulf Coast in 2005, exacted a death toll of 1,836 people.France, in particular, was hard hit by the deadly 2003 heat wave, when temperatures surpassed 100 degrees Fahrenheit on seven days. \"Measured by mortality, it was the worst natural disaster in contemporary France,\" says Keller, who with support from the UW-Madison Graduate School, the National Science Foundation and the city of Paris is working on a history to detail the effects of the heat wave on the City of Light where, according to official tallies, 14,802 people died.The catastrophe, occurred at a time when many Europeans, including government officials and physicians, were on annual holiday and was first sensed by undertakers, who were being overwhelmed with unclaimed bodies, some of which had to be stored in a refrigerated warehouse outside the city as mortuaries ran short of space.Contributing to the death toll, explains Keller, were a host of social variables such as age of the victims, social status, gender and where they lived. In Paris, many of the victims were elderly women who lived alone, usually on the top floors of cheap, poorly ventilated walk-ups.\"People who lived in these apartments died like flies,\" according to Keller. \"This was as much a social as a health and epidemiological disaster. There were social factors that made some people much more vulnerable.\"Age, of course, put many victims at more physiological risk. The elderly often don't notice the effects of dehydration and so tend not to drink enough water. And the medications many older people take can exacerbate the effects of extreme heat as can medications used to treat psychiatric disorders and neurological conditions like Parkinson's disease.However, Keller, who pored over records of the dead, visited their neighborhoods and talked to friends and relatives, found that the greatest risk was to people who lived on their own.\"The single biggest factor for dying was if you lived alone,\" he says.The social dynamics of death from extreme heat, argues Keller, can be instructive as heat waves seem to be occurring more frequently and with greater intensity and duration: \"Vulnerability to extreme events is more complex than we know and we need to think about broader scale adaptation,\" Keller says, noting that we build homes, apartments and public housing with more attention to staying warm in the winter than keeping cool during the dog days of summer.\"We have to recognize that heat kills far more people than the cold and that those most likely to die are people on the social margins of society,\" Keller says."}

In addition to SoulÃ©, the other authors were Dr. Paul Knapp from UNC Greensboro and Dr. Jason Ortegren from the University of West Florida.Â They found that during the 58-year period, up to 41 percent of all droughts and at least 20 percent of droughts in three-fourths of the climate divisions in the Southeast were ended by tropical cyclone drought busters. In addition, they found that 4 to 10 percent of all rainfall in the Southeast occurred during the tropical cyclone season and that as much as 15 percent of rainfall in the Carolinas occurred from tropical cyclones.\"It turns out tropical cyclones were a very important process for ending drought,\" SoulÃ© said of the time period and region studied.\"Drought can be a far worse natural hazard in terms of cost because it is so long lived and affects such large areas,\" SoulÃ© said. \"In the broad scheme of natural hazards it tends to rank high in terms of cost. People don't usually think about how bad drought can be and how much money drought can cost.\"For example, the 1988 drought is estimated to have caused between $80 and $120 billion in damage including crop losses and destructive wildfires. Last year's drought across the Southeast cost more than $10 billion in agricultural losses. Droughts also impact urban and rural water quality.Currently, 65 percent of the U.S. is experiencing drought, according to the drought monitor website at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln (Last year's season saw only one storm to make landfall in the Southeast.\"This year has been unusual in that we have already had four named storms, two which developed in May before the official beginning of the hurricane season on June 1,\" SoulÃ© said. \"But there is no way to know what this season is going to hold.\""}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_389", "content": "The study used birth records from Texas and meteorological information to identify children born in the state between 1996 and 2008 whose mothers were in the path of a major tropical storm or hurricane during pregnancy. The children's health at birth was compared with that of siblings whose gestation didn't coincide with a major weather event.The study found that mothers living within 30 kilometers of a hurricane's path during their third trimester were 60 percent more likely to have a newborn with abnormal conditions, which are detailed on birth records. Those conditions included being on a ventilator for more than 30 minutes or experiencing meconium aspiration, which occurs when a newborn breathes in a mixture of meconium -- or early feces -- and amniotic fluid around the time of delivery. Increased risk was also found following exposure to weather-related stressors in the first trimester, while evidence was less clear for exposure in the second trimester. The researchers were able to isolate the impact of stress caused by the storm from other factors, such as changes in the availability of health care in a storm's aftermath.The study breaks ground by honing in on new -- and potentially better -- ways to measure the impact of prebirth stress on newborns and opens avenues for further research into the potential impact on such children's later development, said lead researcher Janet Currie, Princeton's Henry Putnam Professor of Economics and Public Affairs at the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs and director of the Center for Health and Wellbeing.\"Probably the most important finding of our study is that it does seem like being subjected to stress in pregnancy has some negative effect on the baby, but that the effect is more subtle than some of the previous studies have suggested,\" said Currie, who conducted the study along with Maya Rossin-Slater, a doctoral candidate in the Department of Economics at Columbia University.Anna Aizer, associate professor of economics and public policy at Brown University who wasn't involved in the study, said the research \"really raises the bar in terms of identification of the effect of stressful events in-utero on birth outcomes.\"\"Previous work has not really been able to isolate the effect as well as Currie and Rossin-Slater have,\" said Aizer, whose research focuses on issues related to children's well-being.Meconium aspiration -- usually a sign of fetal distress -- and other respiratory problems that necessitate a baby being placed on a ventilator can generally be treated successfully, but the study offers new paths for future research about the long-term health of children born in the wake of stressful events such as hurricanes.\"I think there's every reason to believe that if you have a better measure of child health -- like you knew this child was having breathing problems at birth -- that might be a stronger predictor of longer-term outcomes,\" Currie said. \"There's a lot of interest in this whole area of how things that happen very early in life can affect future outcomes.\"Previous research into the impact of similar types of stress has found changes in length of gestation and birth weight, but the new study didn't find a significant effect on those measures, Currie said.Currie said one explanation for the difference is that the new study utilized data that allowed the researchers to control for changes in the population of an area around the time of a storm that could have affected the previous findings. Earlier research hasn't been able to account for the way the population of an area changes around the time of a stressful event -- with people of certain demographic groups more likely than others to move away or stay nearby.The new study included data on eight hurricanes and tropical storms that hit any part of Texas between 1996 and 2008 and caused more than $10 million damage. The most damaging storms were Tropical Storm Allison in 2001, which caused more than $50 billion in damage and 40 deaths, and Hurricane Ike, which caused $19.3 billion in damage and 103 deaths.Experiencing a hurricane or major tropical storm can have a significant impact on people that goes well beyond stress. However, Currie said the researchers were able to determine that findings related to abnormal health conditions at birth generally weren't tied to disruption of medical care or property damage caused by the storms, such as damage to an expectant mother's home that might lead to injury or increased risk of illness. They also found little consistent evidence that the stress associated with storms affected mothers' behaviors, such as smoking, eating as reflected in weight gain and use of prenatal care.One potential cause of the health problems found in the study is an increase in stress hormones caused by the storm, which occurred in what is known as the neuroendocrine pathway.\"I think the takeaway finding is that it's worth doing more focused research on those pathways and looking for more subtle effects on the fetus than just looking at birth weight and preterm delivery,\" Currie said. \"And it would be really great if we could follow over time and see what happens to children who are affected by these types of events.\"Aizer said the research could also have implications beyond the context of natural disasters.\"Previous work has shown poor mothers are exposed to more stressors. Currie and Rossin-Slater's work suggests that exposure to stress might be one of the mechanisms explaining why poor women have worse birth outcomes,\" Aizer said. \"Policymakers concerned with improving the outcomes of poor families should consider these findings.\"The study, which is described in a working paper circulated in May by the National Bureau of Economic Research, was supported by funding from the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development."}

These models are the foundation for all public and private weather forecasts in the United States.The Suomi NPP polar-orbiting satellite circles Earth every 102 minutes, flying 512 miles above the surface, capturing data from the land, oceans and atmosphere. It carries five instruments, including the Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder (ATMS), which captures atmospheric temperature and water vapor information used to assess the atmosphere and predict weather.\"It takes tremendous effort to ensure data from a new satellite are accurate and ready to be used in advanced numerical weather models. Reaching this milestone clearly demonstrates the effectiveness of the partnership between NOAA and NASA and also speaks to the urgency both agencies have for getting these data into NOAA's weather models to enhance our forecasts,\" said Kathryn Sullivan, Ph.D., NOAA deputy administrator.Sullivan added, \"This data stream from Suomi NPP ensures NOAA will continue to provide life-saving forecasts. This is welcome news after the devastating weather events of 2011, and as the United States comes closer to becoming a Weather Ready Nation.\"Along with the ATMS, another Suomi NPP instrument, the Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS), is producing higher spatial and vertical resolution data about the atmospheric temperature and water vapor which, when fully operational, will improve NOAA's weather prediction models for both short and long-term forecasts. In addition to the ATMS and CrIS, three other instruments (the Visible Infrared Imaging radiometer Suite (VIIRS), the Ozone Mapping and Profiler Suite (OMPS), and the Clouds and Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) are flying on Suomi NPP and are performing well.ATMS also benefits NOAA's hurricane forecasters. When ATMS looks into the eye of a hurricane, it will help provide a clearer picture of the hurricane's warm core and the intensity of its rainfall. Additionally, CrIS will provide more accurate data to the global observing system with the potential to improve prediction for hurricanes and other devastating weather events.NOAA officials credit the accelerated ATMS data flow to a focused commitment and unprecedented science partnerships within NOAA and through the NASA-NOAA-NSF-Department of Defense Joint Center for Satellite Data Assimilation (JCSDA) that sped the development of software used in the advanced models. The JCSDA, established in 2001, was created to speed up the time it takes for data from a newly launched satellite to be used operationally in forecasts. NASA provided the ATMS instrument.The Suomi NPP mission is the bridge between NOAA's Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite (POES) and NASA's Earth Observing System satellites to the next-generation Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS), which NOAA will operate. The JPSS program is now operating Suomi NPP, which is the first spacecraft in the JPSS series. The second in the series, JPSS-1, is on track to launch in 2017."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_391", "content": "Two satellites have captured imagery that shows Tropical Storm Debby has thrown a large white blanket of clouds over the state of Florida, and it doesn't seem like that blanket is going to lift quickly as Debby moves slowly north.NASA's Aqua satellite passed over Tropical Storm Debby and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument onboard the satellite captured a visible image of the storm on Sunday, June 24 at 3:00 p.m. EDT. The image clearly showed Debby's center over the northeastern Gulf of Mexico, and the bulk of the clouds, showers and thunderstorms wrapping from the north to the east to the south of the center of circulation and covering the entire state of Florida. The northern-most extent of Debby's clouds were over southern Alabama and south Georgia. Tropical-storm-force winds on June 25 extend outward up to 230 miles (370 km) mostly southeast of the center, and the imagery from MODIS shows that the cloud cover is most extensive in that direction.On Monday, June 25, 2012 at 11 a.m. EDT, Debby's maximum sustained winds had dropped to 45 mph (75 kmh). It was located just 75 miles south of Apalachicola, Florida, near 28.6 North and 85.2 West. Debby was crawling to the north at 3 mph (6 kmh). Debby's minimum central pressure was 995 millibars.On June 25, 2012 at 11:45 a.m. EDT a visible satellite image of Debby captured by NOAA's GOES-13 satellite showed that the storm's clouds continued to blanket all of Florida. The image also showed that the bulk of Debby's clouds and showers continued to be from northeat to southeast of the center of circulation, which was still in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico. Both the GOES-13 and the MODIS satellite images were created at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md.The National Hurricane Center (NHC) noted that Debby is expected to continue crawling to the northeast or east-northeast over the next couple of days, bringing more soaking rains for the sunshine state. The NHC doesn't expect much change in intensity, however.As a result of Debby's new more northerly track, some of the warnings and watches have been changed as of 11 a.m. on June 25. The tropical storm warning from the Florida-Alabama border to Destin, Fla. has been discontinued. In addition, the tropical storm watch from the Suwannee River to Englewood has been changed to a tropical storm warning. The tropical storm warning area now covers the Florida Gulf Coast from Destin to Englewood.A quick look at watches and warnings in effect on Monday, June 25 for three western Florida cities tell the story of what Debby is doing to its residents. In Tampa, there is a Tropical Storm Warning, a Coastal Flood Warning, a Tornado Watch, a Flood Warning, a High Surf Advisory and a Flood Watch as a result of Debby. Further north in Pensacola, there is a High Surf Advisory and a Wind Advisory. South of Tampa in Fort Myers,there is a Tornado Watch, Coastal Flood Advisory, High Surf Advisory and Flood Watch.Tropical-storm-force winds are expected to continue over portions of the Florida Gulf coast today. Heavy rainfall is a key concern today, after Florida was soaked yesterday from Debby. According to the NHC, northern and central Florida can see accumulations of 10 to 20 inches with as much as 25 inches. Southeastern Georgia and extreme South Carolina will also feel Debby's wet wrath, as totals between 5 and 15 inches are possible in both areas.Storm surges are expected to range between one and five feet along the Gulf coast between Apalachee Bay to southeastern Louisiana. Isolated tornadoes are also a threat as they are with any landfalling tropical cyclone. Some are possible today across the eastern Florida panhandle, Florida peninsula and southern Georgia.NASA's Kennedy Space Center on the Atlantic coast is included in a tornado watch for the area due to a line of thunderstorms approaching from the west. Elevated winds are expected throughout the day and for the next few days. Between one to three inches of rainfal are expected over the next day, and are likely to continue as Debby crawls northward."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_392", "content": "For the entire six-month season, which begins June 1, NOAA's Climate Prediction Center says there's a 70 percent chance of nine to 15 named storms (with top winds of 39 mph or higher), of which four to eight will strengthen to a hurricane (with top winds of 74 mph or higher) and of those one to three will become major hurricanes (with top winds of 111 mph or higher, ranking Category 3, 4 or 5). Based on the period 1981-2010, an average season produces 12 named storms with six hurricanes, including three major hurricanes.\"NOAA's outlook predicts a less active season compared to recent years,\" said NOAA Administrator Jane Lubchenco, Ph.D. \"But regardless of the outlook, it's vital for anyone living or vacationing in hurricane-prone locations to be prepared. We have a stark reminder this year with the 20th anniversary of Hurricane Andrew.\" Andrew, the Category 5 hurricane that devastated South Florida on August 24, 1992, was the first storm in a late-starting season that produced only six named storms.Favoring storm development in 2012: the continuation of the overall conditions associated with the Atlantic high-activity era that began in 1995, in addition to near-average sea surface temperatures across much of the tropical Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea, known as the Main Development Region. Two factors now in place that can limit storm development, if they persist, are: strong wind shear, which is hostile to hurricane formation in the Main Development Region, and cooler sea surface temperatures in the far eastern Atlantic.\"Another potentially competing climate factor would be El NiÃ±o if it develops by late summer to early fall. In that case, conditions could be less conducive for hurricane formation and intensification during the peak months (August-October) of the season, possibly shifting the activity toward the lower end of the predicted range,\" said Gerry Bell, Ph.D., lead seasonal hurricane forecaster at NOAA's Climate Prediction Center.\"NOAA's improvement in monitoring and predicting hurricanes has been remarkable over the decades since Andrew, in large part because of our sustained commitment to research and better technology. But more work remains to unlock the secrets of hurricanes, especially in the area of rapid intensification and weakening of storms,\" said Lubchenco. \"We're stepping up to meet this challenge through our Hurricane Forecast Improvement Project, which has already demonstrated exciting early progress toward improving storm intensity forecasts.\"Lubchenco added that more accurate forecasts about a storm's intensity at landfall and extending the forecast period beyond five days will help America become a more Weather-Ready Nation.In a more immediate example of research supporting hurricane forecasting, NOAA this season is introducing enhancements to two of the computer models available to hurricane forecasters -- the Hurricane Weather Research and Forecasting (HWRF) and the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) models. The HWRF model has been upgraded with a higher resolution and improved atmospheric physics. This latest version has demonstrated a 20 to 25 percent improvement in track forecasts and a 15 percent improvement in intensity forecasts relative to the previous version while also showing improvement in the representation of storm structure and size. Improvements to the GFDL model for 2012 include physics upgrades that are expected to reduce or eliminate a high bias in the model's intensity forecasts.The seasonal outlook does not predict how many storms will hit land. Forecasts for individual storms and their impacts are provided by NOAA's National Hurricane Center, which continuously monitors the tropics for storm development and tracking throughout the season using an array of tools including satellites, advance computer modeling, hurricane hunter aircraft, and land- and ocean-based observations sources such as radars and buoys."}

{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_394", "content": "An awareness of which bridges are most at risk of damage in a strong hurricane helps public safety officials, said Jamie Padgett, a Rice assistant professor of civil and environmental engineering.\"We've been sharing these findings with emergency management agencies,\" Padgett said. \"Some of the groups, particularly in the Clear Lake area, are interested in this information so they can plan emergency response routes, or at least do some hypothetical scenarios to think through their responses.\"Padgett leads a research team modeling the performance of dozens of bridges in the Houston-Galveston region. They're determining how well bridges would withstand such a hurricane from their assessment of damage by 2008â²s Ike, the third-costliest storm in American history.Padgett and Matthew Stearns, a former undergraduate student in her lab, wrote about the effect of hurricanes on bridges in a new book, \"Lessons From Hurricane Ike,\" based on analyses after Ike and Hurricane Katrina in 2005. The book was published recently by Texas A&M University Press. The book incorporates material from more than 20 researchers associated with the Rice-based Severe Storm Prediction, Education and Evacuation from Disasters (SSPEED) Center.After Ike, Padgett and Stearns published a paper in the American Society of Civil Engineers' journal on the impact of Ike on bridge infrastructure in Greater Houston and Galveston.The first bridge featured in their lengthy report was the Rollover Pass Bridge on Bolivar Peninsula, northeast of Galveston. In 2008, the span, which sat 5.3 feet over the mean water elevation, was given National Bridge Inventory condition ratings of \"good\" for the superstructure and substructure, \"very good\" for the deck and \"satisfactory\" for the channel; yet that same year it was destroyed in Ike's 15-foot surge and five-foot waves. This highlights the fact that condition ratings alone are not sufficient indicators of bridge safety, particularly in the face of natural hazards, Padgett said, and it underscores the importance of risk-assessment studies such as those conducted by her group.The bridge was one of 53 evaluated by Padgett and her team after Ike. They used data compiled by themselves and others, including the Texas Department of Transportation and design firm HNTB, which worked on the state's recovery effort. Some bridges (mostly timber structures in rural areas) were destroyed by the storm surge and wave loading. Others were damaged by debris impact that accompanied the wind and water, and 25 more were weakened by scouring, where earth underneath the structures and supporting elements was washed away. Even 17 of the evaluated bridges that were far enough inland to escape significant storm surge suffered some degree of damage.Advances in high-strength, corrosion-resistant materials and new design and construction techniques will help the next generation of bridges withstand such damage, said Padgett, who earned a coveted CAREER award from the National Science Foundation (NSF) last year to model sustainable solutions for bridge infrastructure subjected to multiple threats. But there are also fixes available to help existing bridges. \"Through our work, we've identified some simple solutions,\" she said. \"Adding details and retrofits to the structures, like shear keys or tie-downs, are potential solutions that would help protect bridges during hurricanes.\"Padgett said the Houston Endowment's support of the SSPEED Center, along with her NSF award, were critical to her work. Her group also studies the impact of earthquakes and other factors, including increased load from a growing population, on bridges.\"Infrastructure reliability is certainly a hot topic worldwide,\" said Padgett, who is also studying bridges in California and Charleston, S.C. \"We try to pick strategic locations that have an array of threats.\""}

These \"severe storm sentinels\" will investigate the processes that underlie hurricane formation and intensity change. NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., will join several other NASA centers and numerous federal and university partners in the HS3 mission.The autonomously-flown NASA Global Hawk aircraft are well-suited for hurricane investigations. They can over-fly hurricanes at altitudes greater than 18,300 meters (60,000 feet), and fly up to 28 hours at a time -- something piloted aircraft would find nearly impossible to do. Global Hawks were used in the agency's 2010 Genesis and Rapid Intensification Processes (GRIP) hurricane mission and the Global Hawk Pacific (GloPac) environmental science mission. The Global Hawks will deploy from NASA's Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia and are based at NASA's Dryden Flight Research Center on Edwards Air Force Base, Calif.\"Hurricane intensity can be very hard to predict because of an insufficient understanding of how clouds and wind patterns within a storm interact with the storm's environment,\" said Scott Braun, HS3 mission principal investigator and research meteorologist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. \"HS3 seeks to improve our understanding of these processes by taking advantage of the surveillance capabilities of the Global Hawk along with measurements from a suite of advanced instruments.\"One aircraft will sample the environment of storms while the other will measure eyewall and rainband winds and precipitation,\" Braun continued. HS3 will examine the large-scale environment that tropical storms form in and move through and how that environment affects the inner workings of the storms.HS3 will address the controversial role of the hot, dry and dusty Saharan Air Layer in tropical storm formation and intensification. Past studies have suggested the layer can both favor and suppress intensification. In addition, HS3 will examine the extent to which deep convection in the inner-core region of storms is a key driver of intensity change or just a response to storms finding favorable sources of energy.JPL's High-Altitude Monolithic Microwave Integrated Circuit Sounding Radiometer (HAMSR) microwave sounder instrument will be one of a set of instruments aboard the Global Hawk that will focus on the inner region of the storms. Most of these instruments represent advanced technology developed by NASA that in some cases are precursors to sensors planned for future NASA satellite missions.HAMSR, an advanced water vapor sensor, analyzes the heat radiation emitted by oxygen and water molecules in the atmosphere to determine their density and temperature. The instrument operates at microwave frequencies that can penetrate clouds, enabling it to determine temperature, humidity and cloud structure under all weather conditions. This capability is critical for studying atmospheric processes associated with bad weather, like the conditions present during hurricanes.For more information, visit:"}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_396", "content": "In 2011 alone, the US was hit by 14 extreme weather events which caused damages exceeding one billion dollars each -- in several states the months of January to October were the wettest ever recorded. Japan also registered record rainfalls, while the Yangtze river basin in China suffered a record drought. Similar record-breaking events occurred also in previous years. In 2010, Western Russia experienced the hottest summer in centuries, while in Pakistan and Australia record-breaking amounts of rain fell. 2003 saw EuropeÂ´s hottest summer in at least half a millennium. And in 2002, the weather station of Zinnwald-Georgenfeld measured more rain in one day than ever before recorded anywhere in Germany -- what followed was the worst flooding of the Elbe river for centuries.\"The question is whether these weather extremes are coincidental or a result of climate change,\" says Dim Coumou, lead author of the article. \"Global warming can generally not be proven to cause individual extreme events -- but in the sum of events the link to climate change becomes clear.\" This is what his analysis of data and published studies shows. \"It is not a question of yes or no, but a question of probabilities,\" Coumou explains. The recent high incidence of weather records is no longer normal, he says.\"ItÂ´s like a game with loaded dice,\" says Coumou. \"A six can appear every now and then, and you never know when it happens. But now it appears much more often, because we have changed the dice.\" The past week illustrates this: between March 13th and 19th alone, historical heat records were exceeded in more than a thousand places in North America.The scientists base their analysis on three pillars: basic physics, statistical analysis and computer simulations. Elementary physical principles already suggest that a warming of the atmosphere leads to more extremes. For example, warm air can hold more moisture until it rains out. Secondly, clear statistical trends can be found in temperature and precipitation data, the scientists explain. And thirdly, detailed computer simulations also confirm the relation between warming and records in both temperature and precipitation.With warmer ocean temperatures, tropical storms -- called typhoons or hurricanes, depending on the region -- should increase in intensity but not in number, according to the current state of knowledge. In the past decade, several record-breaking storms occurred, for example hurricane Wilma in 2004. But the dependencies are complex and not yet fully understood. The observed strong increase in the intensity of tropical storms in the North Atlantic between 1980 and 2005, for example, could be caused not just by surface warming but by a cooling of the upper atmosphere. Furthermore, there are questions about the precision and reliability of historic storm data.Overall, cold extremes decrease with global warming, the scientists found. But this does not compensate for the increase in heat extremes.\"Single weather extremes are often related to regional processes, like a blocking high pressure system or natural phenomena like El NiÃ±o,\" says Stefan Rahmstorf, co-author of the article and chair of the Earth System Analysis department at PIK. \"These are complex processes that we are investigating further. But now these processes unfold against the background of climatic warming. That can turn an extreme event into a record-breaking event.\""}

{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_398", "content": "The researchers report in the journal Nature Climate Change that projected increases in sea level and storm intensity brought on by climate change would make devastating storm surges -- the deadly and destructive mass of water pushed inland by large storms -- more frequent. Using various global climate models, the team developed a simulation tool that can predict the severity of future flooding an area can expect.The researchers used New York City as a test case and found that with fiercer storms and a 3-foot rise in sea level due to climate change, \"100-year floods\" -- a depth of roughly 5.7 feet above tide level that occurs roughly once a century -- could more likely occur every three to 20 years. What today are New York City's \"500-year floods\" -- or waters that reach more than 9 feet deep -- could, with climate change, occur every 25 to 240 years, the researchers wrote.The research is not only the first to examine the future intensity of storm surges, but also to offer a tool for estimating an area's vulnerability, said co-author Michael Oppenheimer, the Albert G. Milbank Professor of Geosciences and International Affairs at Princeton.\"Coastal managers in cities like New York make daily decisions about costly infrastructure that would be affected by such storms. They need a reliable indicator of the risk,\" he said.\"Our modeling approach is designed as a key step in this direction,\" Oppenheimer said. \"As the world warms, risks will increase across a variety of fronts, and the threat to coastal infrastructure in the face of an already-rising sea level and potentially stronger hurricanes could be one of the most costly unless we are able to anticipate and reduce vulnerability.\"Lead author Ning Lin, a postdoctoral fellow at MIT, said that knowing the frequency of storm surges may help urban and coastal planners design seawalls and other protective structures. Lin, who received her Ph.D. from Princeton in 2010, began the project at Princeton then continued it at MIT; the current report is based on her work at MIT.\"When you design your buildings or dams or structures on the coast, you have to know how high your seawall has to be,\" said Lin, noting that Manhattan's seawalls now stand a mere 5 feet high. \"You have to decide whether to build a seawall to prevent being flooded every 20 years.\"Lin and Oppenheimer worked with study co-authors Kerry Emanuel, an MIT atmospheric science professor, and Erik Vanmarcke, a Princeton professor of civil and environmental engineering. Lin, Vanmarcke and Emanuel also co-wrote a 2010 report on the project published in the Journal of Geophysical Research that was based on Lin's work at Princeton.Carol Friedland, an assistant professor of construction management and industrial engineering at Louisiana State University, sees the latest results as a useful tool to inform coastal design -- particularly, she notes, as most buildings are designed with a 60- to 120-year \"usable lifespan.\"\"The physical damage and economic loss that result from storm surge can be devastating to individuals, businesses, infrastructure and communities,\" Friedland said. \"For current coastal community planning and design projects, it is essential that the effects of climate change be included in storm-surge predictions.\"The researchers ran a total of 45,000 storm simulations for the New York City region under two scenarios: current climate conditions from 1981 to 2000 based on observed data and four global climate models; and projected climate conditions for the years 2081 to 2100 based on the four climate models, as well as future carbon dioxide output as predicted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Oppenheimer is a longtime participant in the IPCC.Storms in the simulations occurred within a 125-mile (200-kilometer) radius of the Battery, at the southern tip of Manhattan, and generated a maximum wind speed of at least 50 miles per hour. Hurricanes are classified as having a maximum wind speed of at least 74 miles per hour.Once the researchers simulated storms in the region, they then simulated the resulting storm surges using three different methods, including one used by the National Hurricane Center (NHC). In the days or hours before a hurricane hits land, the NHC uses a storm-surge model to predict the risk and extent of flooding from the impending storm. Such models, however, have not been used to evaluate multiple simulated storms under a scenario of climate change.Again, the group compared results from multiple methods: one from the NHC that simulates storm surges quickly, though coarsely; another method that generates more accurate storm surges, though more slowly; and a method in between, developed by Lin and her colleagues, that estimates relatively accurate surge floods, relatively quickly.The researchers found that the frequency of massive storm surges would go up in proportion to an increase in more violent storms and a rise in sea level, the researchers reported. They noted that climate models predict that the sea level around New York City could rise by 1.5 to nearly 5 feet by the end of the 21st century.Flooding was amplified by the storm's wind direction and proximity to the city. The worst simulated flood, a 15.5-foot storm surge at Manhattan's Battery, stemmed from a high-intensity storm moving northeast and very close to the city. On the other hand, a weaker but larger northwest-bound storm that was further from the city resulted in floodwater nearly 15 feet deep as its strongest winds pushed water toward the Battery.Floods of this magnitude outstrip the most devastating storm surges in the city's recorded history, Lin said. The worst accompanied the 1821 Norfolk and Long Island hurricane, which packed winds of 135 miles per hour and is one of only four hurricanes known to have made landfall in New York City since pre-Columbian times.\"The highest [surge flood] was 3.2 meters [10.4 feet], and this happened in 1821,\" Lin said. \"That's the highest water level observed in New York City's history, which is like a present 500-year event.\"The study was published online Feb. 14 by the journal"}

Greater vulnerability to cyclones is expected to increase global tropical damage to $56 billion by 2100 -- double the current damage -- from the current rate of $26 billion per year if the present climate remains stable.Climate change is predicted to add another $53 billion of damages. The damage caused by climate change is equal to 0.01 percent of GDP in 2100.The United States and China will be hardest hit, incurring $25 billion and $15 billion of the additional damages from climate change, respectively, amounting to 75 percent of the global damages caused by climate change. Small islands, especially in the Caribbean, will also be hit hard, suffering the highest damages per unit of GDP.The research reveals that more intense storms will become more frequent with climate change. \"The biggest storms cause most of the damage,\" said Robert Mendelsohn, the lead economist on the project. \"With the present climate, almost 93 percent of tropical cyclone damage is caused by only 10 percent of the storms. Warming will increase the frequency of these high-intensity storms at least in the North Pacific and North Atlantic Ocean basins, causing most of the increase in damage.\"The authors based their estimates on a future global population of 9 billion and an annual increase of approximately 3 percent in gross world product until 2100. \"More people making a lot more income will put more capital in harm's way,\" he said.Tropical cyclones today cause $26 billion in global damages, which is 4 percent of gross world product. North America and East Asia account for 88 percent of these damages, because these regions have powerful storms and well-developed coastlines.The future economic damage from tropical cyclones will be less than $1 billion a year in Europe and South America because there are few storms there, and the damage in Africa will be low because, Mendelsohn said, there is \"relatively little in harm's way.\" Damages in Asia and Central America are expected to grow rapidly in concert with high economic growth. The Caribbean-Central America region will have the highest damage per unit of gross domestic product -- 37 percent.\"When you calculate damages as a fraction of GDP, island nations are hit disproportionately hard,\" he said.The tropical cyclone model is used in conjunction with climate models to predict how the frequency, intensity and location of tropical cyclones change in the seven ocean basins of the world. The paths of 17,000 synthetic storms are followed until they strike land. The authors used historical data to estimate the damages caused by the intensity of each cyclone and what was in harm's way. The paper revealed that minimum barometric pressure predicts damages more accurately than maximum wind speed."}

The data also showed that strongest convection (rapidly rising air that condenses and forms the thunderstorms that make up the cyclone) is located slightly to the west of the center, because of easterly wind shear. The temperatures of those high cloud tops were colder than -63 Fahrenheit (-51.7 Celsius), which is a threshold scientists use to identify strong thunderstorms with heavy rainfall.

{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_404", "content": "The study's lead author, Christina Paxson of Princeton University, said that the results were a departure from other surveys both in the design and the results. The researchers were able to collect data on the participants before Katrina and nearly five years after the August 2005 storm, finding a persistence of poor mental health and gaining insights into how different types of hurricane-related stressors affect mental health.\"On average, people were not back to baseline mental health and they were showing pretty high levels of post-traumatic stress symptoms. There aren't many studies that trace people for this long, but the very few that there are suggest faster recovery than what we're finding here,\" said Paxson, who is Princeton's Hughes-Rogers Professor of Economics and Public Affairs and dean of the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs. \"I think the lesson for treatment of mental health conditions is don't think it's over after a year. It isn't.\"In addition to helping mental health professionals aid survivors of Hurricane Katrina and other disasters, the research may guide policymakers in addressing areas that had a significant impact on the women in the study, such as home damage and rebuilding.The paper appears in the January issue of the journal The project began in 2003 as a study of low-income adults enrolled in community college around the country, including three sites in New Orleans. The initial questionnaire contained questions about education, income, families and health. After Hurricane Katrina, some of the researchers decided to try to continue to track the New Orleans-based participants.\"I realized right away that the kinds of information we had on mental and physical health were very rare in disaster studies,\" Waters said. \"Researchers never know if people are suffering because of the disaster or if they had underlying conditions that would have led to depression or poor health even before the disaster hit.\"The sample size in the study was made up of 532 low-income mothers, most of whom were African American and whose average age was 26. They were interviewed in two follow-up surveys -- tracked down largely through their unchanged cellphone numbers, though they were spread across 23 states -- about 11 months and nearly five years after the storm.Due to the makeup of the sample, Paxson cautioned that the study's results cannot be assumed to apply to the population as a whole, but they shed light on natural disasters' effects on a particularly vulnerable group.The surveys helped rate the women on two signs of poor mental health: psychological distress and post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS). Researchers measured psychological distress using a series of questions (also in the initial questionnaire) typically used to screen for anxiety and mood disorders, asking about feelings such as sadness, hopelessness and nervousness experienced over the last 30 days. They measured PTSS using a test used to identify individuals at a high risk of meeting the criteria for post-traumatic stress disorder; for example, the women in the study were asked how often they thought about the hurricane in the last seven days and whether they had thoughts about the storm that they could not suppress.The researchers found that even after four years, about 33 percent of the participants still had PTSS, and 30 percent had psychological distress. Though levels for both conditions had declined from the first follow-up 11 months after the hurricane, they were not back to pre-hurricane levels.The researchers had also interviewed the study participants about the types of stressors they had experienced during the storm: home damage, traumatic experiences the week of the hurricane (such as being in danger or lacking food, water or necessary medical care), or death of a friend or relative.Paxson and her collaborators found that these stressors played a role in whether the participants suffered from psychological distress or PTSS, or both. For the most part, the hurricane stressors, especially home damage, were associated with the risk of chronic, long-term PTSS alone or in combination with psychological distress.\"I think Katrina might be different from a lot of natural disasters in the sense that it completely upended most people's lives,\" Paxson said. \"About two-thirds of the sample is back in the New Orleans area, but almost nobody lives in their old home. So they're living in new communities. They've been disrupted from their friends and their families. The whole fabric of their lives has really been changed.\"Demographer Narayan Sastry, a research professor in the Population Studies Center and Survey Research Center at the University of Michigan, said that the study makes an important contribution toward understanding the medium- to long-term effects of Katrina on mental health.\"The most significant aspect was its study of long-term outcomes that were assessed at multiple points in time, including prior to the hurricane -- a unique feature of this study,\" said Sastry, who is familiar with the study but was not involved in it. \"The results are important not just for designing policies and programs to help address any ongoing mental health problems being experienced by survivors of Hurricane Katrina, but also in devising the best response to help people who are affected by natural disasters in the future.\"Sastry added that the study found very similar levels of psychological distress as his work on a broader, representative sample of the pre-hurricane population of New Orleans.Paxson and her collaborators plan to further examine the data from their surveys, and to continue tracking the women in the sample. Some avenues for further study include looking at how genetics may have a played a role in the mental health responses, examining the hurricane's effects on physical health, and tracking the educational and mental health outcomes of the children of the women in the sample. They also plan to publish a book that combines the survey results with in-depth interviews with some of the women.This research was supported by the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, the MacArthur Foundation and Princeton's Griswold Center for Economic Policy Studies."}

{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_406", "content": "The study may also eventually open a window on the question of whether tornadoes are growing more frequent due to long-term climate warming.\"Understanding how climate shapes tornado activity makes forecasts and projections possible and allows us to look into the past and understand what happened,\" said lead author Michael Tippett, a climate scientist at Columbia University's International Research Institute for Climate and Society (IRI).Packing winds of up to 300 miles per hour, tornadoes descend when warm, moist air collides with cold, dry air, creating a vortex as the two masses move around each other. The U.S. Midwest is the twister capital of the world, where cold air blowing east from the Rockies habitually hits tropical air moving north from the Gulf of Mexico. Tornadoes appear to be growing more frequent as climate warms, but it is uncertain whether there is a connection; they are small and hard to count, and recently improved reporting may also explain the increase.Lack of an accurate long-term tornado record makes it hard to know the truth, and has also hampered scientists' ability to relate tornadoes to cyclical weather patterns that could aid in forecasting. While individual hurricanes can be spotted days in advance, tornadoes appear with much less warning. A tornado watch typically gives only a few hours' notice that dangerous conditions are brewing, while warning of an actual tornado bearing down may give people just a few minutes to get out of the way.Tippett, a seasonal forecasting expert, had already built statistical models to understand how climate change might affect hurricanes by adding more heat and moisture to the air. But applying the same methods to something as tiny and complicated as a twister is trickier, said study coauthor Adam Sobel, an atmospheric scientist with joint appointments at Columbia's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory and School of Engineering and Applied Science. \"A tornado is not a lot bigger than the house it has just destroyed,\" he said. \"It's a small thing and short-lived.\"Combing through 30 years of data, Tippett and his colleagues began looking for patterns linking climate and tornadoes. By comparing average atmospheric conditions with average monthly tornado counts in regions across the United States, they identified two parameters that seemed closely associated with monthly tornado activity: rain associated with strong updrafts; and helicity, which measures the tendency of winds to spin those updrafts.They then looked to see if they could \"predict\" the tornado activity of individual months from 1979 to 2010 from a simple index based on each month's average wind and rain parameters. The index correlated significantly with the observed numbers of tornadoes in all months except September and October. Moreover, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) system for making seasonal forecasts, known as the Climate Forecast System (CFS), was able to use the index to forecast monthly tornado activity with some success up to a month in advance. This success, especially notable in June, is the first evidence for the predictability of monthly tornado activity.Harold Brooks, a NOAA tornado expert not involved in the study said the forecast technique worked where others have failed because the CFS produced higher resolution results. \"The real breakthrough is that CFS is skillful enough at the right scale,\" he said.With greater lead time, communities and relief agencies could prepare, he said. \"It's not like the hurricane problem where we can tell people to evacuate. But if I'm a state emergency manager I might be really interested in knowing at the end of March that by the end of April we could have a big problem. You could be better prepared with generators and supplies.\"Tippett said the next steps are to improve the index's reliability in the fall; to better understand why the forecasts work; and to apply the index to projections of future climate. \"Before you can use an index to diagnose future climate, you have to be confident that it explains the observed variability,\" he said.Suzana Camargo, a climate and weather researcher at Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, also coauthored the study, which appears this week in the journal"}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_407", "content": "Their results have been recently published in The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) -- colloquially known as \"Gulf Stream\" -- transports warm surface waters into the high latitudes, where they cool, sink and return southwards at depth as cold North Atlantic Deep Water. Variations in AMOC can significantly affect the northward ocean heat transport and therefore the European and North Atlantic climate. Through its influence on sea surface temperature (SST), AMOC can further impact climate phenomena such as Sahel droughts or the frequency of Atlantic hurricanes. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to be able to predict these climate variations on a time horizon from years to decades. Multi-year climate predictions have so far been limited to predicting surface temperature variations and hurricane frequency, but have not addressed the prediction of any dynamical quantity such as the AMOC.In the near term (inter-annual to decadal timescales), climate variations are influenced by both anthropogenic forcing and natural variability. This is why the near-term climate prediction models must be started (\"initialized\") from the present state of the ocean.The skill of any prediction system is assessed retrospectively, by performing the so-called \"hindcast\" or \"retrospective forecast\" and comparing them with observations. In the present study, ensemble hindcasts have been performed starting in January of each year between 2004 and 2007. The AMOC strength in the hindcasts closely follows the observations for up to four years.The results of the coupled atmosphere-ocean-model ECHAM5/MPI-OM of the MPI-M have been evaluated against the only continuous available observations of the AMOC over the period April 2004 to March 2009. The AMOC observations were and will be performed in the RAPID-MOC project.The close agreement between the hindcasts and the observations has motivated Dr. Daniela Matei and her colleagues to also produce AMOC forecasts (more details on the method in the original publication). An ensemble of nine forecasts spanning 10 years has been constructed for each of the Januaries from 2008 to 2011. For all start years the ensemble mean forecasts until 2014 indicate a generally stable AMOC. However, the forecast initialized in January 2010 shows a pronounced minimum in March 2010. This brief minimum was induced by an extremely negative NAO (North Atlantic Oscillation) during the winter 2009/2010.According to the findings of the working group, the AMOC predictive skill arises predominantly from the basin-wide upper-mid-ocean geostrophic transport. The results of the study demonstrate that the skill of climate prediction arises not only from the large ocean thermal inertia, but also from the long timescales of internal ocean dynamics.The work was supported by the BMBF âNordatlantik II\" project and the Cluster of Excellence \"CliSAP\" (Integrated Climate System Analysis and Prediction) of the University of Hamburg."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_408", "content": "\"Very wet rain events are the trigger,\" said Wdowinski, associate research professor of marine geology and geophysics at the UM Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science. \"The heavy rain induces thousands of landslides and severe erosion, which removes ground material from the Earth's surface, releasing the stress load and encouraging movement along faults.\"Wdowinski and a colleague from Florida International University analyzed data from quakes magnitude-6 and above in Taiwan and Haiti and found a strong temporal relationship between the two natural hazards, where large earthquakes occurred within four years after a very wet tropical cyclone season.During the last 50 years three very wet tropical cyclone events -- Typhoons Morakot, Herb and Flossie -- were followed within four years by major earthquakes in Taiwan's mountainous regions. The 2009 Morakot typhoon was followed by a M-6.2 in 2009 and M-6.4 in 2010. The 1996 Typhoon Herb was followed by M-6.2 in 1998 and M-7.6 in 1999 and the 1969 Typhoon Flossie was followed by a M-6.2 in 1972.The 2010 M-7 earthquake in Haiti occurred in the mountainous region one-and-a-half years after two hurricanes and two tropical storms drenched the island nation within 25 days.The researchers suggest that rain-induced landslides and excess rain carries eroded material downstream. As a result the surface load above the fault is lessened.\"The reduced load unclamp the faults, which can promote an earthquake,\" said Wdowinski.Fractures in Earth's bedrock from the movement of tectonic plates, known as faults, build up stress as they attempt to slide past each other, periodically releasing the stress in the form of an earthquake.According to the scientists, this earthquake-triggering mechanism is only viable on inclined faults, where the rupture by these faults has a significant vertical movement.Wdowinski also shows a trend in the tropical cyclone-earthquake pattern exists in M-5 and above earthquakes. The researchers plan to analyze patterns in other seismically active mountainous regions -- such as the Philippines and Japan -- that are subjected to tropical cyclones activity."}

TRMM provided a \"top down\" rainfall analysis of Tropical Storm Alenga on Dec. 4 at 12:10 UTC (7:10 a.m. EST) using the TRMM Microwave Imager (TMI) and Precipitation Radar (PR) overlaid on an enhanced infrared image from Visible and InfraRed Scanner (VIRS) data. This analysis was done at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. and showed that very heavy rainfall of over 50 mm (~2 inches) per hour was occurring in the forming tropical cyclone near the center of its circulation.Hal Pierce of NASA's TRMM Team at NASA Goddard made the December 4 images from TRMM Data. Pierce said, \"TRMM's Precipitation Radar (PR) data is depicted in a 3-D image that revealed a few powerful storms near the storm's center were pushing up to heights of over 12 km (~7.45 miles). The release of energy within these tall towers are often a sign that a storm is intensifying.\"On Dec. 6 at 4 a.m. EST (0900 UTC), Alenga's maximum sustained winds were near 45 knots (52 mph/83 kmh).

Alenga was moving to the southwest near 2 knots (3 mph/4 kmh).Infrared satellite imagery Dec. 6 showed that the showers and thunderstorms within Alenga are decreasing, and the bands of thunderstorms around its center are weakening. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center noted that this weakening is only temporary as Alenga is forecast to regain strengthen before weakening again two days from now as it becomes an extra-tropical storm.As Alenga continues to head southeast, it is moving into a hostile environment, where wind shear will increase and batter the tropical cyclone, weakening it."}

{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_411", "content": "While the predictions of the paths or tracks of hurricanes, more generally referred to as tropical cyclones (TC), have steadily improved over the last few decades, improvements in the predictions of storm intensity have proven much more difficult.\"Over the past two years, the COAMPS-TC model has shown to be the most accurate emerging research model for predicting tropical cyclone intensity,\" said Dr. Jim Doyle, research meteorologist, NRL Monterey. \"There is no better example of these difficult challenges than the intensity predictions for Hurricane Irene this past August.\"Producing very accurate intensity predictions during a real-time experimental demonstration of Hurricane Irene, COAMPS-TC intensity errors were six knots on average for a series of three-day forecasts, a clear improvement over the official National Hurricane Center (NHC) forecast and other operational models that ranged from 20-30 knots.The successful predictions have demonstrated that Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models can outperform operational statistical-dynamic models that are based on climatology and previous behavior. It is further believed that NWP models, which explicitly predict the location, dynamics and intensity of a storm, will eventually provide the most promising approach to achieve accurate TC intensity and structure prediction.Advancing further methodologies used for vortex initialization, data assimilation and representation of physical processes, COAMPS-TC is expected to become fully-operational in 2013 at the Navy's Fleet Numerical Meteorology and Oceanography Center (FNMOC) in Monterey. Considerable advancements have been made to several components of the modeling system including the data assimilation of conventional and special TC synthetic observations, vortex initialization, and representation of key TC physical processes such as air-sea fluxes, clouds and convection.The COAMPS-TC project will potentially signal a paradigm shift in TC forecasting and is already making a strong impression on the forecasting community. Focusing on the development and transition of a fully coupled air-ocean-wave prediction system, the COAMPS-TC model includes nonhydrostatic atmospheric dynamics, multiple nested moving grids that follow the center of the storm and improved boundary layer and cloud physical parameterizations.COAMPS-TC was first tested in real-time in support of two field campaigns sponsored by the Office of Naval Research (ONR). The Tropical Cyclone Structure-08 (TCS-08) conducted as part of The Observing System Research and Predictability Experiment (THORPEX) Pacific Asian Regional Campaign (T-PARC) in 2008 and the Impact of Typhoons on the Ocean in the Pacific (ITOP) in 2010, both of which took place in the Western Pacific. Additionally, COAMPS-TC advancements and real-time demonstrations in the Eastern Pacific and Western Atlantic have taken place through collaboration with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) as part of the Hurricane Forecast Improvement Project (HFIP) -- a community-wide effort focused on improving operational hurricane prediction.In June 2011, COAMPS-TC was one of nine worldwide winners of the inaugural High Performance Computing (HPC) Excellence Award presented at the ISC-11 International Supercomputing Conference in Hamburg, Germany -- an award presented annually to recognize noteworthy achievements by users of HPC technologies. As a result, COAMPS-TC was recognized for achieving 'a significantly improved model for tropical cyclone forecasting.' COAMPS-TC development benefited significantly from the Department of Defense HPC Modernization Program Office (HPCMO) computational assets at the Navy Defense Supercomputing Resource Center (DSRC) at Mississippi's Stennis Space Center.Increasingly-sophisticated developmental versions of COAMPS-TC will continue to be demonstrated in real-time and in support of the Joint Typhoon Warning Center and the National Hurricane Center. A key additional enhancement will be a fully coupled ocean-atmosphere version in which the NRL Costal Ocean Model (NCOM) and the Wave Watch III (WWIII) will provide the ocean circulation and wave components, respectively."}

The report follows more than two years of research into lessons learned from Hurricane Ike, which made landfall at Galveston Island in September 2008. Ike caused 112 U.S. deaths and is the third-costliest storm in U.S. history, with damages estimated at $30 billion.\"Ike was a Category 2 storm, and Houston and Galveston stand to suffer greater losses from stronger storms, particularly if they hit south of Galveston Bay,\" said Phil Bedient, director of the SSPEED Center and Rice's Herman Brown Professor of Engineering. \"As we studied this, we also met with leaders from industry and government to determine the most realistic and feasible way to protect lives and property from the next big storm.\"Bedient said the study determined that storm-surge flooding could threaten thousands of lives in heavily populated West Galveston Bay communities like Clear Lake and Dickinson. The study also found that refineries and other industry along the Houston Ship Channel was vulnerable to storm surge greater than 15 feet.SSPEED's study began with a 2009 grant from Houston Endowment to investigate how the region had responded to and been impacted by Ike. The endowment also asked for a set of recommendations about how to protect the region from the most devastating effects of future storms.\"In developing our recommendations, we were focused on creating a comprehensive plan that addressed the entire region as well as a realistic plan that would be affordable in today's economy,\" said Jim Blackburn, co-principal investigator on the project and professor in the practice of environmental law at Rice. \"It became obvious pretty quickly that we could only achieve both of those goals with a hybrid set of structural and nonstructural solutions.\"Recommended structural improvements include:Recommended nonstructural improvements include:\"We met with dozens of leaders form both the public and private sectors, and the response has been very positive,\" Bedient said. \"Ike clearly showed that Houston and Galveston are vulnerable. The key to engaging people is focusing on realistic solutions.\"Blackburn said, \"Hurricane-surge flooding is one of the most important issues in our region. We have focused on multiple solutions that can be funded from multiple sources, rather than relying on a single source or a single project. We think that this offers the best chance to develop alternatives that can be implemented in a reasonable amount of time. The time to act is now.\""}

In addition, the next solar maximum is predicted to occur in late 2013 or early 2014, not 2012.Most importantly, however, there simply isn't enough energy in the sun to send a killer fireball 93 million miles to destroy Earth.This is not to say that space weather can't affect our planet. The explosive heat of a solar flare can't make it all the way to our globe, but electromagnetic radiation and energetic particles certainly can. Solar flares can temporarily alter the upper atmosphere creating disruptions with signal transmission from, say, a GPS satellite to Earth causing it to be off by many yards. Another phenomenon produced by the sun could be even more disruptive. Known as a coronal mass ejection (CME), these solar explosions propel bursts of particles and electromagnetic fluctuations into Earth's atmosphere. Those fluctuations could induce electric fluctuations at ground level that could blow out transformers in power grids. The CME's particles can also collide with crucial electronics onboard a satellite and disrupt its systems.In an increasingly technological world, where almost everyone relies on cell phones and GPS controls not just your in-car map system, but also airplane navigation and the extremely accurate clocks that govern financial transactions, space weather is a serious matter.But it is a problem the same way hurricanes are a problem. One can protect oneself with advance information and proper precautions. During a hurricane watch, a homeowner can stay put . . . or he can seal up the house, turn off the electronics and get out of the way. Similarly, scientists at NASA and NOAA give warnings to electric companies, spacecraft operators, and airline pilots before a CME comes to Earth so that these groups can take proper precautions. Improving these predictive abilities the same way weather prediction has improved over the last few decades is one of the reasons NASA studies the sun and space weather. We can't ignore space weather, but we can take appropriate measures to protect ourselves.And, even at their worst, the sun's flares are not physically capable of destroying Earth."}

From Chetumal to Punta Gruesa a tropical storm warning is in effect.As NASA's Terra satellite passed over Hurricane Rina on October 24 at 12:15 p.m. EDT (16:15 UTC) the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument took a visible image of the storm as it nears the Yucatan. The strongest thunderstorms around the center are casting shadows on the surrounding lower clouds. Rina's southwestern edge was over Honduras at this time.On October 25, when NASA's Aqua satellite passed overhead it collected valuable data about Rina's cloud top temperatures. High, cold cloud top temperatures indicate a lot of power in the storm, as strong uplift pushes cloud tops higher in the troposphere, where temperatures drop. The higher and colder the thunderstorms within a hurricane, the stronger they are, and the heavier the rainfall within.When Aqua passed overhead, the infrared data was collected from the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) instrument on the satellite. It showed a large area of strong thunderstorms completely surrounding the center of circulation.Infrared imagery is color coded at NASA. It is created at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. In the image from earlier today, the strongest, coldest, highest cloud tops that surrounded the center of Rina (the eye) were colder than -63 Fahrenheit (-52 Celsius). The eye showed warmer temperatures, indicating that it may be seen on visible satellite data.On October 25 at 11 a.m. EDT, Rina continues to strengthen, as is evident from the AIRS infrared imagery showing powerful convection surrounding the eye of the storm. Rina's maximum sustained winds are now up to 105 mph (165 kmh).Hurricane Rina is closing in on Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula. It is now centered near 17.4 North and 83.9 West, about 300 miles (480 km) east-southeast of Chetumal, Mexico and 305 miles (490 km) southeast of Tulum, Mexico. That's not too far away when you consider that the tropical storm-force winds extend out 115 miles (185 km) from the center. The hurricane-force winds, however are confined to a much smaller area at this time- outward 15 miles (30 km) from the center.The National Hurricane Center (NHC) noted that Rina is crawling to the west-northwest near 3 mph (6 kmh) and is expected to turn to the northwest and speed up a little over the next two days. Rina's center is expected to approach the Mexican coastline in the hurricane warning area by Wednesday night or early Thursday. Tropical storm-force winds are expected in the warning area tomorrow (Oct. 26) afternoon, followed by hurricane-strength winds.Heavy rainfall as seen in NASA AIRS infrared imagery is going to accompany those winds. The NHC is expecting Rina to produce between 8 and 16 inches of rainfall over the eastern Yucatan late Wednesday and early Thursday, as dangerous storm surge hits coastal areas. Storm surge is expected to be as much as 5 to 7 feet above normal tide levels near the track of the storm's center and right of center.NASA AIRS infrared data also shows that Rina is in an area of very warm ocean temperatures, over the 80 degree Fahrenheit (26.6 C) minimum to maintain a tropical cyclone, which will help Rina strengthen over the next day or two."}

The TRMM satellite flew over the forming tropical cyclone on October 23, 2011 at 1728 UTC (1:28 p.m. EDT).Data from TRMM's Microwave Imager (TMI) and Precipitation Radar (PR) was used to create a rainfall image from the TRMM team at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. The rainfall image showed that the future storm already was well organized and had a large area of heavy rainfall extending toward the northeast from eastern Honduras. Up until the morning hours (local time) on Monday, October 24, Honduras had a tropical storm watch in effect for its northeastern coast. That watch was dropped by 10 a.m. EDT as Rina moved away.Today, Oct. 24, that rainfall is affecting the northeastern coast of Honduras and Cayman Islands. The NHC said \"Rina is expected to produce total rain accumulations of 1 to 3 inches along the northeast coast of Honduras. Rainfall amounts of 2 to 4 inches are possible over the Cayman Islands.\"At 11 a.m. EDT on Oct. 24, Rina's maximum sustained winds were near 45 mph (75 kmh). Those tropical storm-force winds extend out 85 miles (140 km) from the center, making Rina a small tropical storm over 170 miles in diameter.Rina is in an environment with warm water (over the 80F/26.6C threshold needed to maintain a tropical cyclone) and low wind shear. It is centered near 17.1 North latitude and 82.9 West longitude, which is about 190 miles (305 km) southwest of Grand Cayman and 370 miles (595 km) east-southeast of Chetumal, Mexico. Rina was moving to the northwest at 6 mph (9 kmh). Minimum central pressure is 1001 millibars.When NASA's Aqua satellite passed over Rina earlier today at 2:47 a.m. EDT the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) instrument took an infrared reading of Rina's cloud top temperatures. The colder the cloud top temperatures, the higher and stronger they are. AIRS temperature data showed a very large area of strong convection and thunderstorms around the center of circulation where cloud top temperatures were colder than -63F (-52C). Those temperatures indicate strong thunderstorms and heavy rainfall. AIRS infrared data showed that Rina continues to become better organized. The AIRS data was created into a color-coded image at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif.There are a couple of factors steering Rina through the Caribbean Sea. In the mid-level of the atmosphere there's a ridge (elongated area) of high pressure building over the northern Gulf of Mexico, which is expected to turn Rina to the west-northwest. The NHC noted that as the ridge moves eastward in a couple of days, it will take Rina northwest, then northward. The NHC expects Rina to become a hurricane tomorrow."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_416", "content": "Tropical cyclones and hurricanes have a massive economic, social and ecological impact, and models of their occurrence influence many planning activities from setting insurance premiums to conservation planning.Understanding how the frequency of hurricanes varies is important for the people that experience them and the ecosystems that are impacted by hurricanes.The findings published in the journal Short intense periods of hurricanes followed by relatively long quiet periods, were found around the Caribbean Sea and the clustering was particularly strong in Florida, the Bahamas, Belize, Honduras, Haiti and Jamaica.Modelling of corals reefs of the Caribbean found that clustered hurricanes are 'better' for coral reef health than random hurricane events as the first hurricane always causes a lot of damage but then those storms that follow in quick succession don't add much additional damage as most of the fragile corals were removed by the first storm.The following prolonged period without hurricanes allows the corals to recover and then remain in a reasonable state prior to being hit by the next series of storms.It is important to consider the clustered nature of hurricane events when predicting the impacts of storms and climate change on ecosystems. For coral reefs, forecasts of habitat collapse were overly pessimistic and have been predicted at least 10 years too early as hurricanes were assumed to occur randomly over time, which is how most research projects model the incidence of future hurricanes.\"Cyclones have always been a natural part of coral reef lifecycles,\" says study author Professor Peter Mumby. \"However, with the additional stresses people have placed upon ecosystems like fishing, pollution and climate change, the impacts of cyclones linger a lot longer than they did in the past.\"Mumby adds: \"If we are to predict the future of coral reefs it's really important to consider the clustering of cyclone events. For a given long term rate of hurricanes (e.g., once per decade), clustered events are less damaging.\"\"Clustering of storms and other weather events is a global phenomenon that needs to be better quantified statistically in risk assessments,\" says study author Professor David Stephenson. \"We didn't at first expect clustering to have advantages but this study has clearly shown that clustering can help by giving ecosystems more time to recover from natural catastrophes.\"Stephenson adds: \"This research also has wider implications for other systems such as the dynamics and viability of insurance companies and the provision of reinsurance protection.\"\"Reinsurance companies are a bit like ecosystems and so need time to recover after major losses -- so clustering of hurricanes allows the industry to build profits before the next cluster of storm losses. They are different from corals in that they actually need a few hurricanes for them to be able to grow,\" said Stephenson."}

The infrared data revealed three areas of strong convection still occurring within the depression. Those three areas had high, very cold cloud tops (-80C/-112F) indicated strong convection, and heavy rainfall.Irwin weakened to a tropical depression early today, Oct. 11, but by 11 a.m. EDT, was back to tropical storm status with maximum sustained winds near 40 mph (65 kmh). Those tropical storm- winds extend out 60 miles from the center, making Irwin a small tropical storm, only 120 miles in diameter.Irwin is centered about 620 miles (1000 km) south-southwest the southern tip of Baja California, Mexico, near 15.3 North and 115.0 West. Irwin is moving to the east at 8 mph (12 kmh) and is expected to continue that direction today, but turn to the east-northeast on Oct. 12.The National Hurricane Center discussion for Irwin's future indicates that the strengthening is only temporary because of stable air and increasing wind shear. If infrared data shows Irwin's cloud tops warming, that means they're falling and there's not as much energy in the atmosphere. If that happens, Irwin may drop to depression status again over the next couple of days."}

A visible image from NOAA's GOES-11 satellite on Oct. 11 at 12:45 p.m. EDT showed Jova's eye \"closed\" (or cloud-filled). The NASA GOES Project and the MODIS Rapid Response Teams are both located at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, and processed those images.In addition to Jova's wink, the infrared AIRS instrument on NASA's Aqua satellite got a cold stare from Jova's eye. Infrared data measures cloud top temperatures, and NASA AIRS instrument noticed they were as cold as -80 Celsius (-112 Fahrenheit) in the thunderstorms in Jova's eyewall. Those frigid cloud top temperatures indicate there's a tremendous amount of power in the storm. The colder the cloud tops, the higher and stronger they are- and Jova is very powerful.Today, dangerous Hurricane Jova continues to slowly approach the southwestern coast of Mexico today. At 11 a.m. EDT today, Oct. 11, it was near 17.8 North and 105.6 West. That's about 120 miles (190 km) southwest of Manzanillo, Mexico, and 180 miles (290 km) south of Cabo Corrientes. Jova's maximum sustained winds were near 115 mph (185 kmh). Jova is moving to the north-northeast at 5 mph (7 kmh). The National Hurricane Center expects Jova to speed up a little and turn to the north tonight. That means that the eye of the hurricane will approach the Mexican coast today and make landfall this evening.Warnings continue to be in effect for Mexico as Jova slowly nears. A Hurricane warning is in effect from Punta San Telmo to Cabo Corrientes. A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect from Lazaro Cardenas to Punta San Telmo and Cabo Corrientes to El Roblito.

{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_419", "content": "Two decades of social science research has reported that people who are more attached to their communities are better off. They are happier, less depressed and physically healthier than those who have weak attachments to their community. It therefore seemed likely that in south Louisiana, a place where people tend to stay for generations, being strongly attached to the local community would help insulate people from the stress related to dealing with the oil spill. But in a study just advance published online in the prominent journal In one of the first publications to present systematically collected public health data on coastal populations affected by the catastrophic oil spill of 2010, LSU sociologists Matthew Lee and Troy Blanchard report that individuals having a stronger sense of attachment to their community exhibited higher self-reported levels of anxiety, worry, nervousness and fear. The data for their study \"Community Attachment and Negative Affective States in the Context of the BP Deepwater Horizon Disaster\" were collected via telephone surveys with more than 900 household respondents in Lafourche, Terrebonne and Plaquemines parishes in coastal Louisiana between June 16 and July 1, 2010, while the oil was still flowing freely.The authors suggest that under normal conditions, attachment to community is a good thing, providing people avenues for social supports and a positive sense of having a place to call home in mass society. Under certain conditions, however, Lee and Blanchard suggest that strong attachments to community actually increase stress and other negative emotional states. This particular situation was unique because the natural resource base was threatened in a region that is heavily dependent economically on having a sound natural resource base. When the resource base is threatened -- for example fisheries being contaminated or closed -- high levels of community attachment often anchor people so strongly to their place of residence that they would be unwilling to move to find another place to make a living.In addition, people who are strongly attached to their communities also tend to know lots of other people in their community who are just like them. They then have not only the personal experience of being stressed, but also end up interacting regularly with other people who are also worried, angry and fearful for their future. This can create a self-reinforcing cycle of stress and anxiety.Based on other research they have been involved in related to Hurricane Katrina, the authors also suggest that community attachment isn't all bad. While initially it is associated with more negative emotions for those in communities affected by disasters like the oil spill, over the long term it is also likely that those people who are most attached are also likely to recover more quickly as time goes by for exactly the same reason: the high degree of social support from neighbors, friends and family their community attachment fosters."}

That convection (rising air that creates the thunderstorms that power a tropical cyclone) was seen in infrared imagery taken early this morning, Oct. 6, from the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) instrument aboard NASA's Aqua satellite. The cold cloud tops from those strong thunderstorms were colder than -63 Fahrenheit (-52 Celsius) and represented the strength in the core of Irwin.At 11 a.m. today, Oct. 6, Tropical Storm Irwin's maximum sustained winds had grown to 40 mph, after forming as a depression just 5 hours before. Irwin was located about 855 miles (1,375 km) south-southwest of the southern tip of Baja California, Mexico near 12.4 North and 116.8 West. It was moving away from land to the west-northwest near 6 mph (9 kmh). The National Hurricane Center expects Irwin to turn to the north and then north-northeast tomorrow. Irwin is expected to strengthen slowly in the next 48 hours. Minimum central pressure was 1005 millibars.Closer to land, NASA's Aqua satellite saw a smaller Tropical Depression 10E. Tropical Depression 10E (TD10E) appears pretty close to Tropical Storm Irwin on the AIRS infrared imagery. It is located to the east-southeast of Tropical Storm Irwin, and it appears to be a smaller, more compact, rounded area of strong convection. Specifically, TD10E is located near 10.3 North and 105.8 West, about 610 miles south of Manzanillo, Mexico. It has maximum sustained winds near 35 mph (55 kmh) and is moving to the west-northwest near 8 mph (13 kmh). The AIRS infrared data shows strong convection around the southwestern edge of the center of circulation, indicating that TD10E could also become a tropical storm shortly.The National Hurricane Center noted that \"The tropical cyclone is forecast to remain over warm waters and in a low (wind) shear environment during the next several days\" and predicts it could become a hurricane in two or three days. By mid-day on Saturday, Oct. 8, the National Hurricane Center forecast projects TD10E to change course and \"recurve ahead of a large trough (elongated area of low pressure) diving southeastward across the southwest United States and the Baja Peninsula.\""}

Storms that develop farther south and/or west in the tropical Atlantic are more likely to become straight moving storms that ultimately affect the Gulf Coast of the United States and the Western Caribbean. However, storms that form more north or east have a greater chance to threaten the Eastern seaboard or simply recurve into the open ocean.Perhaps the most significant finding was that El NiÃ±o seasons are not only associated with fewer storms overall, but those storms that do form are less likely to make landfall due to changes in the atmospheric steering currents.\"In a typical El NiÃ±o season, we found that storms have a higher probability of curving back out into the ocean as opposed to threatening to make landfall along the East Coast of the US due to a change in the circulation across the Atlantic. This is important for not only weather forecasting, but insurance companies, who can use these findings when determining seasonal and yearly quote rates,\" said Colbert.In contrast La NiÃ±a seasons, when the equatorial Pacific Ocean surface is cooler than normal, are associated with both greater numbers of storms as well as an increased likelihood that they will make landfall.\"Growing up in Florida I have always been fascinated not only with hurricanes, but with severe weather in general.

{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_426", "content": "At the Stevens Center for Maritime Systems (CMS), ocean researchers manage a large network of submerged sensors throughout the New York Harbor region, from the South Jersey shore to the eastern end of Long Island and north up the Hudson River. This Urban Ocean Observatory combines real-time and historic data with advanced understanding of ocean physics to make predictions about how tides and other cyclical ocean behaviors influence the potential impact of storms.When it comes to calculating the effects of a coming hurricane, wind speed, size, and location of the storm are only part of the equation.\"We're also looking at lunar activity and erosion as important elements when factoring what we can expect from a storm like Irene,\" says Dr. Alan Blumberg, Director of CMS.Lunar activity is expected to play a large role in influencing the storm's impact on the coast. Irene will arrive at both perigee, when the Moon's elliptical orbit brings it closest to Earth, and the new moon, when the Moon and sun are aligned on the same side of our planet. Both the Moon's position and phase will intensify gravitational effects on the tides, causing greater tidal ranges.Currently, Irene is modeled to travel up the New Jersey coast during during the incoming tide on Sunday. The time of passage is expected to generate significant storm surge impacts along the northern New Jersey Coast before the hurricane makes landfall in western Long Island that evening. Waves with heights over 20 feet are expected on the shelf, generating large breaks on shore and significant beach erosion. For regional beaches, this is a vastly different outlook compared to last year's Hurricane Earl, which stayed further out in the Atlantic and produced long, low waves that probably reversed erosion by pushing sand onto the shore.On Wednesday, August 24, CMS began releasing short statements on Hurricane Irene that describes these latent conditions that can alter the effect of the storm on the region's busy and heavily populated coast.Residents in New York and New Jersey can monitor their waterways during the storm and year-round by visiting the CMS New York Harbor Observing and Prediction System online, but Dr. Blumberg also recommends that anyone in the path of Hurricane Irene consult the National Hurricane Center for the latest information."}

The GOES-13 image shows Irene to be almost one third of the size of the U.S. east coast. The distance from Augusta, Maine to Miami, Florida is 1662.55 miles. Hurricane Irene's tropical storm-force winds extend 255 miles from the center making Irene 510 miles in diameter, almost one-third the size of the U.S. Hurricane-force winds extend 70 miles from the center, or 140 miles in diameter.GOES-13 images and animations are created at NASA's GOES Project at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Md.NASA satellites are providing valuable data to forecasters to assist them in the forecasts for Irene's track and power. As of this morning, a Hurricane Watch is now in effect for the coastal U.S.On Thursday morning, August 24, a hurricane warning is in effect for the central and northwestern Bahamas. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) has also issued the first watch for the U.S. east coast. A hurricane watch is in effect for north of Surf City, North Carolina to the North Carolina-Virginia border including the Pamlico, Albemarle, and Currituck Sounds. A tropical storm watch is in effect for north of Edisto Beach, South Carolina to Surf City North Carolina.NASA satellites are flying above Hurricane Irene, providing forecasters at NHC with temperature, pressure, wind, and cloud and sea surface temperature data. All of those things are critical in helping forecasters determine how Irene will behave and track.The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Instrument aboard NASA's Terra satellite captured a visible image of Hurricane Irene's eye directly over Crooked Island in the southern Bahamas on August 24, 2011 at 18:15 UTC (2:15 p.m. EDT).By 11 a.m. EDT on August 25, Irene had moved north and was 75 miles (105 km) east-northeast of Nassau near 25.9 North latitude and 76.8 West longitude. Irene's winds dropped slightly from 120 mph (195 kmh) to 115 mph (kmh) and it was moving to the north-northwest near 13 mph (20 kmh). The NHC, however, noted that some further strengthening is possible today and tonight.Irene's minimum central pressure has fallen from 954 to 951 millibars since the day before, indicating the storm is still intensifying despite the slight temporary drop in maximum sustained winds.Hurricane-force wind gusts were already reaching Nassau at 8 a.m. EDT. Hurricane force winds are spreading over the northwestern Bahamas this morning and the central Bahamas are still being battered by hurricane or tropical storm force winds, which will diminish later today as Irene moves away.Residents in South Florida are also under warnings for dangerous rip currents and high surf along the eastern shores through Friday, August 26. A tropical storm warning in effect for the offshore marine waters of Palm Beach County, Florida beyond 20 nautical miles, and at 5:30 a.m. EDT this morning, rainbands spreading west over the adjacent Atlantic waters. Numerous showers and thunderstorms are expected along the south Florida coast today and tonight.Far in the eastern Atlantic, Tropical Depression 10 formed about 435 miles (700 km) west-southwest of the southernmost Cape Verde Islands. It was centered near 12.4 North and 30.4 West, and moving to the west-northwest near 13 mph (20 kmh). Tropical Depression 10 (TD10) has maximum sustained winds near 35 mph (55 kmh) and may become a tropical storm in the next day or two. It is not expected to be a threat to the U.S. and is expected to remain at sea.In the meantime, evacuation plans are already under way in North Carolina for the massive Hurricane Irene.Updates on Irene's strength and forecast track can be found at the National Hurricane Center's website:"}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_428", "content": "As one of the nation's most destructive tornado seasons in history begins to wane, and hurricane season approaches its peak, experts are working to determine if old, tried-and-true approaches to residential and small building construction are still adequate, or if it's time to revisit these issues.\"Modern building codes are not what we would call inadequate, but they are kind of a bare minimum,\" said Rakesh Gupta, a professor of wood engineering and mechanics at Oregon State University, and one of the members of the NSF team that traveled to such sites as Tuscaloosa, Ala., and Joplin, Mo. -- where a massive EF5 tornado in May killed more than 150 people and caused damage approaching $3 billion.\"Beyond that, in the actual construction process, buildings are often not built precisely to codes, due to inadequate construction work or code enforcement,\" he said. \"We can do better. The damage didn't have to be as bad as it was. We can design and build structures more rigorously that could withstand wind forces up to 140-150 miles per hour, which would help them better resist both tornadoes and hurricanes.\"In their research, the scientists and engineers found that even in the most catastrophic tornadoes, the path exposed to the most extreme winds is very narrow. In the Joplin example, buildings less than one-half mile away probably faced winds in the 130 mph range, which often destroyed them because they lacked appropriate fasteners, tie-downs, connectors, or adequate number of sheathing nails.\"Another thing we need to consider more in our building practices is the local risks and situation,\" said Arijit Sinha, an OSU professor in the Department of Wood Science and Engineering.\"Just as cities like San Francisco adapt their building codes to consider earthquake risks, many other towns and cities across the nation could be creating local codes to reflect their specific risks from hurricanes, tornadoes, high winds or other concerns,\" Sinha said. \"A national building code may be convenient, but it isn't always the best for every single town in the country.\"Among the findings of the new report:Cost will always be an issue in either new construction or retrofitting of existing structures to better resist these violent storms, the researchers said, but in new construction some of the costs are fairly modest. Thicker plywood sheathing, closer stud spacing such as 12 inches on center, tighter nailing schedules, and more consistent use of inexpensive metal connectors such as \"hurricane ties\" and anchor bolts could accomplish much to improve safety and reduce damage, Gupta said.Retrofitting of existing homes is much more costly, but still something many homeowners should consider, he said. And although tornadoes and hurricanes have different types of impacts on buildings, the wind speeds of a moderate tornado and major hurricane are similar.Even where cities and towns don't have more stringent building codes, Sinha said, individuals can and probably should have their blueprints or structures reviewed by licensed engineers to plan adequately for damage from hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes or other extreme forces.For reasons that are not clear, 2011 has been one of the most destructive tornado years in history, even in regions of the Midwest and South that experience these storms with regularity.One of the largest outbreaks of severe weather in U.S. history occurred on April 27, including a tornado that hit Tuscaloosa County in Alabama, destroying or severely damaging 4,700 homes. The new report was based on lessons learned from that event.The report was done by a study team supported by the National Science Foundation and the International Associations for Wind Engineering that included researchers from OSU, the University of Florida, University of Alabama, Applied Technology Council, South Dakota State University, and private industry."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_429", "content": "In infrared image taken on July 22 at 0845 UTC (4:45 a.m. EDT), GOES-13 captured Tropical Depression Bret, Tropical Storm Cindy in the north Atlantic and low pressure area associated with a tropical wave in the Caribbean and Hurricane Dora is in the eastern Pacific, off the coast of Mexico. Cindy is 910 miles west-northwest of the Azores and Bret 295 miles northwest of Bermuda.NASA's GOES Project issued an infrared image of both Bret and Cindy today from the GOES-13 satellite, which is operated by NOAA. The NASA GOES Project is housed at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. and uses GOES-13 data from NOAA to create images and animations.During the morning of July 22 Bret has sped up on his track through the north Atlantic and weakened. Bret is being battered by winds and cooler waters.Bret was a tropical depression at 8 a.m. EDT on July 22, with maximum sustained winds near 35 mph (55 kmh). He was speeding to the northeast near 21 mph (33 kmh). By noon (EDT) Bret had degenerated into a low pressure area. His center was near 37.7N and 64.2 W, about 375 miles north of Bermuda.Bret is now experiencing very strong wind shear and moving into cooler waters, two factors that will help dissipate the depression over the weekend. Those waters that Bret is moving into are cooler than 71 Fahrenheit (22 Celsius), about 9 degrees cooler than the threshold of warmth needed to keep a tropical cyclone going.As Bret has sped up in his race across the Atlantic, so has his sister Cindy. Cindy is actually out-racing Bret, as she's moving to the northeast near 29 mph (46 kmh) in the far north Atlantic Ocean. She is expected to continue moving in this direction over the weekend. GOES-13 satellite data showed that her cloud pattern has become ragged overnight.She was located about 805 miles northwest of the Azores near 44. 5 North and 39.9 West. Her maximum sustained winds were near 50 mph (85 kmh), so she's stronger than her \"brother\" Bret, who is now down to tropical depression status. Because Cindy is now in very cold water (68F/20C), weakening is forecast and like Bret, she could dissipate over the weekend well to the west of the British Isles.Far to the south of both Bret and Cindy a low pressure area belonging to a tropical wave in the Caribbean is trying to get organized. As of July 22, the National Hurricane Center noted that there's only a 20 percent chance that the low will get its act together over the weekend.The low pressure area is located about 425 miles east of the Windward Islands, near 15 N and 50 W, and is kicking up scattered showers and thunderstorms. It is moving almost as fast as Bret, and is headed west-northwest between 15 and 20 mph. During July 22 and 23, that low pressure area is expected to bring locally heavy rainfall and gusty winds to parts of the Lesser Antilles.Hurricane Dora Weakening Hurricane Dora continues to weaken from northerly wind shear as it moves northwest into cooler waters as cool as 23 Celsius.At 8 a.m. EDT on July 22, Dora has weakened to a category one hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale as it continues to parallel the western coast of Mexico and move in a northwesterly direction about 9 mph (15 kmh). Dora's maximum sustained winds are now near 90 mph (150 kmh). It is centered about 255 miles (415 km) south of Cabo San Lucas, Mexico near 19.2 North and 109.2 West. Minimum central pressure is 977 milibars.There is a tropical storm warning in effect in Mexico from Agua Blanca to Buenavista including Cabo San Lucas. That means that tropical storm conditions exist somewhere in the warning area or will within 24 hours. Tropical Storm-force winds are likely in the warning area as Dora's center stays off the coast, and hurricane-force winds only extend out 35 miles from her center.Southwestern Mexico and Baja California beaches and coastal areas will be hit with large and dangerous ocean swells. These swells will likely cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.By Monday, July 25, Bret and Cindy may be off the books while Dora is expected to last through the weekend. As for the tropical wave in the Atlantic, GOES-13 will keep a close eye on it."}

It can provide hope, even in the midst of great destruction,\" says Dr. Ken Zagacki, co-author of a paper describing the research and a professor of communication at NC State. \"But we have to be careful that we don't use sports to gloss over real problems. We don't want to 'move on' from tragedies like Katrina when real social problems remain.\"In late summer 2005, New Orleans and the Gulf Coast were facing unprecedented destruction stemming from Hurricane Katrina. The region was going through social and economic upheaval. And, in the days immediately following Katrina's landfall, the Louisiana Superdome had been the backdrop for scenes of men, women and children struggling to get basic necessities.In September 2006, the New Orleans Saints played their first home game in that same building, which had just been restored. Zagacki and Dr. Daniel Grano, lead author of the paper and an associate professor at University of North Carolina Charlotte, wanted to see what role that landmark game had in New Orleans' recovery.Louisiana is well known for its passionate football fans, and the Superdome had corresponding cultural importance in the state. As a result, the post-Katrina images of human suffering were particularly traumatic for the region. Those images also raised issues of racism, since the bulk of the citizens stranded there were poor and African American. \"In short,\" Zagacki says, \"an important focal point for the community had become associated with despair, rather than pride.\"But the media coverage of the Saints' homecoming, and the game itself, served as almost a purification ritual for the community. It really helped to reunite the community, giving them a common bond and helping them to move forward.\"However, the media coverage also exacerbated some of the social problems the region was struggling with -- particularly concerning race and poverty.\" For example, television broadcasts and public officials repeatedly associated images of African American evacuees with uncivilized conditions in the Superdome, spreading terrifying rumors that proved mostly untrue.\"The images were intended to highlight the contrast between 'then' and 'now,'\" Zagacki says, \"to illustrate how far New Orleans had come in its recovery. But those same images might have also reinforced negative racial stereotypes.\"The Saints game did serve to help bring the New Orleans community together, giving it a shared sense of identity. However, the researchers say there is some concern that it may also have fostered a false sense of harmony, that forestalled public engagement on issues related to race and class.\"Sports, at any level, can be a powerful unifying force in the wake of a disaster,\" Zagacki says. \"We hope people can utilize that, without losing sight of the larger problems that often need to be dealt with during a community's recovery.\""}

For the past three months, since last year's strong La NiÃ±a event dissipated, data collected by the U.S.-French Ocean Surface Topography Mission (OSTM)/Jason-2 oceanography satellite have shown that the equatorial Pacific sea surface heights have been stable and near average. Elsewhere, however, the northeastern Pacific Ocean remains quite cool, with sea levels much lower than normal. The presence of cool ocean waters off the U.S. West Coast has also been a factor in this year's cool and foggy spring there.The current state of the Pacific is shown in this OSTM/Jason-2 image, based on the average of 10 days of data centered on June 18, 2011. The image depicts places where Pacific sea surface height is higher (warmer) than normal as yellow and red, while places where the sea surface is lower (cooler) than normal are shown in blue and purple. Green indicates near-normal conditions. Sea surface height is an indicator of how much of the sun's heat is stored in the upper ocean.For oceanographers and climate scientists like Patzert, \"La Nada\" conditions can bring with them a high degree of uncertainty. While some forecasters (targeting the next couple of seasons) have suggested La Nada will bring about \"normal\" weather conditions, Patzert cautions previous protracted La Nadas have often delivered unruly jet stream patterns and wild weather swings.In addition, some climatologists are pondering whether a warm El NiÃ±o pattern (which often follows La NiÃ±a) may be lurking over the horizon. Patzert says that would be perfectly fine for the United States.\"For the United States, there would be some positives to the appearance of El NiÃ±o this summer,\" Patzert said. \"The parched and fire-ravaged southern tier of the country would certainly benefit from a good El NiÃ±o soaking. Looking ahead to late August and September, El NiÃ±o would also tend to dampen the 2011 hurricane season in the United States. We've had enough wild and punishing weather this year.

{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_432", "content": "John Harrington Jr., professor of geography, is a synoptic climatologist who examines the factors behind distinctive weather events. He credits the increased tornado production this year to jet stream patterns in the upper atmosphere. The patterns have created synoptic events such as the April tornado outbreak in Alabama and recent tornado in Joplin, Mo. While these events are not unprecedented, they are significant, he said.\"To put them in all in one year, that's what has people talking about this stuff,\" Harrington said. \"The fact that this is happening all in one year and in a relatively short time frame is unusual.\"Special circumstances are necessary for the creation of tornadoes in the Great Plains, Harrington said. A humid atmosphere with moisture from the Gulf of Mexico and the right jet stream pattern coupled with surface convergence help to spawn a thunderstorm. Uplift from the jet stream helps to create the towering clouds associated with severe thunderstorms. Add a wind pattern set up with air filtering into the storm from the south at low levels, from the southwest at mid-levels and the northwest at higher levels, rotation of the thunderstorm cloud begins and its possible for a tornado to form.\"Unfortunately in terms of death and destruction, we've had too many of those events this year,\" Harrington said.Forecasting tornadoes far ahead of time differs from the more advanced hurricane and weather prediction methods. The National Weather Service's Climate Prediction Center does not predict tornadoes, rather it attempts to predict jet stream patterns a month or so in the future.In the wintertime the jet stream tends to flow above the southern United States. It migrates northward by the summertime. The area receiving the most tornadoes tends to shift with jet stream location as well. Oklahoma usually has a higher frequency of tornadoes in April, while Kansas experiences most of its tornadoes in May, Harrington said.Synoptic patterns are different in autumn as the jet stream migrates back south, with much drier air across much of the U.S. While this does not preclude fall tornadoes from occurring, they are rare events. Connecting the surface conditions with the jet stream flow pattern helps a weather forecaster understand the likelihood for severe storms.\"That's pretty important in terms of understanding the kind of environment that will produce the necessary thunderstorms that rotate,\" Harrington said.Extreme examples of weather have not been isolated to tornadoes. Heat waves, blizzards and severe storms have been increasingly more frequent or more severe according to U.S. data, Harrington said. These changes can be attributed to changes in the climate system.The increase in severe weather events is drawing attention, he said.\"We have these good historical precedents for specific synoptic events, but they're starting to come more frequently together. That's what is very interesting, is that this weather system seems to be getting more variable.\""}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_433", "content": "Robyn Tuohy and Christine Stephens of Massey University in Palmerston North, point out that elderly citizens are likely to experience the negative impacts of floods and other natural disasters partly because of age-related disabilities but also because of social circumstances, such as isolation. The team has explored the issues surrounding such vulnerability based on case studies of older adults who experienced a flood disaster and compared those experiences among those living in a rest home or independently in the community.Vulnerability is defined as the ability of a person or group to pre-empt, cope with and recover from a natural disaster, the team explains, determining who is most at risk should ensure better outcomes. Previous studies have suggested that vulnerability is affected by class, gender, ethnicity, socio-economic status (SES) and age, it is also determined to some extent by the type of disaster that occurs. Tuohy and Stephens add that the World Health Organisation (WHO) has identified older adults as a vulnerable population who are more likely to experience greater risks and adversity than others in any disaster.The implications are supported by recent evidence. For instance, research following Hurricane Katrina, which devastated New Orleans in 2005, revealed disproportionately poorer outcomes for older adults compared to other population groups, the Indonesian tsunami of 2004 saw the highest death rates among the over-sixties; deaths during the 2003 Paris heat wave killed more people over 70 years than any other group; and more than half of all casualties in the 1995 Kobe earthquake were older adults, with 90% of deaths in this group.An important aspect of how demographics are developing, the team adds, is that the population is aging so that there is a greater proportion of people over 65 years in many countries. Although many older adults will be cared for in a rest home environment, a greater proportion will be self-reliant and living independently in the community, the team adds. Demographic projections suggest that there will be an almost threefold increase in the global population over 65 within the next half century.\"In a disaster situation, the interaction of personal and social vulnerability will influence the ability of older adults to prepare, respond to and recover from such an event. A disaster will amplify both personal and social challenges facing older adults, and as a result older adults become more vulnerable to experiencing negative outcomes during disasters,\" the team says. \"Emergency preparedness planning must take into account the age-related needs of older adults.\""}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_434", "content": "TRMM is a satellite that is managed by both NASA and the Japanese Space Agency, and monitors rainfall rates in the tropics. It's often used for hurricane research, but also calculates rain rates in other weather systems. On May 22 at 2042 UTC (3:42 p.m. CDT), about two hours before the deadly tornado touched down in Joplin, Missouri, TRMM captured rainfall rates in a supercell thunderstorm that was approaching Joplin from the west. A supercell, also known as a rotating thunderstorm, is a thunderstorm with a deep, continuously-rotating updraft.\"This supercell contained a deadly tornado as it moved into southwestern Missouri a few hours later and hit Joplin, Missouri,\" said Hal Pierce, meteorologist on NASA's TRMM team who created images using TRMM rainfall imagery. TRMM's Microwave Imager (TMI) and Precipitation Radar (PR) were used to create images that showed an analysis of rainfall in the vicinity of the storm. TRMM data revealed a large area of heavy rainfall, where rainfall rates were more than 2 inches (50 millimeters) per hour.Two hours after the TRMM satellite captured that heavy rainfall, the tornado touched down in Joplin with winds up to 198 miles per hour, according to the National Weather Service. As of May 25, 125 people were reported killed, making the twister the most deadly in the U.S. in over 60 years.Southwestern Missouri can't get a break from the severe weather as the recovery efforts continued.

{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_435", "content": "Two feet of heavy rain inundated the Panama Canal watershed between Dec. 7 and 10, 2010. Landslides tore down steep slopes, choking rivers with sediment and overwhelming Panama City's water-treatment plant. Flooding closed the Panama Canal for the first time since 1935. Despite the deluge, the influx of sediments in the water forced authorities to shut down the plant, leaving a million residents of central Panama without clean drinking water for nearly a month.LightHawk, a conservation organization based in the U.S., donates flights for research and conservation efforts. Retired United Airlines captain David Cole flew the Cessna 206 aircraft, and the four flights yielded images of 191 square miles (495 square kilometers) of watershed. Stallard observed numerous new landslide scars left behind by the December storm, supporting his prediction that landslides supplied much of the suspended sediment that disrupted Panama's water supply.The new watershed erosion map will allow Stallard and collaborators from the Panama Canal Authority to calculate the landslide risk of future storms and direct strategies to minimize the effect on Panama's water supply.Tropical hydrologists agree that river-borne sediment originates from surface erosion or from deep erosion from landslides. In 1985, Stallard predicted that \"deep erosion, not shallow surface erosion, is the primary process controlling the chemistry and sediment levels in many tropical rivers that pass through mountainous areas.\" Few studies have been conducted to test this prediction.Deforestation of steep slopes is the primary factor determining the number of landslides. Six decades of aerial photographs analyzed by USGS researchers in similar landscapes in Puerto Rico showed that landslide frequency doubles outside protected nature preserves, and that roads and infrastructure make landslides eight times more likely. Although landslides happen in natural forests, the objective is to limit their impact through appropriate land-use practices.\"With development, landslide intensity increases dramatically,\" said Stallard. \"In its history, the Panama Canal watershed has experienced huge floods. It's still hard to say whether future floods will be accompanied by disastrous landslides like those produced by Hurricane Mitch in Central America.\" In 1998, Hurricane Mitch swept across Honduras, Guatemala, Nicaragua and El Salvador causing more than 10,000 deaths and incalculable economic damage. Panama's proximity to the equator puts the country outside the usual hurricane zone, but prolonged tropical storms may occur.Erosion control is possible. Partnering with the Panama Canal Authority and Panama's Environmental Authority, the Smithsonian is conducting a 700 hectare experiment in the canal watershed funded by the HSBC Climate Partnership to compare the effects of land-use choices, such as cattle ranching or reforestation with native tree species on water supply, carbon storage and biodiversity. Stallard hopes that this research will provide new information about which land uses provide a steady supply of clean water for the Canal.With the first rains in May, the eight-month wet season begins anew in central Panama. Drinking water flows freely, the rivers are clear and the Panama Canal is open for business. But bare slopes of past landslides continue to create secondary erosion, which will dislodge sediments from the steep, rainy and rugged Panama Canal watershed in 2011. The long-term effects of the 2010 storm may continue as renewed interruptions in the water supply in 2011."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_436", "content": "In a survey posed to port authorities around the world, the Stanford team found that most officials are unsure how best to protect their facilities from rising sea levels and more frequent Katrina-magnitude storms, which scientists say could be a consequence of global warming. Results from the survey are published in the journal \"Part of the problem is that science says that by 2100, we'll experience anywhere from 1.5 to 6 feet of sea level rise,\" said the study's lead author, Austin Becker, a graduate student at Stanford. \"That's a huge range.\"Port authorities, like many government agencies and private companies, have to make tough financial decisions when it comes to funding infrastructure, he said. They need accurate information from scientists about what to expect, so that they can plan accordingly. Building a structure to withstand a 6-foot sea level rise would cost much more than trying to accommodate a 1.5-foot rise, said Becker, a doctoral candidate in the Emmett Interdisciplinary Program in Environment and Resources at Stanford.In 2009, Becker distributed 160 surveys to members of the International Association of Ports and Harbors and the American Association of Port Authorities -- the first worldwide survey of port authorities to address climate change adaptation. A total of 93 agencies representing major seaports on every continent, except Antarctica, responded. The majority of respondents ranked sea level rise and increased storm events associated with climate change high on their list of concerns. However, only 6 percent said that they intend to build hurricane barriers within the next 10 years, and fewer than 18 percent had plans to build dikes or other storm protection structures.\"As we saw with Katrina in 2005, storm and flood damage can devastate a regional economy for years after an event and have national impacts,\" said Becker. Katrina, a Category 5 hurricane, caused an estimated $1.7 billion of damage to Louisiana ports. This month, the region is bracing for flood damage once again, as the National Weather Service is predicting that the Mississippi River could crest in New Orleans on May 23.And with scientists forecasting a doubling of Category 4 and 5 hurricanes in the Atlantic Ocean by 2100, it seems all the more imperative to start thinking about adapting port infrastructures now, he said.Threat of violent stormsSea level rise and more frequent violent storms resulting from climate change threaten to take a tremendous toll on all types of infrastructure -- especially along the coasts, said study co-author Martin Fischer, professor of civil and environmental engineering and director of the Center for Integrated Facility Engineering at Stanford.Fischer, Becker and a group of Stanford engineers are developing computer models to help port authorities and other government agencies make more informed decisions about adapting to climate change as they plan for the next generation of infrastructure. The group meets weekly at a seminar that focuses on engineering and policy for a sustainable future. \"Look around at any seaport today and you will see structures that were built 100 years ago,\" said Fischer. \"And the buildings that we are building today will be around when sea level rise begins to reshape the coast.\"The problem on a global scale, he said, is that ports may start scrambling all at once to adapt their structures to changing environmental conditions. \"It could potentially exceed our capacity for construction worldwide,\" he added.Fischer and his colleagues have developed a model that demonstrates how a rapid, simultaneous push to fortify the world's seaports could drive up demand for construction materials and equipment. The model, called Sebastian, uses a Google Earth platform to simulate the costs and time required for building dikes around 200 of the world's most active seaports. Sebastian knows the shape of the ocean floor at each location and tailors the structure to each site to produce an estimate of the materials, labor and equipment that would be needed to fortify the port against sea level rise.\"Sebastian allows us to run different scenarios based on different levels of sea rise, and see how the ports are affected,\" said Fischer. Using criteria in the Army Corps of Engineers manual, the model calculates the resources needed for each variation of the structure. It's a way to calculate big-picture, worldwide demand, Fischer said, but it also gives managers more reliable information about how much survivability they are buying when they invest in different types of protective structures.Lack of oversightAnother difficult challenge in preparing for climate change at seaports is that no single agency or individual has sole authority over any given port, according to Becker. Some ports are privately owned, some are public and some are a mixture of both. And a broad range of entities -- from transportation companies to insurance companies to the Environmental Protection Agency -- have some stake in how they are managed. The arrangement greatly complicates ports' efforts to budget and plan for the future, according to the study.But plan they must, said Fischer.\"By the end of the century, quite a few ports will be in trouble, even if you are using the most conservative estimates for sea level rise,\" he said. \"And if you use the estimates at the top of the range, all of them will be in trouble.\"Other co-authors of the study are Satoshi Inoue of the National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies in Tokyo and Ben Schwegler, a consulting professor of civil and environmental engineering at Stanford and chief scientist at Walt Disney Imagineering.The research was funded by a planning grant from the Sustainable Built Environment Initiative at the Woods Institute for the Environment at Stanford.

{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_437", "content": "\"It's a really critical piece of information that's really going to help society in coastal areas, not only in the U.S., but also globally,\" said atmospheric sciences professor Stephen Nesbitt. Nesbitt and graduate student Daniel Harnos published their findings in the journal Meteorologists have seen large advances in forecasting technology to track the potential path of tropical storms and hurricanes, but they've had little success in predicting storm intensity. One of the biggest forecast problems facing the tropical meteorology community is determining rapid intensification, when storms suddenly transform into much stronger cyclones or hurricanes.\"Rapid intensification means a moderate-strength tropical storm, something that may affect a region but not have a severe impact, blowing up in less than 24 hours to a category 2 or 3 hurricane,\" Harnos said. \"This big, strong storm appears that wasn't anticipated, and the effects are going to be very negative. If you don't have the evacuations in place, people can't prepare for something of the magnitude that's going to come ashore.\"For example, Hurricane Charlie, which hit southern Florida in 2004, was initially forecast as a category 1 storm. However, when it made landfall less than 24 hours later, it had strengthened to a category 4, causing major damage.Rapid intensification is so hard to predict in part because it's driven by internal processes within the storm system, rather than the better-predicted, large-scale winds that determine the direction of the storms. The satellite imagery most commonly used for meteorology only looks at the clouds at the top of the storms, giving little insight as to what's going on inside the system.Harnos and Nesbitt focused their study on passive microwave satellite imagery. Such satellites are used commonly for estimating precipitation, surface temperature and other data. The Illinois researchers were the first to use them systematically to observe hurricane structure and intensity changes.\"What makes it ideal for what we are doing is that it's transparent to clouds. It senses the amount of ice within the clouds, which tells us the strength of convection or the overturn of the atmosphere within the hurricane,\" Nesbitt said. \"It's somewhat like trying to diagnose somebody with a broken arm by taking a picture of the arm, versus being able to X-ray it.\"The researchers scoured data from passive microwave satellites from 1987 to 2008 to see how hurricanes behaved in the 24 hours before a storm underwent rapid intensification. Such a big-picture approach, in contrast to the case studies atmospheric scientists often perform, revealed clear patterns in storm dynamics. They found that, consistently, low-shear storm systems formed a symmetrical ring of thunderstorms around the center of the system about six hours before intensification began. As the system strengthened into a hurricane, the thunderstorms deepened and the ring became even more well-defined.The study also looked at high-shear storms, a less common phenomenon involving atmospheric winds hanging with height.Such storms showed a different structure when intensifying: They form a large, bull's-eye thunderstorm in the center of the system, rather than a ring around the center.\"Now we have an observational tool that uses existing data that can set off a red flag for forecasters, so that when they see this convective ring feature, there's a high probability that a storm may undergo rapid intensification,\" Nesbitt said. \"This is really the first way that we can do this in real time rather than guessing with models or statistical predictions.\"Since passive microwave satellites orbit every three to six hours, meteorologists can use them to track tropical storms and watch for the telltale rings to give forecasters about a 30-hour window before a storm hits its maximum strength.Next, the researchers hope to even further increase their forecasting ability by modeling the internal dynamics of the storm systems as they intensify to pinpoint the causes of the structural changes they observed and find out what drives the intensification process.\"The satellite gives up as snapshot of what's taking place,\" Harnos said. \"We know what's going on, but not how those changes are occurring to end up in the pattern that we're seeing. So what we're working on now is some computer modeling of hurricanes, both real storms and idealized storms, to see dynamically, structurally, what's taking place and what changes are occurring to produce these patterns that we see in the satellite data.\"The NASA Hurricane Science Research Program supported this work."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_438", "content": "Widespread droughts, such as those that occurred in 2002 and 2006, can cut the amount of carbon sequestered by about 20 percent, the scientists concluded in a recent study that was supported by the National Science Foundation and U.S. Department of Energy.The research group -- led by Dr. Jingfeng Xiao, a research assistant  professor at the Complex Systems Research Center, Institute for the  Study of Earth, Oceans, and Space, University of New Hampshire -- included scientists from 35 institutions. Their results, published in the journal \"With this data it appears that our forests and other vegetation can sequester as much as 40 percent of the carbon emissions in the lower 48 states,\" said Beverly Law, a co-author of the study, professor in the Department of Forest Ecosystems and Society at Oregon State University, and science team chair of the AmeriFlux network.\"That's substantially higher than some previous estimates, which indicated these ecosystems could take up the equivalent of only about 30 percent of emissions or less,\" Law said. \"There's still some uncertainty in these data, but it does appear that the terrestrial carbon sink is higher than believed in earlier studies.\"However, the scientists cautioned that major disturbances, such as droughts, wildfires and hurricanes, can all affect the amount of carbon sequestered in a given year. Large droughts that happened twice in the U.S. in the past decade reduced the carbon sink about 20 percent, compared to a normal year.\"With climate change, we may get more extreme or frequent weather events in the future than we had before,\" Law said. \"About half of the United States was affected by the major droughts in 2002 and 2006, which were unusually severe in their spatial extent and severity. And we're now learning that this can have significant effects on the amount of carbon sequestered in a given year.\"Carbon dioxide, when released by the burning of fossil fuels, forest fires, or other activities, is a major \"greenhouse gas\" and factor in global warming. But vegetation, mostly in the form of growing evergreen and deciduous forests, can play an important role in absorbing some of the excess carbon dioxide.Such information is important to understand global climate issues and develop policies, the researchers noted. This study examined the carbon budget in the U.S. from 2001 to 2006. Also playing a key role in the analysis was the PRISM climate database at OSU, a sophisticated system to monitor weather on a very localized and specific basis.The period from 2001-06, the researchers noted, had some catastrophic and unusual events, not the least of which was Hurricane Katrina and the massive destruction it caused. It also factored in the 2002 Biscuit Fire in southwest Oregon, one of the largest forest fires in modern U.S. history.The research found that the temperate forests in the eastern U.S. absorbed carbon mainly because of forest regrowth following the abandonment of agricultural lands, while some areas of the Pacific Northwest assimilated carbon during much of the year because of the region's mild climate.Crop lands were not considered in determining the annual magnitude of the U.S. terrestrial carbon sink, because the carbon they absorb each year during growth will be soon released when the crops are harvested or their biomass burned.\"Our results show that U.S. ecosystems play an important role in slowing down the buildup of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere,\" the researchers wrote in their conclusion. \"The dominant sources of the recent interannual variation included extreme climate events (e.g., drought) and disturbances (e.g., wildfires, hurricanes).\""}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_439", "content": "The study, titled \"Hurricane-Related Exposure Experiences and Stressors, Other Life Events, and Social Support: Concurrent and Prospective Impact on Children's Persistent Posttraumatic Stress Symptoms,\" is published online in the Previous research mainly has focused on children during the few months after a major hurricane, or two years or more after the event. Most of the existing post-hurricane interventions are designed for children experiencing PTS two years or more after the storm. The new study \"picks up where others left off,\" assessing children during the in-between period, at nine months (Time One) and then at 21 months after a hurricane (Time Two), explains La Greca, professor of Psychology and Pediatrics in the college of Arts and Sciences at UM and principal investigator of the study.\"There have been no tested interventions developed for children who still show significant symptoms of PTS almost a year after a devastating hurricane,\" says La Greca. \"What this study shows is that there may be a need to test intervention programs to be used from several months to two years post-disaster, to keep kids from developing persistent stress.\"The researchers studied 384 children, in second to fourth grade that lived through Hurricane Charley, a strong category four hurricane that struck Charlotte County, in Southwest Florida in 2004. The storm caused 35 deaths, extensive damage of more than $16.3 billion and prolonged school closures.According to the study, 35 percent of the children reported moderate to very severe levels of PTS at Time One, and 29 percent were still reporting these levels of stress at Time Two. Although previous studies have shown that children stress symptoms decline the first year after the hurricane, this study shows that children who are still showing signs of stress towards the end of the first year are likely to persist having symptoms another year later.\"It's more common than not for most children to overcome, on their own, the effects of exposure to a severe hurricane,\" says Wendy Silverman,professor of Psychology and Director of the Child Anxiety and Phobia Program at FIU.Florida International University (FIU) and co-author of this study. Our findings that posttraumatic stress symptoms continued in such a high percentage of children almost two years after Hurricane Charley were somewhat unexpected.\"The symptoms the children experience range from reoccurring dreams about the hurricane, to being tense, more distracted, feeling like nobody understands them, more difficulty sleeping, and feeling more sad or fearful than before the disaster. In addition to experiences directly related to the hurricane, other events in the life of a child during the recovery period, such as parents' separation or an illness in the family, have a \"cascading effect\" that magnifies the child's difficulties\"Finding that hurricane related stressors could contribute to other major life events was not necessarily counterintuitive, but, as far as I know, not documented before, and from that perspective, is a significant finding,\" says Silverman.Interestingly, social support from peers was found to be very important in helping to protect the child from the psychological impact of the hurricane. \"For children that have experienced a destructive hurricane, restoring contact with friends provides a buffer to the negative experiences, helping kids have greater resilience and to adjust better to life after the disaster,\" says La Greca."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_440", "content": "One year after the largest and most devastating oil spill in United States history, the magnitude of the impact of the Deepwater Horizon Gulf Oil Spill on human health, the environment, and the economy remains unknown. Along with the 9/11 World Trade Center terrorist attack and Hurricane Katrina, this most recent US catastrophe underscores both the lack of knowledge about long-term effects as well as the need for better plans to improve interventions and services to deal with the consequences of such crises.The article reports what is currently known about the toxicologic consequences of exposures in the Gulf Oil Spill as well as what is known from other spills. However, the authors note the complexity of assessing the full effects of exposures due to the presence of all five elements of a complete exposure pathway, multiple sources of contaminants, and multiple points of exposure. As well, a disproportionately large under-lying disease burden in the population of the Gulf States makes it particularly vulnerable to environmental and natural disasters. The authors report documented symptoms among some 52,000 responders from a number of sources, including self-identified health problems. Additionally, vulnerability to heat stress in the high summer temperatures in the Gulf compounded by personal protective equipment also contributed to health risks, particularly among inexperienced volunteers.Of particular concern are the mental health symptoms among response workers and community members after oil disasters. Calls to mental health and domestic violence hotlines in the Gulf area have increased since the oil spill, in keeping with reports of increased domestic violence, mental illness, and substance abuse after other disasters.\"Many communities affected by the Gulf oil spill were still recovering form Hurricane Katrina at the time of the Gulf oil spill, which increased the complexity of the response,\" notes Dr. Osofsky. \"We found that 48% of students returning to schools in New Orleans, St. Bernard, and Plaquemines parishes had mental health symptoms in 2005-06. In 2009-10, before the oil spill, 30% continued to have symptoms, suggesting that a complex or repeated trauma increases vulnerability to mental health conditions.\"The authors recommend a number of steps be taken now -- rapid development and implementation of protocols for baseline clinical evaluations, including respiratory functions; biospecimen banking; short and long-term medical surveillance and monitoring of workers; and development of psychosocial interventions. In addition to research, clinical and referral networks addressing immediate physical and mental health symptoms and untreated existing health conditions such as asthma and hypertension are critical, they conclude, especially for vulnerable populations.Authors include Bernard Goldstein at the University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of Public Health and Tulane University's Maureen Lichtveld, MD, MPH."}

{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_442", "content": "Researchers found that that the poorest inhabitants of a small village in northeastern Honduras increased their land wealth and their share of earnings relative to more wealthy residents after Hurricane Mitch devastated their village in October 1998.The findings offer a glimmer of hope from widespread concerns that the world's poor will suffer the most from shocks created by global climate change.\"In the face of climate shocks, the fate of the poorest is not sealed,\" said Kendra McSweeney, co-author of the study and associate professor of geography at Ohio State University.\"Our study suggests that alternate outcomes are at least possible, and there may be ways for the poor to improve their situations if they are given the opportunity to come up with their own solutions.\"The key for the people in this study was that, without outside interference, they were able to come up with a new method for how residents could own land -- a necessity for survival in this rural, agriculture-based community, McSweeney said.McSweeney wrote the study with Oliver Coomes of McGill University in Montreal, Canada. Their study appears in the online Early Edition of the The study is based on observations made by McSweeney before and after Mitch in Krausirpi, a small community of about 600 indigenous people called the Tawahka. She began her work in the community in 1994 -- four years before Hurricane Mitch -- and continued until 2002.The town is situated along the Patuca River, about 100 kilometers due south of Honduras' coast, and it was devastated by the hurricane.Many of the town's residents made a large proportion of their living from agriculture on the nearby floodplains and upland fields. But the hurricane destroyed 95 percent of the floodplain's 125 acres of cacao orchards, effectively ending this key source of income for the residents. The storm also extensively damaged the upland manioc and banana/plantain crops, as well as the rice crop.In order to compare how residents fared after the hurricane, the researchers separated the population into thirds, based on the amount of land they owed. They found that the land-poorest third of the residents -- half of which were headed by single women -- lost 59 percent of their land to the hurricane, compared to just 36 percent land loss suffered by the land-richest third of the residents.But while the poorest were hit hardest by the hurricane, they actually showed a remarkable rebound in the years following, McSweeney said.By 2002, the households in the study had not only recouped their hurricane-caused losses, but tripled their average holdings, from 13 hectares to 42 hectares. Households that owned the most land before Mitch gained the most back by 2002.But the households who were the land-poorest before Mitch had a greater relative gain -- a 296 percent increase in land held from 1998 to 2002. Overall the total land held by the formerly land-poor doubled by 2002, the results showed.\"Land in the community actually became more equitably distributed after the hurricane, McSweeney said.In addition, the land-poorest households also captured a greater share of the community's income after the hurricane. Overall, incomes declined in the community after the hurricane but, surprisingly, the cash earnings of the land-poorest households actually held steady between 1998 and 2001.The result was that the poorest saw their share of the community's aggregate income increase from 18 percent to 41 percent over that time.Much of that income increase came because the poorest residents increased the amount of money they received from local salary or wage work. Many poor residents accepted positions with the forestry service and other organizations involved in post-Mitch cleanup or management of a local biosphere reserve.The young people who made up most of the area's poor were most likely to speak Spanish and were less likely to have family members at home they had to care for, which made them ideal for many of the jobs that opened up after the hurricane.But the key to the comeback of the poorest residents was a subtle change in how people could claim land as their own, the researchers found.Before the hurricane, people could claim land from the nearby forests only after they cleared it and began using it for crops. That favored the rich, since they could hire people to clear land and plant crops.The poor, on the other hand, could not pay people to clear land and didn't have time to spend on work that didn't provide money.But after the hurricane, some residents began roping off areas of the forest and claiming it as their own without clearing it. Some of the money they earned on reconstruction efforts was used to hire people to clear parts of their land, as needed for crops. But they felt secure that they had the land they claimed, even if it was not all cleared.\"It was a tiny shift in thinking about how you owned land. But the ramifications were extraordinary,\" McSweeney said.\"No outsiders or even Tawahka leadership even were aware of what was happening. There was no group decision. One person claimed land, and then a neighbor did. The solution took off virally within the community. It was a ground-up solution to a problem that ended up helping everyone.\"McSweeney said what happened in this community goes against what many experts believe happens in a disaster, at least in poor, mostly rural areas.\"We expect that elites will dominate, that they will use the disaster to their own advantage. The reason that didn't happen here is that the poor found a solution in their own quiet way, and it was a done deal by the time the elite had found out.\"McSweeney said one of the surprising aspects of what happened is that the people themselves didn't really think what they were doing was revolutionary in any way. They just saw a problem and found a way to solve it.The value of the changes in their way of life became clear in 2008, when tropical storms created flooding in the community that was as bad as that caused by Hurricane Mitch. But when residents were interviewed later, they reported that they bounced back quickly, McSweeney said.In many ways, what happened in Krausirpi is unique. But there are still generalizable lessons for the rest of the world, McSweeney said.\"In the face of climate-related disasters, do not discount local people's ability to sort things out on their own. That doesn't mean they don't need help, but they need the time and space to figure out solutions that work best for them,\" she said.The Tawahka people in this study were helped by the fact that outsiders helped provide them with jobs, but didn't interfere in how land was used in the community. That gave residents the space they needed to create their own solutions.\"It is not helpful to think of the poor only as vulnerable victims of climate change. They show real resilience that can help them survive in the face of challenges,\" McSweeney said.The research was supported by grants from McGill University, Fonds pour la Formation de Chercheurs et l'Aide Ã  la Recherche (QuÃ©bec), an International Development Research Centre Young Researchers Award (Canada), a McColl Family Fellowship from the American Geographical Society, a Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada Postdoctoral Fellowship, and Ohio State."}

Rose, a professor with the USC School of Policy, Planning, and Development, also is the coordinator for economics at the Center for Risk and Economic Analysis of Terrorism Events (CREATE) at USC.That number would make the severe storm scenario \"the costliest disaster in the history of the United StatesÌ¶, Rose said, more than six times greater than the 2001 World Trade Center attacks and Hurricane Katrina, which each caused $100 billion in business interruption.The storm simulation U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) scientists termed \"ARkStorm -- or \"atmospheric river storm\" -- is patterned after the U.S. West Coast storms that devastated California in 1861-62.The storms lasted for 45 days, forming lakes in the Mojave Desert and the Los Angeles Basin. California was left bankrupt after the storms wiped out nearly a third of the state's taxable land, according to the USGS.But those storms were no freak event, said USGS scientists, who called the ARkStorm model \"plausible, perhaps inevitable.\"The ARkStorm areas include Orange County, Los Angeles County, San Diego and the San Francisco Bay area. The megastorm likely would require the evacuation of 1.5 million people.According to the USGS, the ARkStorm would:Rose estimated the ARkStorm would cause the state's unemployment rate to jump six percentage points in the first year, a further blow to the California economy that currently has one of the highest unemployment rates in the nation at 12.4 percent.Rose called the severe storm scenario \"much more imaginable\" after Los Angeles was hit with 9.42 inches of rain in December. It was the wettest December in downtown Los Angeles in more than a century.Climate scientists said global warming is a major factor behind the increasingly destructive power of hurricanes and other storms.The sea level is rising as oceans warm and glaciers melt, which can create higher storm surges and more disastrous flooding in coastal areas.\"Climate change affects how the whole ecosystem works,\" said Mark Bernstein, managing director of The USC Energy Institute.\"Storms form based on how warm the oceans are and how the jet stream changes,\" Bernstein said. \"The consequence is [the rain] will come in shorter and more intense bursts.\"Businesses and local governments can minimize the long-term impacts of such a disaster, Rose said, by creating emergency plans, increasing inventories of critical materials, backing up information systems, and diversifying supply chains and routes."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_444", "content": "While atmospheric rivers are responsible for great quantities of rain that can produce flooding, they also contribute to beneficial increases in snowpack. A series of atmospheric rivers fueled the strong winter storms that battered the U.S. West Coast from western Washington to Southern California from Dec. 10 to 22, 2010, producing 28 to 64 centimeters (11 to 25 inches) of rain in certain areas. The atmospheric rivers also contributed to the snowpack in the Sierras, which received 75 percent of its annual snow by Dec. 22, the first full day of winter.To improve our understanding of how atmospheric rivers form and behave and evaluate the operational use of unmanned aircraft for investigating these phenomena, NASA scientists, aircraft and sensors will participate in a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration-led airborne field campaign slated to begin Feb. 11.Called Winter Storms and Pacific Atmospheric Rivers, or WISPAR, the field campaign, which continues through the end of February, is designed to demonstrate new technology, contribute to our understanding of atmospheric rivers and assist NOAA in potentially conducting offshore monitoring of atmospheric rivers to aid in future weather predictions.A NASA Global Hawk unmanned aircraft operated out of NASA's Dryden Flight Research Center in Southern California is scheduled to depart Dryden Friday morning, Feb. 11, on the campaign's first science flight. The 24-hour flight will study an atmospheric river currently developing in the Pacific Ocean off Hawaii that appears as though it will impact the Oregon-California coast this weekend. Aboard the Global Hawk will be new weather reconnaissance devices called dropsondes developed by the National Center for Atmospheric Research that will take temperature, wind and other readings as they descend through an atmospheric river. Also aboard will be an advanced water vapor sensor -- the High-Altitude Monolithic Microwave Integrated Circuit Sounding Radiometer, or HAMSR -- created by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif.The remote-sensing HAMSR instrument analyzes the heat radiation emitted by oxygen and water molecules in the atmosphere to determine their density and temperature. The instrument operates at microwave frequencies that can penetrate clouds, enabling it to determine temperature, humidity and cloud structure under all weather conditions. This capability is critical for studying atmospheric processes associated with bad weather, like the conditions present during atmospheric river events.HAMSR Principal Investigator Bjorn Lambrigtsen of JPL says the instrument -- the most accurate and sensitive of its kind in the world -- will help scientists better understand these unique weather phenomena.\"The WISPAR campaign is intended to study the concentrated streams of tropical moisture that sometimes get connected with cold fronts and winter storms approaching the U.S. West Coast -- sometimes called the pineapple express, since they often originate near Hawaii -- which can result in very intense rain events,\" Lambrigtsen said. \"HAMSR, flying on NASA's unpiloted Global Hawk well above the weather but close enough to get a much more detailed picture than is possible from a satellite, will be used to map out this phenomenon and answer scientific questions about the formation and structure of these systems.\"NASA's Global Hawk is an ideal platform from which to conduct WISPAR science because it is able to fly long distances, stay aloft for more than 24 hours and travel at high and low altitudes that could be dangerous for humans. Lambrigtsen will be at Dryden in the Global Hawk Operations Center during the flights, using data from the sensor and other information to adjust the Global Hawk's flight track, as necessary, to optimize the sampling of the atmospheric rivers.Lambrigtsen said the public can monitor the progress of the WISPAR science flights in real time on a WISPAR version of JPL's hurricane portal website at For more information about WISPAR, visit:"}

{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_446", "content": "But a University of South Carolina geographer has reconstructed the storm, using maritime records, and has uncovered new information about its intensity, how it was formed and the track it took.Dr. Cary Mock's account of the \"Great Louisiana Hurricane of 1812\" appears in the current issue of the \"It was a lost event, dwarfed by history itself,\" said Mock, an associate professor in the College of Arts and Sciences. \"Louisiana was just in possession by the United States at the time, having been purchased from France only years before, and was isolated from the press.\"Mock says historians have long known that a hurricane hit New Orleans on Aug. 19, 1812, but they didn't know the meteorological details about the storm.\"Hurricane Katrina is not the worst-case scenario for New Orleans, as its strongest winds were over water east of the eye,\" said Mock. \"The 1812 hurricane was the closest to the city, passing just to the west. It wasn't as big as Katrina, but it was stronger at landfall, probably a mid-three or four category hurricane in terms of winds.\"Detailed information about past hurricanes is critical to helping climatologists today forecast and track hurricanes. But until recently, little was known of hurricanes that occurred before the late 19th century, when weather instrumentation and record keeping became more sophisticated and standardized. Mock's research has shed light on much of the nation's hurricane history that has remained hidden for centuries.\"A hurricane like the one in August 1812 would rank among the worst Louisiana hurricanes in dollar damage if it occurred today,\" said Mock. \"Hurricane Betsey was 100 miles to the west. Katrina was to the east. A 1915 hurricane came from the South. By knowing the track and intensity, as well as storm surge, of the August 1812 hurricane, we have another worst-case-scenario benchmark for hurricanes. If a hurricane like it happened today -- and it could happen -- it would mean absolute devastation.\"Mock has spent the last decade conducting research and creating a history of hurricanes and severe weather of the Eastern U.S. that dates back hundreds of years. Using newspapers, plantation records, diaries and ship logs, he has created a database that gives scientists the longitudinal data they've lacked. His research has been funded by nearly $700,000 in grants from the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).Mock began researching the August 1812 hurricane along with other early Louisiana hurricanes in 2006. It took 18 months for him to reconstruct the 1812 storm's complete track.Newspaper accounts, which included five from Louisiana and 17 from other states, described hourly timing of the storm's impact, wind direction and intensity, rainfall, tide height and damage to trees and buildings.The Orleans Gazette description of the impact of storm surge on the levees is one example:\"The levee almost entirely destroyed; the beach covered from fragments of vessels, merchandize, trunks, and here and there the eye falling on a mangled corpse. In short, what a few hours before was life and property, presented to the astonished spectator only death and ruin,\" reported the newspaper.The environmental conditions of the Louisiana coast were different in 1812; the sea level was lower, elevation of the city was higher and the expanse of the wetlands far greater. These conditions would have reduced the storm surge by at least several feet, says Mock.Some of the most valuable sources to Mock's research were maritime records, which include ship logbooks and ship protests, records submitted by ship captains to notaries detailing damage sustained to goods as a result of weather. Ship logs, kept hour by hour, include data about wind scale, wind direction and barometric pressure.Because of the war, England bolstered its naval presence, providing Mock, the first academic researcher to conduct historical maritime climate research, with a bounty of records to help him recreate the storm's path and intensity.\"The British Royal Navy enforced a blockade of American ports during the War of 1812,\" said Mock. \"The logbooks for ships located in the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea had all sorts of valuable information.\"In addition to 12 British Navy logbooks, he was able to use information from logbooks of the USS Enterprise and another from an American merchant vessel. Ship protest records from the New Orleans Notarial Archives provided Mock with some surprising contributions.\"I was initially pretty pessimistic on what I would find in the ship protests,\" said Mock. \"I thought I'd find a few scraps and be in and out in two days. I was wrong. I found a trove of material and ended up going back eight times.\"Archivists presented Mock with upwards of 100 books for every year, each 800 pages in length and none indexed with the word hurricane. After scouring the records, Mock uncovered nearly 50 useful items related to the 1812 hurricane, including accounts from the schooner, Rebecca, which described the storm in the middle of the Gulf of Mexico in a protest that was filed with notary Marc Lafitte.It described a 4 p.m. heavy gale that increased to a perfect hurricane wind, with the shifting of winds by noon the next day. The shift of winds from the northeast to the northwest told Mock that the storm track passed to the east of the Rebecca.Using the logs and protests, Mock was able to correlate the precise location of ships with the hourly weather and create a map of the storm's path through the Gulf of Mexico.\"Its initial approach was toward Mississippi, but then it turned northwest toward Louisiana as it approached landfall in the afternoon on Aug. 19,\" Mock said. \"The USS Enterprise had the most detailed wind observations at New Orleans. A change in winds to the southwest around local midnight tells me that the storm center skimmed as little as five kilometers to the west of New Orleans.\"To further understand the hurricane's formation and dissipation, Mock reviewed records stretching as far north as Ohio and east to South Carolina. Included among them were meteorological records by James Kershaw in Camden, S.C., which are part of the collections of USC's South Caroliniana Library.\"I wanted to collect data from a wide area to understand the weather patterns, pressure systems and the very nature of the 1812 hurricane,\" said Mock. \"A better understanding of hurricanes of the past for a wide area provides a better understanding of hurricane formation and their tracks in the future.\""}

The eye of the cyclone was very clear and indicative of the power of this tropical cyclone. Damaged buildings, downed trees and power outages have been reported.A Cyclone Warning is still in effect today for coastal and island communities from Cooktown to Proserpine, and west inland to the Northern Territory border. The Cyclone Warning was cancelled between Cape Flattery and Cooktown. The Australian Bureau of meteorology warned that flooding rains between Cairns and Proserpine will gradually move inland as Yasi tracks to the west. Flood Warnings are in effect for several rivers between Cairns and MacKayAt 03:29 UTC/1:29 p.m. Australia local time on February 2 (10:29 p.m. EST, Feb. 1), the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) instrument captured an infrared image of Cyclone Yasi as its center was just southeast of Willis Island. The infrared image showed powerful thunderstorms with strong convection and heavy rainfall surrounding a large area around a very clear eye. The temperatures in the cloud tops were as cold as or colder than -63 Fahrenheit (-52 Celsius).Tropical Cyclone Yasi was making landfall as a powerful Category Four cyclone with maximum sustained winds near 135 knots (155 mph/ 250 kmh) on Feb. 2, at 1500 UTC (10 a.m. EST/ 1 a.m. Australia local time on Feb. 3). It was located about 245 miles east of Cairns near 17.5 South and 146.8 East and moving west-southwest near 13 knots (15 mph/ 24 kmh). Maximum waveheights associated with Yasi were 42 feet (~13 meters) in the Coral Sea.The automated Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) weather station on Willis Island provided amazing data this morning as Cyclone Yasi swept past. Willis Island is located east of Queensland, Australia. Rainfall exceeded 60 mm (2.36 inches) in one hour and pressure had fallen to near 938 millibars. Windspeed peaked at 75 knots (86 mph/138 kmh) before the equipment stopped working.As Yasi made landfall and swept inland, Cairns, located to the north of Townsville, recorded a low reading of atmospheric pressure near 983 millibars. Rainfall was 16 mm (0.6 inch) in one hour, and maximum sustained winds were recorded as high as 34 knots (39 mph/63 kmh).At 3 a.m. local time, the center of Severe Tropical Cyclone Yasi had moved inland and was located near 18.1 South and 145.4 East. It was moving west-southwest near 33 kmh (20 mph) and had a minimum central pressure of 941 millibars. The storm is forecast to weaken and dissipate within 48 hours."}

{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_450", "content": "\"The speed with which the drought developed across the southern United States is rather unusual considering that just last year El NiÃ±o dominated the region with abundant precipitation,\" said Bill Proenza, director of NOAA's National Weather Service southern region.\" Then it was as if a switch was flipped during the summer, changing to La NiÃ±a conditions.\"One of the major aspects of the emergence of La NiÃ±a was a very busy Atlantic hurricane season, which spawned 19 tropical storms, making it the third most active on record. Despite the large number of storms, only Hurricane Alex and Tropical Storm Hermine produced any appreciable rainfall in the southern United States. Those storms only affected Texas; no significant rainfall from an organized tropical system fell along the Gulf Coast from Louisiana to Florida.Sparse tropical rainfall and the dry conditions associated with La NiÃ±a combined to create severe to extreme drought conditions for nearly a third of the South and Southeast by late fall and early winter.While the drought touches all of the Gulf Coast states, Texas and Florida are the most affected. From October through December, Texas received only five to 50 percent of normal precipitation, with portions of the lower Rio Grande averaging less than five percent of normal. During that period, for example, Brownsville received only 0.14 inches (normal is 6.55 inches) and Del Rio received 0.04 inch (normal is 3.89 inches). To the north in Austin, only 1.55 inches of rainfall was observed, compared to the normal of 8.34 inches.In Florida, 51 percent of the state was in severe to extreme drought by the end of 2010. Some areas experienced the driest July 1 -- December 31 period on record. For example, Gainesville received only 12.95 inches of precipitation, compared to the previous record low of 15.25 inches. The city normally receives 27 inches. Daytona Beach ended the period with 14.71 inches compared to the previous record low of 15.35 inches â its normal is 30 inches.In central and southern Florida, the South Florida Water Management District rain gauge network recorded an average of only 2.97 inches during the October through December period, breaking the previous record low average of 4.07 inches. Moreover, the District reports that Florida's Lake Okeechobee ended the year at 12.4 feet, 2.3 feet below average.In addition to agricultural and water conservation concerns, one of the major threats from the drought is the growing wildfire danger. More than 42,000 fires accounted for more than 775,000 acres burned throughout the affected southern tier states during 2010.Texas and Florida were among the hardest hit states. In Texas, the severe wildfire threat prompted Governor Rick Perry to issue a disaster proclamation for 244 of the state's 254 counties. Meanwhile, Florida lost more than 400,000 acres to wildfires last year, with more predicted to come. Florida's Forestry Division notes La NiÃ±a is expected to continue at least through spring and again anticipates greater than normal wildfire activity in 2011.Getting the word out regarding likely La NiÃ±a impacts is imperative. \"By providing information on current and future climate conditions to the public and to other federal, state and local decision makers, the National Weather Service can help them prepare for and react to such extreme weather events and to climate variability,\" said David Brown, Ph.D., regional climate services director for NOAA's National Weather Service southern region.La NiÃ±a has developed 13 times since 1950, and the current La NiÃ±a ranks as the sixth strongest. The question climate experts are asking now is whether it will fade with the approach of summer or continue into next year.\"Of the five stronger La NiÃ±as that occurred, four resulted in multi-year events,\" said Victor Murphy, climate program manager for NOAA's National Weather Service southern region. \"If this La NiÃ±a persists until next winter, the threat of drought conditions in the south extending into next year will be heightened.\""}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_451", "content": "The Differential Absorption Barometric Radar (DIABAR) prototype is scheduled to make its second flight early this year.DIABAR remotely senses barometric pressure at sea level, which is important in the prediction and forecasting of severe weather, especially hurricanes, over oceans.But the ability to measure sea-level air pressure is a major missing link in storm observation, says Dr. Bing Lin, an atmospheric scientist at NASA Langley Research Center in Hampton, Va.\"Air pressure is a driving force of weather systems, especially under severe weather conditions like hurricanes,\" he said. \"For severe storms, the forecasts of the intensity and track can be significantly improved by pressure measurements.\"A hurricane begins as a tropical wave, a westward-moving area of low air pressure. As warm, moist air over the ocean rises in the low air-pressure area, surrounding air replaces it, and circulation forms. This produces strong gusty winds, heavy rain and thunderclouds -- a tropical disturbance.As air pressure drops and winds sustain at 38 mph or more, the disturbance becomes a tropical depression, then a tropical storm, and finally a hurricane with sustained winds of over 73 mph.Lin hopes eventually to be able to measure sea-level air pressure from aircraft flyovers and space-based satellites. The local coverage provide by flyovers, combined with a broad perspective from space, will provide enough information to significantly improve the ability of forecasters to determine how intense a hurricane is and where it's headed.\"Large and frequent sea surface measurements are critically needed,\" he said. \"These measurements cannot be made from buoys and aircraft dropsondes. The only hope is from remote sensing using aircraft, unmanned aerial vehicles, and satellites.\"An effort to remotely sense barometric pressure at sea-surface level using microwaves was undertaken at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., in the 1980s. \"JPL has extensive experience on spaceborne microwave sensors,\" said Lin.DIABAR was first deployed on a Navy MH-60S helicopter in 2009 at Naval Air Station Patuxent River in Maryland.\"We flew it, got the results, and it looks great,\" said Lin.The next step is testing this year on a blimp called the Bulletâ¢ Class 580, the world's largest airship. E-Green Technologies Inc. in Alabama makes the aircraft.The 235-foot long, 65-foot diameter lighter-than-air vehicle is designed to fly on algae-based biofuel at speeds up to 74 mph and altitudes up to 20,000 feet. It will be stationed in a hanger at Moffett Federal Airfield at NASA Ames Research Center in California.DIABAR is a partnership between NASA Langley, Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Va., and the State University of New York at Albany."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_452", "content": "While the 2010 hurricane season has been a rather quiet one for coastal dwellers, the churning meteorology of the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea seemed to cooperate well with the science goals of Genesis and Rapid Intensification Processes (GRIP) experiment. Those goals were designed to answer some of the most fundamental yet still unanswered questions of hurricane science: What ultimately causes hurricanes to form? Why do some tropical depressions become strong hurricanes, while others dissipate? What causes the rapid strengthening often seen in hurricanes?Mission scientists wanted to capture data on hurricanes as they formed and intensified. Ideally, the NASA planes -- the DC-8, WB-57 and Global Hawk -- would also fly over systems that were weakening, or that were expected to form into hurricanes yet did not. When the flights had ended, all those goals had been met.\"It was successful beyond my reasonable expectations. It requires cooperation with the weather, and good luck with the aircraft,\" said mission scientist Ed Zipser, of the University of Utah. \"It's not so much a logistical challenge as it is a toss of the dice by Mother Nature during our time available. But it takes a good airplane, a skillful crew and good luck with the equipment.\"Flying to HurricanesHurricanes Earl and Karl each became important objects of observation for scientists during GRIP. The DC-8 flew to Earl four times, criss-crossing the storm as it intensified to a category 4 hurricane and then weakened. On the final Earl flight, as the storm was breaking down and losing strength, the Global Hawk made its debut hurricane flight and passed over Earl's eye in concert with the DC-8, providing valuable comparison measurements for the instruments on-board both aircraft. The WB-57 also flew Earl as well as Karl.At the outset, scientists hoped that several aspects of GRIP would help gather important data as well as complete a couple of technical accomplishments. First, collaboration with the Air Force, NOAA and the National Science Foundation would allow scientists to observe a single storm system with as many as six aircraft. Second, GRIP featured the debut of NASA's Global Hawk drone in a hurricane research capacity. The unmanned plane's 24-hour flight range gave scientists the ability to directly observe a hurricane as it changed over time and distance in a way that conventional planes and satellites have not done before.Both of these aspects of GRIP were used to great effect during the two major hurricanes observed during the campaign, Earl and Karl. \"We're all very pleased we were able to get the Global Hawk over a hurricane,\" said mission scientist Gerry Heymsfield, of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Md. \"There was a question about that. That's a major accomplishment both on the science side and the capability side. It really paves the way for future research.\"As the campaign went on, Global Hawk pilots, based remotely at Dryden Flight Research Center, near Palmdale, Calif., grew more comfortable with the drone's capability at 60,000 feet and over a hurricane. On Sept. 16 and 17, the Global Hawk made a 25-hour flight that included 20 passes over the eye of Karl as it was emerging into a hurricane -- precisely the type of formation and storm development that scientists hoped to capture during GRIP.\"None of our other planes can do that,\" said GRIP project manager Marilyn Vasques, of Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, Cal. \"They've been learning the capabilities of this aircraft at every flight. We challenged it more and more, and the aircraft and Dryden have performed really well.\"On that same flight, the collaboration with the other agencies reached full steam, as six aircraft flew over Karl. The DC-8 was even able to follow the storm after it made landfall in Mexico and began to deteriorate. It is unusual to get the clearances to fly over a hurricane once it has reached land, making the scientific payoff all the more valuable. \"We were able to capture some rare detail once it made landfall,\" Zipser said.What's in the data?For all the logistics involved in coordinating flights and using a drone designed for military purposes in a scientific campaign, the chief purpose of the experiment remained getting good data. The instruments on-board the GRIP planes provided 3-D observations of storm's cloud and precipitation structures, measurements of wind speed in the horizontal and the vertical dimensions, data on lightning strikes and lidar measurements of clouds and aerosols in and around hurricanes. These are all in addition to the basic yet important measurements of factors such as humidity, pressure and temperature that provide context for more advanced observations.While scientists will mine the GRIP observations for months and years, the team knows now that it was mostly able to fly over the types of storms and conditions that it wanted to fly over. Both Earl and Karl provided strong examples of rapid intensification. The Global Hawk arrived over Karl shortly after it reached hurricane status, and continued to fly over it as it rapidly strengthened to a Category 3 storm in the next nine to 12 hours. The flights over Karl could provide great insight into the genesis of that system, and the reasons for its rapid intensification soon after it passed over the Yucatan Peninsula and into the Gulf of Mexico.\"The flights into Karl as soon as it emerged over the Gulf and became a hurricane gave us just a fantastic example, and that was the day the Global Hawk did 20 passes over the eye,\" Zipser said. The GRIP planes were also able to fly to tropical systems -- such as Gaston -- that were forecast to strengthen and become hurricanes but ultimately did not. In the quest to understand why some tropical depressions become hurricanes and others don't, these were also important flights.The system known as Gaston formed out of an African easterly wave -- one of a number of depressions that routinely form off the coast of Africa and often become hurricanes. It was forecast to become a full-fledged hurricane but it didn't. \"It had all the elements to become a storm, so scientifically that's very interesting,\" Vasques said.Wrapping upWith the flight portion of the campaign ended, scientists will soon move on to analyzing the data they've gathered, Heymsfield said. Scientists who worked on GRIP and many others will likely mine this cache for years to come. These observations could provide insights with great value to science, which is still trying to fully understand hurricanes, and to society, which could eventually benefit from more accurate forecasts of storm strength and development.\"There will be some quick results. But the rest of it, in my experience, really takes years,\" Heymsfield said. \"This is probably the most timely, coupled experiment that I've ever seen. It's really worked out well. We collected a wealth of data that the scientists are really excited to analyze.\""}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_453", "content": "The NOAA Coral Reef Watch (CRW) satellite coral bleaching monitoring shows sea surface temperatures continue to remain above-average throughout the wider Caribbean region. Large areas of the southeastern Caribbean Sea are experiencing thermal stress capable of causing coral bleaching. The western Gulf of Mexico and the southern portion of the Bahamas have also experienced significant bleaching thermal stress. The CRW Coral Bleaching Thermal Stress Outlook indicates that the high stress should continue to develop in the southern and southeast Caribbean until mid-October. Prolonged coral bleaching, can lead to coral death and the subsequent loss of coral reef habitats for a range of marine life.\"The early warning predictions of NOAA's CRW program are vital to assist coral reef managers in making early preparations for coral bleaching events,\" says Billy Causey, southeast regional director for NOAA's Office of National Marine Sanctuaries. \"While managers can't do anything immediately to prevent coral bleaching, these early warnings give them time to monitor and track the stressful event, thus learning more about both direct and secondary impacts of bleaching on coral reefs around the world.\"The decline and loss of coral reefs has significant social, cultural, economic and ecological impacts on people and communities in the Caribbean, the United States, Australia and throughout the world. As the \"rainforests of the sea,\" coral reefs provide services estimated to be worth as much as $375 billion globally each year.\"High temperatures cause corals to force out the symbiotic algae that provide them with food. This makes the corals appear white or 'bleached' and can increase outbreaks of infectious disease,\" said Mark Eakin, Ph.D., coordinator of NOAA's Coral Reef Watch. \"Temperatures are high in the Caribbean, and we expect this to continue. This season has the potential to be one of the worst bleaching seasons for some reefs.\"\"A NOAA survey cruise just returned from the Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary where we saw serious bleaching,\" said Emma Hickerson, sanctuary research coordinator for the site, located off the coasts of Texas and Louisiana. \"Several species were bleached and we are concerned we could lose much of the fire corals this year.\"Even though a variety of stresses -- namely thermal stresses -- continue to rise in the Caribbean basin, temperatures are expected to begin cooling in the Gulf of Mexico and Florida. In addition, recent hurricanes and tropical storms that passed near the U.S. Virgin Islands have cooled the waters there. NOAA researchers have shown that tropical weather systems can cool the high temperatures that cause bleaching, and NOAA forecasts that this Atlantic hurricane season will probably be more active than usual.In 2005, the year of the worst bleaching on record in the Caribbean, no tropical storms passed close enough to cool the Virgin Islands, resulting in 90 percent of the area corals being bleached and 60 percent dying. Overall the 2005 bleaching event was the result of the largest, most intense thermal stress recorded in the Caribbean during the 25-year NOAA satellite record."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_454", "content": "The computer simulations show that a strong east wind, blowing overnight, could have pushed water back at a bend where an ancient river is believed to have merged with a coastal lagoon along the Mediterranean Sea. With the water pushed back into both waterways, a land bridge would have opened at the bend, enabling people to walk across exposed mud flats to safety. As soon as the wind died down, the waters would have rushed back in.The study is intended to present a possible scenario of events that are said to have taken place more than 3,000 years ago, although experts are uncertain whether they actually occurred. The research was based on a reconstruction of the likely locations and depths of Nile delta waterways, which have shifted considerably over time.\"The simulations match fairly closely with the account in Exodus,\" says Carl Drews of NCAR, the lead author. \"The parting of the waters can be understood through fluid dynamics. The wind moves the water in a way that's in accordance with physical laws, creating a safe passage with water on two sides and then abruptly allowing the water to rush back in.\"The study is part of a larger research project by Drews into the impacts of winds on water depths, including the extent to which Pacific Ocean typhoons can drive storm surges. By pinpointing a possible site south of the Mediterranean Sea for the crossing, the study also could be of benefit to experts seeking to research whether such an event ever took place. Archeologists and Egyptologists have found little direct evidence to substantiate many of the events described in Exodus.The work, published in the online journal, The Exodus account describes Moses and the fleeing Israelites trapped between the Pharaoh's advancing chariots and a body of water that has been variously translated as the Red Sea or the Sea of Reeds. In a divine miracle, the account continues, a mighty east wind blows all night, splitting the waters and leaving a passage of dry land with walls of water on both sides. The Israelites are able to flee to the other shore. But when the Pharaoh's army attempts to pursue them in the morning, the waters rush back and drown the soldiers.Scientists from time to time have tried to study whether the parting of the waters, one of the famous miracles in the Bible, can also be understood through natural processes. Some have speculated about a tsunami, which would have caused waters to retreat and advance rapidly. But such an event would not have caused the gradual overnight divide of the waters as described in the Bible, nor would it necessarily have been associated with winds.Other researchers have focused on a phenomenon known as \"wind setdown,\" in which a particularly strong and persistent wind can lower water levels in one area while piling up water downwind. Wind setdowns, which are the opposite of storm surges, have been widely documented, including an event in the Nile delta in the 19A previous computer modeling study into the Red Sea crossing by a pair of Russian researchers, Naum Voltzinger and Alexei Androsov, found that winds blowing from the northwest at minimal hurricane force (74 miles per hour) could, in theory, have exposed an underwater reef near the modern-day Suez Canal. This would have enabled people to walk across. The Russian study built on earlier work by oceanographers Doron Nof of Florida State University and Nathan Paldor of Hebrew University of Jerusalem that looked at the possible role of wind setdown.The new study, by Drews and CU oceanographer Weiqing Han, found that a reef would have had to be entirely flat for the water to drain off in 12 hours. A more realistic reef with lower and deeper sections would have retained channels that would have been difficult to wade through. In addition, Drews and Han were skeptical that refugees could have crossed during nearly hurricane-force winds.Studying maps of the ancient topography of the Nile delta, the researchers found an alternative site for the crossing about 75 miles north of the Suez reef and just south of the Mediterranean Sea. Although there are uncertainties about the waterways of the time, some oceanographers believe that an ancient branch of the Nile River flowed into a coastal lagoon then known as the Lake of Tanis. The two waterways would have come together to form a U-shaped curve.An extensive analysis of archeological records, satellite measurements, and current-day maps enabled the research team to estimate the water flow and depth that may have existed 3,000 years ago. Drews and Han then used a specialized ocean computer model to simulate the impact of an overnight wind at that site.They found that a wind of 63 miles an hour, lasting for 12 hours, would have pushed back waters estimated to be six feet deep. This would have exposed mud flats for four hours, creating a dry passage about 2 to 2.5 miles long and 3 miles wide. The water would be pushed back into both the lake and the channel of the river, creating barriers of water on both sides of newly exposed mud flats.As soon as the winds stopped, the waters would come rushing back, much like a tidal bore. Anyone still on the mud flats would be at risk of drowning.The set of 14 computer model simulations also showed that dry land could have been exposed in two nearby sites during a windstorm from the east. However, those sites contained only a single body of water and the wind would have pushed the water to one side rather than creating a dry passage through two areas of water.\"People have always been fascinated by this Exodus story, wondering if it comes from historical facts,\" Drews says. \"What this study shows is that the description of the waters parting indeed has a basis in physical laws.\""}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_455", "content": "Stone recently participated in a three-hour flyover of the affected area in the Gulf, where he said that subsurface oil was easily visible from overhead.\"It's most definitely there,\" said Stone. \"It's just a matter of time before it makes itself known again.\"Readings from WAVCIS indicate that the direction of the ocean currents near the middle and bottom of the water column are aimed offshore; in other words, this submerged oil will be pushed out to sea, where it will then rise higher into the water column and be washed onto land, particularly during storms.\"It is going to come on shore not consistently, but rather in pulses because it is beneath the surface,\" he said. \"You may get one or two, maybe even five or 10 waves coming ashore with absolutely no oil â¦ but eventually, it's going to come ashore.\" He also cautions that whatever oil doesn't remain suspended in the water column may simply sit atop the seafloor, waiting to be mixed back into the currents.\"It will simply be stirred up during rough seas or changing currents and reintroduced into the water column,\" he explained.Another timely concern is hurricane season since September is generally one of the most active months of the year. \"Storm surge, when combined with storm waves from a hurricane, could stir up this submerged oil and bring it -- lots of it -- onshore and into the wetlands,\" Stone said. \"Even a tropical storm could result in more oil on the shoreline. And that's a reality we need to consider and be prepared for.\"Formally known as the Wave-Current-Surge Information System, WAVCIS is based off of a network of buoys, oil platforms sensors and ADCPs, or Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers, in the Gulf of Mexico. The ADCPs are exceptionally sensitive. Housed on the seafloor, they send acoustic signals up to the surface of the water, measuring the entire water column for everything from current direction to speed and temperature. It's also integrated with the National Data Buoy Center, or NDBC, system, providing researchers worldwide with a comprehensive look at the Gulf environment, which is an invaluable research tool during the inevitable hurricane season, and also during disasters such as the Deepwater Horizon tragedy.\"WAVCIS is among the most sensitive ocean observing systems in the entire nation,\" said Stone. \"We measure a wide variety of physical parameters at the water surface, water column and on the sea bed. This information is extremely helpful in predicting or determining where the oil is -- and where it's going to go. Because our information is updated hourly and available to the public, our lab has played a primary role in providing facts about the situation surrounding the oil's movement and location.\"Stone, whose experience with WAVCIS has spanned everything from natural to manmade disasters, knows that only time will tell the severity of the oil's impact.\"This is a long term problem. It's not simply going to go away. I was in Prince William Sound 10 years after the Exxon-Valdez event, and when I lifted up a rock, there was still residual oil beneath it,\" he said. \"Thus, the residence time of oil in the coastal environment can be substantial, although ecosystem conditions along the northern Gulf are very different and will likely recover quicker than in Alaska. We here at WAVCIS can at least track Gulf conditions to monitor the situation as closely as possible.\"For more information about WAVCIS, visit"}

The next major solar storms are expected in 2012-13 as part of the sun's 11-year weather cycle. A 2008 US National Academy of Sciences report estimated that modern reliance on electronics and satellite communications means a major storm could cause twenty times more economic damage than Hurricane Katrina.Although major solar eruptions (coronal mass ejections) normally take several days to reach the Earth, the largest recorded in 1859 took just eighteen hours. Solar flares -- which can also cause significant disruption to communications systems -- take just a few minutes. So advance warning is of vital importance to enable steps to be taken to avoid the worst effects of solar activity.Up to now, solar weather prediction has been done manually, with experts looking at 2D satellite images of the sun and assessing the likelihood of future activity. But the team from the University of Bradford's Centre for Visual Computing have created the first online automated prediction system, using 3D images generated from the joint NASA/ESA Solar and Heliospheric Observatory satellite (SOHO). The system can be seen at work at Already in use by both NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA), the Bradford Automated Solar Activity Prediction system (ASAP) identifies and classifies sun spots and then feeds this information through a model which can predict the likelihood of solar flares. The system is able to accurately predict a solar flare six hours in advance and the team are working to achieve a similar accuracy for the prediction of major solar eruptions in the near future.Reader in Visual Computing, Dr Rami Qahwaji, who led the EPSRC-funded research, says: \"Solar weather prediction is still very much in its infancy, probably at about the point that normal weather forecasting was around 50 years ago.\"However, our system is a major step forward. By creating an automated system that can work in real time, we open up the possibility for much faster prediction and -- with sufficient data -- prediction of a wider range of activity. With NASA's new Solar Dynamic Observatory satellite which came into operation in May, we have the chance to see the sun's activity in much greater detail which will further improve our prediction capabilities.\"The ASAP model is based on historical data which was analysed to identify patterns in the sun's activity. Dr Qahwaji is now applying for more funding to further improve the system and ensure it can be adapted to work with the latest sun monitoring satellites."}

Investigators believe that housing and community instability and the uncertainty of recovery undermine family resilience and the emotional health of children. These factors characterize what researchers are calling a failed recovery for the Gulf region's most vulnerable population: economically disadvantaged children whose families remain displaced.The CHF report, \"Legacy of Katrina: The Impact of a Flawed Recovery on Vulnerable Children of the Gulf Coast,\" expands upon on a study by NCDP researchers, who have followed a cohort of more than 1,000 families affected by Katrina and the ensuing disruption.According to the Gulf Coast Child & Family Health Study, funded by the Children's Health Fund and published in the current issue of American Medical Association's \"This study points to a major crisis facing the children of the post-Katrina Gulf Region,\" says Irwin Redlener, M.D., director of the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia's Mailman School of Public Health and president of the Children's Health Fund. \"From the perspective of the Gulf's most vulnerable children and families, the recovery from Katrina and the flooding of New Orleans has been a dismal failure.\"\"Previous studies have demonstrated a significant increase in the prevalence of anxiety, depression and posttraumatic stress disorder following Hurricane Katrina, as well as a rise in violence and suicide,\" said Italo Subbarao D.O., MBA, deputy editor of AMA's Disaster Medicine and Public Health Preparedness journal. \"This study adds further credence to widely accepted views that adults and children affected by catastrophic emergencies can experience up to a 40 percent increased in mental and behavioral illness.\"According to David M. Abramson, Ph.D., MPH, director of research at the NCDP and senior author of the study which looked at the roles of parents and communities in children's recovery, \"Children are completely dependent upon others in their lives to provide the security and stability that will help them recover. This suggests that the many support systems in children's lives -- their parents, their communities, and their schools -- are not yet functioning properly. The slow recovery of children's mental health in Gulf Coast populations is a bellwether indicator of how well the region is recovering.\"Additional key findings:The study findings are supported by clinical data from the Children's Health Fund, which provides mobile clinics that travel to underserved areas in the Gulf Coast to provide care for families and children. In the period of June 2009 through June 2010, despite improvement in housing conditions in Louisiana, psychiatric, developmental or learning-related disorders in children were diagnosed as frequently as respiratory illness. And in New Orleans alone, approximately 30,000 school children were not able to return to public school. However, data also shows that children who were relocated sooner did better in school than students with longer periods of displacement and those who were enrolled in higher performing schools did the best, thus highlighting the importance of social systems in a child's post-disaster recovery.Both the study and the clinical reports from the Children's Health Fund's Gulf Coast pediatric programs paint a clear picture of how insufficient government response and recovery efforts continue to take a toll on children's welfare, especially those who are the most underserved. Dr.Redlener, a pediatrician and professor at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health, outlined a number of implications for policymakers and others: \"Affected families need urgent assistance to return to a state of 'normalcy' characterized by safe communities and stable housing. Nearly two out of three children affected by Katrina continue to experience serious mental and behavioral problems or the stress of unstable housing or both, with children living in poverty over two times as susceptible to serious emotional disorders. We believe that this represents at least 20,000 children affected by Katrina -- and perhaps considerably more. Immediate action needs to be taken to increase mental health services in the region.\"Dr. Redlener continues, \"And it's not just clinical services that are needed by these marginalized families. Every effort must be made to rapidly bring back a 'state of normalcy', that is, stable safe housing for every family in communities with appropriate access to essential services and economic stability.\"The Gulf Coast Child & Family Health Study has collected mental health data in the Gulf Coast since January 2006 and covers a random sample of 1,079 households in Louisiana and Mississippi, including 427 children. Face-to-face interviews were conducted by trained interviewers, and the key outcome variable was Serious Emotional Disturbance, based upon the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), a widely validated diagnostic screener. The data were collected in four waves over the course of four years with the majority of data for this analysis drawn from the fourth round of data, collected through March 2010."}

These and other findings are reported in a special section of \"Katrina taught us a harsh lesson about the plight of vulnerable people in times of disaster and national emergency,\" said the journal's editor, Timothy Elliott, PhD, of Texas A&M University. \"Solutions to these problems won't be provided by any single profession or service, which is why this special section brings together colleagues from psychology, special education and rehabilitation administration to provide information that will help us find solutions.\"In a study looking at Hurricane Katrina victims, researchers focused on survivors with a wide range of disabilities. Nearly two years after the storm, they surveyed and interviewed disaster case managers and supervisors who provided services to 2,047 individuals with disabilities and their families through the Katrina Aid Today project. They found that considerable barriers to housing, transportation and disaster services were still present two years after the storm. For example, they found that survivors with disabilities were less likely to own homes than survivors without disabilities. This meant that some of the Federal Emergency Management Agency homeowner programs did not help them or, in the case of FEMA trailers, were not accessible to them.People with disabilities were also less likely to be employed, which affected their ability to pay utility bills or purchase furniture when they did transition to more permanent housing. Individuals with disabilities were more likely to have medical needs, which affected their ability to travel to service agencies or get jobs. Case management with the survivors with disabilities was seen as taking longer because these people needed assistance in multiple areas.\"Case managers who are knowledgeable about the needs of people with disabilities are essential when navigating an already difficult service system following a disaster of this magnitude,\" said the study's lead author, Laura Stough, PhD, from Texas A&M University.Another analysis focused on two different studies -- one examining the bombing's survivors and the other Hurricane Katrina evacuees. The Oklahoma City study assessed 182 survivors six months after the bombing. The Hurricane Katrina study sampled 421 people who had been evaluated in a mental health clinic at a Dallas shelter for Katrina evacuees.Of the Oklahoma City bombing survivors, the most common psychiatric diagnosis was post-traumatic stress disorder, with 34 percent of participants suffering from the problem. The second most common psychiatric diagnosis was major depression, according to the article. Most of the participants, 87 percent, were injured in the bombing; 20 percent of those had to be hospitalized.The research analysis noted that Hurricane Katrina affected a wider swath of an already disadvantaged population. The main tasks in the psychiatry clinic at the shelter were rapid diagnostic assessment, resumption of psychotropic medications, and linkage to ongoing psychiatric care for already existing disorders.\"Interventions to address unmet treatment needs for an abundance of pre-existing and persistent psychiatric illness would not have been the primary response needed for Oklahoma City survivors,\" said the study's lead author, Carol North, MD, from the Dallas Veterans Affairs Medical Center and the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas. \"This article represents just one example of why disaster intervention plans need to target expected mental health problems emerging in different populations, settings and time frames.\"Another study looked at the prevalence of injury and illness following Hurricane Ike in the Galveston, Texas, area. About 4 percent of the population had experienced injuries, and 16 percent of households had someone suffering from an illness two to six months following the disaster, according to a survey of 658 adults. The risk for injury or illness increased in areas where there was more damage. Some other stressors that occurred at the same time as these injuries or illnesses were post-traumatic stress, dysfunction and physical disability.\"The associations of injury with distress and disability suggest that community programs should reach out to injured people for early mental health and functional assessments,\" said study author Fran Norris, PhD, director of the National Center for Disaster Mental Health Research at the Dartmouth Medical School. \"Follow-up support services that address mental health and functional problems could be part of the treatment plan for those people treated for disaster-related injuries or illnesses.\""}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_460", "content": "We've all seen fat rain drops, skinny rain drops, round hailstones, fluffy snowflakes and even ice needles. This summer, NASA researchers are going to get a look at just how much these shapes influence severe storm weather. To do it, they'll have to look inside the guts of some of the world's fiercest storms. NASA recently assembled a team of hurricane scientists from across the country to carry out high-altitude-aircraft surveillance to explore in detail how storms form, intensify and dissipate.Earth scientists and engineers at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala., have redesigned one of their instruments, the Advanced Microwave Precipitation Radiometer, or AMPR, to better observe the different shapes of precipitation. In August and September, AMPR will fly at an altitude of 60,000 feet over the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic Ocean. It will sit in the bomb bay of a WB-57 airplane, which is based at the NASA Johnson Space Center's Ellington Field in Houston.During these flights, AMPR researchers will test a new build -- the instrument is an upgraded version of the original AMPR built at NASA Marshall in the early 1990s -- and use it to participate in NASA's upcoming hurricane study, the Genesis and Rapid Intensification Processes field campaign, better known as GRIP. The campaign involves three planes mounted with 14 different instruments, including AMPR. The instruments will all work together to create the most complete view of a hurricane to date.Researchers hope the hurricane campaign will help them answer some of nature's most perplexing questions. As tropical storms grow, they produce massive amounts of rain -- a key element in the development of full-scale hurricanes. Scientists will use AMPR along with the other instruments, such as data from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission or TRMM satellite, to figure out just how hard it's raining inside these ferocious storms, and how much of that rain is associated with the production of ice during intensification.\"If you don't know how hard it's raining or where the rain is forming in the atmosphere, you don't know hurricanes,\" said Dr. Walt Petersen, AMPR principle investigator and Marshall Center earth scientist. \"AMPR provides us an opportunity to see their precipitation structure by using an instrument like those currently flying on, for example, the TRMM and Aqua satellites in space.\"That's because AMPR doesn't just give scientists new information about hurricanes. The instrument also enables them to test equipment currently in space. Every day, numerous weather satellites orbit Earth to measure the rainfall rate of storms across the globe. They work much like AMPR except over much larger scales. Because they're so far above the Earth and moving so fast, they can take only one measurement every few miles along their track. Scientists can correct for such coarse measurements, but to do so they need highly accurate data. AMPR can take several measurements per mile, giving scientists the data they need to verify that weather satellites continue to provide accurate data.\"It's like the pixels in your computer screen,\" Petersen said. \"When satellites take measurements, they have really big pixels, and we might lose some of the finer details of what's happening on the ground. AMPR has much smaller pixels, much higher resolution, and allows us to see a much clearer picture. It's a part of our arsenal to make sure what we're measuring from space makes sense. We'd hate to send something up and not have it accurately measure what's happening on the ground.\"That information translates into better predictions of hurricane track and intensity -- how hard it's going to rain in a certain area when a hurricane hits, for example, aiding in early flood warnings.AMPR doesn't just measure how hard rain falls. Within the last several years, the AMPR team has worked vigorously to upgrade the instrument. These upgrades will enable AMPR to more accurately detect what kind of precipitation is in the storm. By identifying the shape of the precipitation, AMPR may present scientists with recognizable signatures that define different types of precipitation. For example, varying combinations of fat or skinny rain drops, snow, ice or hail distributed throughout the depth of the storm will produce different brightness temperatures when viewed at different angles. A storm may develop and behave differently depending on these variations.Engineers packed the 380-pound AMPR payload with a delicate set of instruments and computer hardware. AMPR gathers data by measuring the amount of microwave radiation rising from the surface beneath -- often the ocean. Because rain water is a better emitter of microwave radiation than ocean water, the radiation measured from rainfall is actually greater during a big storm. This measurement is converted to a \"brightness temperature,\" which correlates to how much radiation is being generated. The more rain, the higher the brightness temperature.Alternatively, if a hurricane's clouds are full of ice or hail, as they usually are, much of the microwave radiation is scattered away. The corresponding brightness temperature is much lower than the anticipated surface measurement. Scientists can use those changes to determine how hard it's raining inside a storm or how much ice a given storm might contain.\"Whether rain drops are fat or skinny, and whether ice is round or bumpy, these factors are critical when we're trying to estimate rainfall rates,\" Petersen explained. \"Because of air drag, the rate at which these precipitation particles fall through the air depends on their thickness or shape. A fat rain drop falls more slowly than a hail stone of the same size, for example -- that factor enables you to determine rainfall rate.\"After the GRIP experiment ends in September, Petersen and his team will unload the data and begin analyzing it, adding their findings to the increasingly large body of hurricane knowledge.\"The GRIP experiment will give us information about how a hurricane circulates and how it intensifies. Basically we have a bunch of theories about the role of precipitation in hurricanes, and we need to test them. That's where instruments like AMPR come in.\"After this summer's hurricane study, AMPR will continue to fly in storm campaigns. It's already scheduled for a major joint NASA and U.S. Department of Energy study in April 2011 to support the Global Precipitation Measurement.Petersen loves the challenge. Storms have fascinated him ever since his junior year of high school, when lightning struck just inches away from him while he was at a drive-in movie.\"The thing that excites me is looking inside a storm that we can't fly into,\" he said. \"We can't fly inside these big storms because they're just too nasty. The only way to get information about what's going on inside is to do what AMPR does.\"Being able to look at the guts of a storm and figure out what's going on, that's the key thing for me,\" he added.With any luck, AMPR's look into hurricanes will put scientists one step closer to predicting some of the world's fiercest storms."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_461", "content": "It turns out that the formation of typhoons -- as hurricanes are known in the region -- is heavily mediated by the presence of chlorophyll, a green pigment that helps the tiny single-celled organisms known as phytoplankton convert sunlight into food for the rest of the marine ecosystem. Chlorophyll contributes to the ocean's color.\"We think of the oceans as blue, but the oceans aren't really blue, they're actually a sort of greenish color,\" said Anand Gnanadesikan, a researcher with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory in Princeton, New Jersey. \"The fact that [the oceans] are not blue has a [direct] impacton the distribution of tropical cyclones.\"In the study, to be published in an upcoming issue of Gnanadesikan compared hurricane formation rates in a computer model under two scenarios. For the first, he modeled real conditions using chlorophyll concentrations in the North Pacific observed by satellites. He then compared that to a scenario where the chlorophyll concentration in parts ofthe North Pacific Subtropical Gyre -- a large, clockwise-circulation pattern encompassing most of the North Pacific -- was set to zero.In the latter scenario, the absence of chlorophyll in the subtropical gyre affected hurricane formation by modifying air circulation and heat distribution patterns both within and beyond the gyre. In fact, along the equator, those new patterns outside the gyre led to an increase in hurricane formation of about 20 percent. Yet, this rise was more than made up for by the 70 percent decrease in storms further north, over and near the gyre. The model showed that more hurricanes would hit the Philippines and Vietnam, but fewer would make landfall in South China and Japan.In the no-chlorophyll scenario, sunlight is able to penetrate deeper into the ocean, leaving the surface water cooler. The drop in the surface temperature in the model affects hurricane formation in three main ways: cold water provides less energy; air circulation patterns change, leading to more dry air aloft which makes it hard for hurricanes to grow.The changes in air circulation trigger strong winds aloft, which tend to prevent thunderstorms from developing the necessary superstructure that allows them to grow into hurricanes.A decrease in hurricanes in the North Pacific is just one example of how changing chlorophyll concentrations can have far-reaching, previously unconsidered, effects. The specific outcomes over different patches of the ocean will vary based on local currents and ocean conditions, said Gnanadesikan.A complete absence of chlorophyll in parts of the ocean would be a drastic change, Gnanadesikanadmits. Yet, its potential impact is still important to consider, he maintains. The northern Pacific gyre that he studied is already the \"biological desert of the ocean,\" he said. So the surprise, then, is that \"even in this region that is apparently clear, biologically-mediated heating is important.\"This research was primarily supported by NOAA, with additional support from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration."}

This is the first time these buoys will be used in the typhoon-prone Western Pacific. In the past, these buoy deployments have taken place in the Atlantic Ocean during hurricane season, and on separate experiments in the Southern Ocean and Labrador Sea.The researchers are deploying the two sets of buoys in tandem, about 450 miles southeast of Taiwan to thoroughly test them in typhoon force conditions. The buoys will be out at sea for 3 months collecting valuable data that scientists will use to understand the exchange dynamics and fluxes occurring between the atmosphere and ocean during the intense typhoon conditions.\"We have successfully used these buoys to measure air-sea interactions and wave dynamics in the Atlantic in a variety of storm conditions and are now looking forward to applying this technology to the western Pacific where super typhoons develop quite frequently,\" said the PI of this project, Dr. Hans Graber, professor and executive director of UM's Center for Southeastern Tropical Advanced Remote Sensing. \"In the last several years we have added new technologies and improved the data collection capabilities of these buoys as well as made the buoys more robust to withstand extreme weather conditions. In addition we will also be using satellite telecommunications to query the buoys routinely from Miami and retrieve data. \"The buoys will measure the momentum, heat, and moisture exchange between the air atmosphere and ocean at the midst of tropical cyclones. This information will help improve weather forecast models that predict typhoon intensity. It will also give the research community a better idea of the distribution of wind and how force is distributed. There will be sonic anemometers (acoustic devices that measure wind speed and stress at high resolution) and a suite of other sensors that measure air temperature, humidity, and water temperature. The buoys will also have ADCPs (acoustic Doppler current profilers) to measure currents as a function of depth, as well as temperature probes in the upper ocean and acoustic devices to measure turbulence near the surface. A strong set of piano-like wires arranged in a pentagon will measure small scale details of the ocean surface (roughness) and the directional properties of waves.\"The buoys feature a Compact Lightweight Aerosol Spectrometer (CLASP) device that measures the near-surface marine aerosol production mechanisms, or sea spray from wave-breaking events that result from typhoon force winds,\" said Dr. Will Drennan, UM professor and associate dean of undergraduate studies for the Rosenstiel School. \"These measurements could be especially important as the spray layer has a significant impact on the drag coefficient, a key parameter used in creating weather forecast models.\"The team includes several people from UM, including applied marine physics professors Hans Graber and Will Drennan, associate scientist Neil Williams, marine technician Mike Rebozo, post-doctoral researchers Rafael Ramos and Michelle Gierach, graduate students BjÃ¶rn Lund, Henry Potter, Tripp Collins and Sharein El-Tourky, and undergraduate Marine Science student Anibal Herrera.

{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_463", "content": "The exact conditions required to kickstart a tropical depression into a hurricane largely remain a mystery. Though scientists know many of the ingredients needed, it is unclear what processes ultimately drive depressions to form into the intense, spinning storms that lash the U.S. coasts each summer.\"Hurricane formation and intensification is really the 'holy grail' of this field,\" said Ed Zipser, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Utah and one of three program scientists helping to lead the Genesis and Rapid Intensification Processes (GRIP) experiment this summer.With GRIP, NASA's first domestic hurricane project since 2001, the agency has assembled the largest-ever hurricane research experiment to investigate these questions. Three NASA planes, multiple NASA satellites and four planes from research partners NOAA and NSF will combine to make unprecedented measurements of tropical storms as they are forming (or dying out) and intensifying (or weakening). The intense scientific focus on these meteorological processes could provide new insight into the fundamental physics of hurricanes and ultimately improve our ability to forecast the strength of a storm at landfall. Predictions of hurricane strength continue to lag behind the accuracy of storm track predictions, but accurate predictions of both are needed for the best possible preparation before landfall.With each aircraft outfitted with multiple instruments, scientists will be taking a closer look at hurricanes with hopes of gaining insight into which physical processes or large-scale environmental factors are the key triggers in hurricane formation and intensification.The GRIP fleet includes NASA's Global Hawk, the unmanned drone built by Northrop Grumman and also used by the U.S. Air Force, WB-57 and DC-8. The NASA aircraft will be deployed from Florida (DC-8), Texas (WB-57) and California (Global Hawk) and will fly at varying altitudes over tropical storms in an attempt to capture them at different stages of development.\"One of the potential data-gathering breakthroughs of GRIP could be to continuously observe a tropical storm or hurricane for 24 hours straight, by including aircraft from all three agencies,\" said GRIP Project Manager Marilyn Vasques. The Global Hawk alone could fly continuously over a storm system for up to 16 hours.While geostationary satellites used for forecasting can observe the basic movement of a storm across the Atlantic, these aircraft instruments will be able to \"see\" below the cloud-tops and uncover what is happening in the internal structure of the storm.\"That's what makes this really unique, the ability to observe one of these storms up close as it changes over its life-cycle. Before we've only been able to get a few hours of data at a time,\" Vasques said. \"We want to see storms that become hurricanes, and we want to see some that don't become hurricanes, so we can compare the data. The same is true for hurricane intensification.\"\"When you think of analyzing it later, we want to break down what the temperatures were, what the winds were doing, what the aerosol concentration was, to see if we can start detecting a pattern,\" Vasques said.The variety and number of instruments will allow scientists to investigate multiple science questions at once: What role does dust from the Sahara play in hurricane formation? Can lightning be used as a predictor of a storm's change in intensity? Do widespread environmental conditions such as humidity, temperature, precipitation and clouds lead to cyclone formation, or are smaller-scale interactions between some of these same elements the cause?Scientists at NASA and the many academic and government research partners in GRIP are excited to put several new state-of-the-art hurricane observing instruments in the field. A powerful microwave radiometer and a radar will provide insight into the massive \"hot towers\" of convection found in cyclones, and a NASA-designed and -built lidar (laser radar) will provide the first-ever measurements of wind speed in three dimensions -- not just east, west, north and south, but also vertically.These instrument advancements, in addition to the deployment of the Global Hawk in a major Earth science campaign for the first time, have NASA scientists anxious to take to the field.\"This is one of the most exciting points in my career,\" said Ramesh Kakar, GRIP program manager and lead of NASA's recently formed Hurricane Science Research Team. \"Satellites can only get a brief glimpse of what is happening inside a hurricane, and we get very excited about seeing that. Now imagine if you could watch a storm unfold for 20 hours.\"The ability to keep an eye on developing storms for that length of time will largely depend on a complex deployment of the various planes, from different locations, at different times and at different altitudes. The NASA planes have different flight ranges, with the DC-8 able to fly for eight hours, the WB-57 four hours and the Global Hawk 30 hours. Those flight ranges include the time required to get to the storm and back to home base.\"In general, when the aircraft are deployed to study potentially developing hurricanes, they will fly a basic grid pattern over the weather system,\" Zipser said. 'Ideally this pattern will be repeated on consecutive days. Once planes are flying over an established hurricane, they'll fly repeatedly over the eye of the storm and covering its breadth, creating somewhat of an asterisk pattern centered on the eye. Flights on consecutive days will deliver the best cache of data on how the storm changed over time.\"Flights begin Aug. 15 and will last until Sept. 25."}

The findings have implications for health and economic policies going forward.Among the key survey findings:\"Over the last few days we are seeing an effort by officials who are suggesting that, as the oil is less visible on the surface, the 'crisis is over.' Clearly, this is far from the case,\" says Irwin Redlener, MD, director of the National Center for Disaster Preparedness (NCPD) at Columbia's Mailman School of Public Health and president of the Children's Health Fund (CHF). \"As shown by our survey, done after the well was capped, there is a significant and persistent public health crisis underscored by the large number of children with medical and psychological problems related to the oil disaster. These concerns will need to be assessed and managed in these coastal communities where there are few or no pediatricians and vastly insufficient mental health professional capacity.'The survey found a dramatic relationship between economic vulnerability and health effects. Adults with household incomes under $25,000 were by far the most likely to report physical and mental health effects for themselves and also among their children.\"Much the way Hurricane Katrina had its greatest effect on those with the least, the oil spill is also having a greater impact on those coastal residents who are 'economically vulnerable,' says David Abramson, PhD, MPH, director of Research at NCDP and assistant professor of clinical sociomedical sciences at the Mailman School. \"In an area still recovering from the 2005 Hurricane Katrina, the oil spill represents a significant test of a population's resiliency.\"Dr. Redlener, a pediatrician and professor at the Mailman School, outlined a number of implications for policymakers and others: \"Guidelines need to be developed, with active participation of relevant federal agencies, with respect to the short- and long-term health risks of remaining in affected communities. This should include recommendations, based on known science, on when families would be advised to move out of the community entirely.\" He also believes BP should provide funds to state and local agencies involved with providing assessment and care to affected families. \"Children are particularly susceptible to the consequences of this disaster and need to have special resources focused on their needs.\"The National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia's Mailman School, which designed the survey, intends to follow a cohort of at least 1,000 children and adults in the region to determine the continuing health and mental health consequences of the oil spill.

{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_466", "content": "Geography doctoral student Jill C. Malmstadt, working with Professor James B. Elsner and research consultant Thomas H. Jagger, created the Hurricane Risk Calculator and used it to estimate the risk to 12 cities in Florida. The findings are outlined in \"Risk of Strong Hurricane Winds to Florida Cities,\" to be published in the November issue of the American Meteorological Society's\"Not unexpectedly, we found that the extreme wind risk from hurricanes varies across the state,\" Malmstadt said. \"Areas in the northeast, such as Jacksonville and in the Big Bend between Tampa and Tallahassee, have longer periods between occurrences of a given strong wind speed compared to areas such as Miami and Pensacola. That's also where we found the highest annual threats of a catastrophic hurricane event.\"Using the Hurricane Risk Calculator, the researchers found that Miami can expect to see winds of 112 mph or stronger -- that's a category 3 hurricane -- once every 12 years on average. Miami last saw winds of that strength with Hurricane Wilma in 2005. By contrast, Tallahassee, the state's least vulnerable city, can expect to see winds of that speed only once every 500 years.The Hurricane Risk Calculator is a statistical model based on extreme value theory -- a theory that is used to estimate the occurrence of the rare and extreme events like hurricanes Andrew and Katrina, Malmstadt said. Researchers applied the theory to wind speed data derived from the National Hurricane Center's Hurricane Database, which is the official record of tropical cyclones for the Atlantic Ocean, Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea dating back to 1851.\"This method is unique because it uses extreme value distributions that allow us to better estimate extreme events,\" Malmstadt said. \"Other approaches use various distributions that work incredibly well when trying to estimate the average event, like category 1 or 2 hurricanes. They may be underestimating or overestimating the extremes even if they are right on with the average.\"The Hurricane Risk Calculator can provide important information to emergency planners, the insurance industry and homeowners, Malmstadt said, noting that the state of Florida especially has experienced more than $450 billion in damages from hurricanes since the early 20th century.\"Hurricanes top the list of the most destructive and costly natural disasters in the United States,\" she said. \"For society to better cope with and mitigate these disasters, a more precise estimate of the risk of high winds on the local level is needed. The Hurricane Risk Calculator does that.\"Florida is particularly vulnerable to hurricanes because warm seas surround the state, but some locations are even more vulnerable than others. Along with Miami, its South Florida neighbors Port St. Lucie, Key West and Cape Coral are the cities with the highest wind strength and shortest return periods.Gulf Coast cities Pensacola and Panama City are no strangers to strong hurricane winds, although their locations in the western Panhandle mean they are protected somewhat by the Florida peninsula itself from winds coming from the southeast. Still, Pensacola can expect to see a hurricane with 112 mph winds once every 24 years, according to Malmstadt.The cities of Orlando, Tampa and Jacksonville join Tallahassee as the cities with the least vulnerability.Still, Malmstadt cautioned that \"people who live anywhere in Florida could receive a hurricane threat, so they should always be ready and prepared for one of the extremes.\"The researchers also used the data that went into the Hurricane Risk Calculator to determine whether the wind risk from hurricanes is changing over time. Although they found that the frequency of hurricanes and major hurricanes is constant throughout time, there is an upward trend in the intensity of the strongest hurricanes in Florida. Intensification refers to the amount of increase in maximum wind speeds between hourly observations of a given hurricane.\"The strongest hurricanes appear to be getting stronger,\" Malmstadt said. \"This is consistent with the increasing ocean heat content noted over the Gulf of Mexico and the western Caribbean.\"However, the greater intensification rates do not necessarily mean that hurricanes are more intense at the point of landfall, she said, adding that additional study is needed to make that determination.The National Science Foundation, the Risk Prediction Initiative of the Bermuda Institute for Ocean Studies and the Florida Catastrophic Storm Risk Management Center provided support for this study."}

In addition to deploying dropsondes--parachute-borne instrument packages--the researchers will use remote sensing and cloud physics instruments to gather data on temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction, and characteristics of ice particles and their nuclei, which may include African dust.\"We hope to test recently developed hypotheses about flow features of tropical waves that help distinguish which ones will develop into tropical storms,\" said Christopher Davis, of the NSF-sponsored National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) and a principal investigator on the project. \"These hypotheses require measurements across hundreds of miles, but with details in places down to one mile or so, and even less when we consider the ice particles themselves.\"The NSF/NCAR research team will coordinate their observations with two concurrent, but independent, missions in the region: the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) project known as GRIP (Genesis and Rapid Intensification Processes) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) IFEX (Intensity Forecasting Experiment).\"The NSF/NCAR G-V offers us unprecedented capability to collect critical atmospheric measurements over regions far larger than has been practical for traditional 'lower-and-slower' turboprop hurricane-hunter aircraft,\" added Bradley Smull, NSF program director for Physical and Dynamic Meteorology. \"The G-V will allow our investigators to sample the inner workings of a large number of towering tropical cloud systems, and ultimately to better discriminate those that will develop into full-blown hurricanes from those that will not.\"In addition to researchers from NCAR, the project will include collaborators from the Naval Postgraduate School, University at Albany-SUNY, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, University of Miami, NorthWest Research Associates of Redmond, Wash., New Mexico Tech, Purdue University, and University of Wisconsin-Madison."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_468", "content": "Now a NASA-funded research scientist at the University of Maryland-College Park, Shen has employed NASA's Pleiades supercomputer and atmospheric data to simulate tropical cyclone Nargis, which devastated Myanmar in 2008. The result is the first model to replicate the formation of the tropical cyclone five days in advance.To save lives from the high winds, flooding, and storm surges of tropical cyclones (also known as hurricanes and typhoons), forecasters need to give as much advance warning as possible and the greatest degree of accuracy about when and where a storm will occur. In Shen's retrospective simulation, he was able to anticipate the storm five days in advance of its birth, a critical forewarning in a region where the meteorology and monitoring of cyclones is hampered by a lack of data.At the heart of Shen's work is an advanced computer model that could improve our understanding of the predictability of tropical cyclones. The research team uses the model to run millions of numbers -- atmospheric conditions like wind speed, temperature, and moisture -- through a series of equations. This results in digital data of the cyclone's location and atmospheric conditions that are plotted on geographical maps.Scientists study the maps and data from the model and compare them against real observations of a past storm (like Nargis) to evaluate the model's accuracy. The more the model reflects the actual storm results, the greater confidence researchers have that a particular model can be used to paint a picture of what the future might look like.\"To do hurricane forecasting, what's really needed is a model that can represent the initial weather conditions -- air movements and temperatures, and precipitation -- and simulate how they evolve and interact globally and locally to set a cyclone in motion,\" said Shen, whose study appeared online last week in the \"We know what's happening across very large areas. So, we need really good, high-resolution simulations with the ability to detail conditions across the smallest possible areas. We've marked several forecasting milestones since 2004, and we can now compute a storm's fine-scale details to 10 times the level of detail than we could with traditional climate models.\"The cyclone's birth prediction is possible because the supercomputer at NASA's Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, Calif., can process atmospheric data for global and regional conditions, as well as the fine-scale measurements like those around the eye of a storm. NASA built the Pleiades supercomputer in 2008, incrementally boosting its processing \"brain power\" since to the capacity of 81,920 desktop CPUs. The upgrades laid the groundwork for Shen and others to gradually improve simulations of varying aspects of a storm -- from simulations of the path, then intensity, and now the actual genesis of a storm.The improved simulations can translate into greater accuracy and less guesswork in assessing when a storm is forming.\"There is a tendency to over-warn beyond the actual impact area of a storm, leading people to lose confidence in the warning system and to ignore warnings that can save their lives,\" said study co-author Robert Atlas, director of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory in Miami, Fla., and former chief meteorologist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md.\"Although we've seen tremendous forecasting advances in the past 10 years -- with potential to improve predictions of a cyclone's path and intensity -- they're still not good enough for all of the life-and-death decisions that forecasters have to make. Tropical cyclones have killed nearly two million people in the last 200 years, so this remaining 'cone of uncertainty' in our predictions is unacceptable.\"As promising as the new model may be, Atlas cautions that \"Shen's model worked for one cyclone, but it doesn't mean it'll work in real-time for future storms. The research model Shen and predecessors at NASA have developed sets the stage for NOAA's researchers to hone and test the new capability with their own models.\"Shen's use of real data from Nargis -- one of the 10 deadliest cyclones on record -- with the new global model also yields insights into the dynamics of weather conditions over time and across different areas that generate such storms.\"In the last few years, high-resolution global modeling has evolved our understanding of the physics behind storms and its interaction with atmospheric conditions more rapidly than in the past several decades combined,\" explained Shen, who presented the study last month before peers at the American Geophysical Union's Western Pacific Geophysics Meeting in Taipei, Taiwan. \"We can 'see' a storm's physical processes with this advanced global model -- like both the release of heat associated with rainfall and changes in environmental atmospheric flow, which was very difficult until now.\""}

The children lived in a New Orleans school district that was heavily damaged by the hurricane.When the researchers looked at the children two and three years after Katrina hit, they found that overall trauma symptoms (such as feeling depressed, sad, nervous, and having trouble concentrating and sleeping) had decreased. Furthermore, 45 percent of the children were found to be resistant to stress and lacked long-term psychological problems. The children's strengths, the researchers found, were largely the result of rebuilt schools (St. Bernard Parish reopened within 2-1/2 months of the hurricane) and supportive relationships (including the classmates students interacted with when they returned to school).But this work in progress also found that more than a quarter of the children continued to have significant trauma symptoms of post-traumatic stress and depression three years later. Children who reported these symptoms were more likely to be younger, female, have seen a mental health professional, and also report family or school problems. They also reported being exposed to more traumas.A second study on children affected by Katrina, conducted by researchers at the University of Missouri and The Pennsylvania State University, looked at the issue from the perspective of gender. Experiencing distress is a normal part of life, yet males and females have been found to show different patterns of stress reactions in laboratory studies.In this study, researchers looked at more than 60 teens (ages 12 to 19) who had been displaced by Katrina and were living in a government relocation camp with their families two months after the hurricane. Most of the participants were African American teens from low-income families that had lived in New Orleans. The researchers measured psychological functioning (such as depression and aggression) and two hormone markers of stress regulation (salivary cortisol and alpha-amylase), then compared these with more than 50 adolescents who were demographically similar but lived in a part of the United States that wasn't affected by Katrina.Male and female teens who experienced the hurricane showed distinct patterns of behavioral stress as well as gender differences in how they regulated physiological stress, the study found. Specifically, compared to the children who weren't exposed to Katrina, girls who survived the hurricane were more depressed and boys showed lower levels of aggression and higher levels of confidence. Heightened stress hormonal reactions were likewise associated with depression in girls and confidence in boys.In suggesting that males and females develop specialized systems for processing and responding to stress, the study adds to our understanding of normative stress regulation following trauma."}

TRMM Precipitation Radar (PR) and TRMM Microwave Imager (TMI) data from the orbit were used when creating the rainfall analysis. That rainfall analysis showed intensifying tropical storm Conson was already very well organized. TRMM data clearly showed that an eye was forming with heavy thunderstorms located northeast of the storm's center of circulation. Those thunderstorms were dropping rainfall at a rate of almost 2 inches per hour.Hal Pierce of NASA's TRMM Team, located at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. created the 3-D animation of Typhoon Conson using data from July 12. In the animation, Pierce said that \"The developing eye is shown reaching to heights above 15 kilometers (~9 miles).\"There were also hot towers around Conson's eye. A hot tower is a tropical cumulonimbus cloud that punches through the tropopause and reaches into the stratosphere. They are called \"hot towers\" because they rise high due to the large amount of latent heat released as water vapor condenses into liquid and freezes into ice. Hot towers may appear when the hurricane is about to intensify, which is exactly what Conson did after the hot towers were seen by the TRMM satellite.The TRMM Precipitation Radar 3-D image showed that Conson was already a typhoon at 1550 UTC (1:50 p.m. EDT/1:50 a.m. local Asia/Manila time), which allowed forecasters to reclassify Conson from a tropical storm to a typhoon. TRMM Precipitation Radar revealed that the eye was already well formed indicating that Conson had reached typhoon status at that time.TRMM is a joint mission between NASA and the Japanese space agency JAXA."}

{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_473", "content": "The research, published in It is well known that there are fewer probabilities of a devastating hurricane developing than of a modest one. However, the exact relation between the number of hurricanes and energy released was not known until now. Researchers from the Mathematics Research Centre (CRM) and the Department of Physics of Universitat AutÃ²noma de Barcelona have analysed data corresponding to tropical cyclones (generic name used for hurricanes) which have appeared in different parts of the planet between 1945 and 2007. Scientists have discovered that this relation corresponds to a power-law, a precise mathematical formula cyclones obey in a surprising manner, regardless of where on the planet and when they appear.This fundamental discovery has led researchers to more general conclusions on the behaviour of hurricanes. The first conclusion states that a hurricane's dynamics can be the result of a critical process, therefore making it impossible to predict its intensity. One of the aspects traditionally studied by organisations monitoring the danger of hurricanes is the prediction of their intensity, since this determines which alert and prevention systems are to be used in populated areas. Despite the efforts of scientists and resources invested, until now results have been very poor, although predictions on hurricane trajectory have improved considerably. The fact that hurricanes follow this power-law, as do other natural phenomena where large amounts of energy are released, e.g. earthquakes, questions the ability to predict the evolution of their intensity. In these types of processes, the dynamics behind large hurricanes are the same as those producing tropical storms of less importance and range. The way in which a small storm evolves and transforms into a catastrophic hurricane depends on whether the fluctuations amplifying the storm are stronger than those which tend to dissipate it. However, there is no specific aspect pointing to which will be the dominant fluctuations, since the system at that moment is in a critical situation, i.e. on the verge of either dissipating or growing.The second conclusion of the study is related to the effects of global warming on the behaviour of tropical cyclones: a recent increase in activities in the North Atlantic has shown to follow the same pattern as other high-activity periods in the past. Although there has been a dramatic increase in the number of hurricanes occurring in the North Atlantic since mid-1990s when compared to the period starting in the 1970s, the distribution of hurricanes in the 1950s was similar to today's activity level. Therefore, this increase cannot be explained solely on the basis of climate change. Even so, the research points to the existence of a relation between global warming and the distribution of tropical cyclones. The number of hurricanes is inversely proportional to the energy released, except for the highest values of energy, where the relation is suddenly interrupted. Researchers have observed that the cut-off point where the power-law does not represent the behaviour of hurricanes is influenced by factors such as average sea surface temperature and the El NiÃ±o phenomenon. Thus at a higher temperature, for example, the cut-off point rises to higher energy values.The research was carried out by Ãlvaro Corral, researcher at Mathematics Research Centre (consortium formed by the Institute of Catalan Studies and the Catalan Government, located at the UAB Research Park; CRM is also a CERCA center); Albert OssÃ³, UAB student in Physics; and Dr Josep Enric Llebot, professor at the UAB Department of Physics."}

Scientists will use the data from this six-week field mission to better understand how tropical storms form and develop into major hurricanes. Mission scientists will also be looking at how storms strengthen, weaken and die.\"This is really going to be a game-changing hurricane experiment,\" said Ramesh Kakar, GRIP program scientist at NASA Headquarters in Washington. \"For the first time, scientists will be able to study these storms and the conditions that produce them for up to 20 hours straight. GRIP will provide a sustained, continuous look at hurricane behavior at critical times during their formation and evolution.\"GRIP is led by Kakar and three project scientists: Scott Braun and Gerry Heymsfield of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., and Edward Zipser of the University of Utah in Salt Lake City.Three NASA satellites will play a key role in supplying data about tropical cyclones during the field mission. The Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission, or TRMM, managed by both NASA and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, will provide rainfall estimates and help pinpoint the locations of \"hot towers\" or powerhouse thunderstorms in tropical cyclones. The CloudSat spacecraft, developed and managed by JPL, will provide cloud profiles of storms, which include altitude, temperatures and rainfall intensity. Several instruments onboard NASA's Aqua satellite, including JPL's Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS), will provide infrared, visible and microwave data that reveal such factors as temperature, air pressure, precipitation, cloud ice content, convection and sea surface temperatures.The three NASA aircraft taking part in the mission are a DC-8, WB-57 and a remotely piloted Global Hawk. The DC-8 will fly out of the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport in Florida. The WB-57 will be based at the NASA Johnson Space Center's Ellington Field in Houston. The Global Hawk will be piloted and based from NASA's Dryden Flight Research Center, in Palmdale, Calif., while flying for up to 20 hours in the vicinity of hurricanes in the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico.The aircraft will carry a total of 15 instruments, ranging from an advanced microwave sounder to dropsondes that take measurements as they fall through the atmosphere to the ocean surface. In order to determine how a tropical cyclone will behave, the instruments will analyze many factors including: cloud droplet and aerosol concentrations, air temperature, wind speed and direction in storms and on the ocean's surface, air pressure, humidity, lightning, aerosols, and water vapor. The data also will validate the observations from space.The JPL instruments include the High-Altitude Monolithic Microwave Integrated Circuit Sounding Radiometer (HAMSR), flying aboard the Global Hawk; and the Airborne Precipitation Radar (APR-2), aboard the DC-8. HAMSR is a microwave atmospheric sounder that will be used to infer the 3-D distribution of temperature, water vapor and cloud liquid water in the atmosphere. It operates even in the presence of clouds. APR-2 is a dual-frequency weather radar that will take 3-D images of the precipitation beneath the DC-8 to measure its characteristics. These data will be used to infer rainfall rates, the location of ice and the speed of air updrafts, all of which are part of the atmospheric processes that provide a hurricane's energy.\"It was a lot of hard work to assemble the science team and the payload for the three aircraft for GRIP,\" Kakar said. \"But now that the start of the field experiment is almost here, we can hardly contain our excitement.\"In addition to JPL, several other NASA field centers are involved in the mission, including Goddard; Johnson; Dryden; the Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, Calif.; Langley Research Center in Hampton, Va.; and Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala. Centers provide scientists, instrument teams, project management or aircraft operations.GRIP mission planning is being coordinated with two separate hurricane airborne research campaigns that will be in the field at the same time.

Richard Lane, program director in NSF's Division of Earth Sciences, which funds NCED.\"As the river stage falls and protection diminishes,\" says Lane, \"it becomes a question of how best to distribute this freshwater resource to defend the coast from the movement of oil onshore.\"The answer, Twilley says, lies in the delicate balance of river, coastal and Gulf of Mexico processes \"that must work in concert to benefit the incredible 'ecosystem services' this region provides to the nation.\"Louisiana wetlands \"play a vital role in protecting New Orleans from hurricane damage, providing habitat for wildlife, supporting economically important fisheries, and maintaining water quality,\" says Efi Foufoula-Georgiou, director of NCED.\"We must look at all options for protecting them for the future.\"In addition to his NCED and LSU affiliations, Twilley is the recipient of an NSF rapid response oil spill grant."}

The team's 2-D and 3-D coastal models also will take into account the Gulf of Mexico waves, which may bring the oil closer to the Texas coast.Of chief concern is the possibility that a hurricane moving through the gulf may bring the oil inland. The team hopes to be able to provide support for disaster responders who may need to make emergency management decisions based on the computer models.The primary reason for using Ranger is the massive scale of the data involved in this type of modeling and simulation. The researchers receive satellite imagery of the spill from the university's Center for Space Research and download meteorological data from the National Centers for Environmental Protection every six hours. They combine these data into a 72-hour forecast at 50-meter resolution, which is 10 to 20 times more detailed than many other models being run on the spill.TACC Director Jay Boisseau said this is one of many emergency response efforts for which TACC has provided computational power.\"Ranger gives us the ability to support an immense amount of computational research while reacting quickly to urgent needs such as hurricane predictions, swine flu outbreak scenarios and this oil spill,\" Boisseau said.For each model run, the Advanced Circulation Model for Oceanic, Coastal and Estuarine Waters simulation uses 4,096 cores on Ranger for three hours. The group has been performing between one and four simulations each day.Gordon Wells, program manager for real-time satellite remote sensing at the Center for Space Research, is a technology adviser for state emergency management efforts.

These areas are home to many varieties of fish. To the north, the arc-shaped pattern of land and runoff is associated with the Chandeleur Islands, which are part of the Breton National Wildlife Refuge. This refuge is the second oldest in the United States and is a habitat for dozens of seabird, shorebird and waterfowl species. Oil is reported to have reached the islands on May 6. Eighteen days later, this image shows filaments of oil crossing the island barrier -- which had been heavily eroded by Hurricane Katrina in 2005 -- and entering the Breton and Chandeleur Sounds.The left-hand image contains data from MISR's vertical-viewing camera. It is shown in near-true color, except that data from the instrument's near-infrared band, where vegetation appears bright, have been blended with the instrument's green band to enhance the appearance of vegetation.The Mississippi River delta is located below the image center. The slick is seen approaching the delta from the lower right, and filaments of oil are also apparent farther to the north (towards the top). The oil is made visible by sun reflecting off the sea surface at the same angle from which the instrument is viewing it, a phenomenon known as sunglint. Oil makes the surface look brighter under these viewing conditions than it would if no oil were present. However, other factors can also cause enhanced glint, such as reduced surface wind speed. To separate glint patterns due to oil from these other factors, additional information from MISR's cameras is used in the right-hand image.Previous MISR imagery of the spill shows that the contrast of the oil against the surroundings is enhanced by using a combination of vertical views and oblique-angle views. The right-hand panel was constructed by combining data from several MISR channels. In this false-color view, oil appears in shades of inky blue to black; silt-laden water due to runoff from the Mississippi River shows up as orange, red and violet; and land and clouds appear in shades of cyan.The images cover an area measuring 110 by 119 kilometers (68 by 74 miles).Read more at"}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_479", "content": "Now nearly five years later, a survey of North Carolina kidney dialysis patients by University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Medicine researchers finds that most have not taken the emergency preparedness measures that would enable them to survive a hurricane or any other disaster that disrupts power and water services. North Carolina ranks fourth among the states in hurricane landfalls, behind Florida, Texas and Louisiana.\"End stage kidney disease patients are dependent on medical treatment at regular intervals for their ongoing health, and, as such, are particularly vulnerable to the effects of a disaster. We found that patients on dialysis are largely unprepared for such an event, whether they are forced to stay in their homes or evacuate,\" said Mark Foster, lead author of the study.Foster, a UNC medical student, presented the results June 3 at the annual meeting of the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine in Phoenix. His mentor in the project was Jane Brice, MD, MPH, associate professor of emergency medicine and medical director of Orange County EMS.Dialysis is a treatment for kidney failure. Dialysis filters the blood of harmful wastes, extra salt and water. Patients who need dialysis typically must go around 3 times a week to a dialysis facility that is equipped with dialysis machines and staffed by medical professionals. Dialysis machines require both electricity and sterile water, both of which may be unavailable for several days or even weeks in disaster-impacted areas. If dialysis cannot be provided for an end stage kidney disease patient, then toxic molecules and electrolytes will accumulate that can lead to a number of serious health problems, including death.In the survey, 311 dialysis patients receiving treatment at six regional dialysis centers in central North Carolina answered questions about their demographics, general disaster preparedness, dialysis-specific preparations for \"sheltering in place\" at home, and preparations for a forced evacuation.Both the general disaster preparedness and dialysis-specific preparedness of most respondents was poor, regardless of their sex, race, age, income or level of education.With regard to general disaster preparedness, 58 percent said they had enough bottled water at home to last for three days while 54 percent said they had enough food and water for three days. Forty-eight percent said they had 75 percent of the items on a disaster preparedness checklist recommended by the Department of Homeland Security while 38 percent said they had both food and water for three days and 75 percent of the checklist items. Only 31 percent said they had collected all of these items into a disaster preparation bag or kit, as this checklist recommends.In terms of dialysis-specific preparations, despite annual disaster preparedness education provided by the dialysis facilities, only 57 percent of patients understood what they needed to do for a renal emergency diet and only 6 percent had kayexalate, a drug used to treat increased amounts of potassium in the body, at home. Forty-three percent knew of other dialysis centers where they could get treatment if their current center was out of service and 42 percent said they had sufficient medical records at home with treatment information that they could provide to a new center.The study concludes that most survey respondents were unprepared for a potential disaster and therefore more efforts to address preparedness education techniques are warranted. The study authors note that the unpreparedness found in their study is in all likelihood not unique to North Carolina and is thought to be similar to the level of preparedness found among dialysis patients across the country.In addition to Foster and Brice, authors of the study were Maria Ferris, MD, MPH, PhD, director of UNC Health Care's pediatric renal dialysis program; Stephanie Principe, an undergraduate student at Davidson University; Frances Shofer, PhD, director of research in the Department of Emergency Medicine; and Ronald J. Falk, MD, division chief of nephrology and hypertension and director of the UNC Kidney Center.The study was funded by a training grant from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases."}

The small, targeted science investigations complement NASA's larger research missions. In 2007, the National Research Council recommended that NASA undertake these types of regularly solicited, quick-turnaround projects.This year's selections are all airborne investigations. Future Venture proposals may include small, dedicated spacecraft and instruments flown on other spacecraft.\"I'm thrilled to be able to welcome these new principal investigators into NASA's Earth Venture series,\" said Edward Weiler, associate administrator of the agency's Science Mission Directorate in Washington. \"These missions are considered a 'tier 1' priority in the National Research Council's Earth Science decadal survey. With this selection, NASA moves ahead into this exciting type of scientific endeavor.\"The missions will be funded during the next five years at a total cost of not more than $30 million each. The cost includes initial development and deployment through analysis of data. Approximately $10 million was provided through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act toward the maximum $150 million funding ceiling for the missions.Six NASA centers, 22 educational institutions, nine U.S. or international government agencies and three industrial partners are involved in these missions. The five missions were selected from 35 proposals.The selected missions are:1. Carbon in Arctic Reservoirs Vulnerability Experiment. Principal Investigator Charles Miller, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif.The release and absorption of carbon from Arctic ecosystems and its response to climate change are not well known because of a lack of detailed measurements. This investigation will collect an integrated set of data that will provide unprecedented experimental insights into Arctic carbon cycling, especially the release of important greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane. Instruments will be flown on a Twin Otter aircraft to produce the first simultaneous measurements of surface characteristics that control carbon emissions and key atmospheric gases.2. Airborne Microwave Observatory of Subcanopy and Subsurface. Principal Investigator Mahta Moghaddam, University of MichiganNorth American ecosystems are critical components of the global exchange of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide and other gases within the atmosphere. To better understand the size of this exchange on a continental scale, this investigation addresses the uncertainties in existing estimates by measuring soil moisture in the root zone of representative regions of major North American ecosystems. Investigators will use NASA's Gulfstream-III aircraft to fly synthetic aperture radar that can penetrate vegetation and soil to depths of several feet.3. Airborne Tropical Tropopause Experiment. Principal Investigator Eric Jensen, NASA's Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, Calif.Water vapor in the stratosphere has a large impact on Earth's climate, the ozone layer and how much solar energy Earth retains. To improve our understanding of the processes that control the flow of atmospheric gases into this region, investigators will launch four airborne campaigns with NASA's Global Hawk remotely piloted aerial systems. The flights will study chemical and physical processes at different times of year from bases in California, Guam, Hawaii and Australia.4. Deriving Information on Surface Conditions from Column and Vertically Resolved Observations Relevant to Air Quality. Principal Investigator James Crawford, NASA's Langley Research Center in Hampton, Va.Satellites can measure air quality factors like aerosols and ozone-producing gases in an entire column of atmosphere below the spacecraft, but distinguishing the concentrations at the level where people live is a challenge. This investigation will provide integrated data of airborne, surface and satellite observations, taken at the same time, to study air quality as it evolves throughout the day. NASA's B-200 and P-3B research aircraft will fly together to sample a column of the atmosphere over instrumented ground stations.5. Hurricane and Severe Storm Sentinel. Principal Investigator Scott Braun, NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md.The prediction of the intensity of hurricanes is not as reliable as predictions of the location of hurricane landfall, in large part because of our poor understanding of the processes involved in intensity change. This investigation focuses on studying hurricanes in the Atlantic Ocean basin using two NASA Global Hawks flying high above the storms for up to 30 hours. The Hawks will deploy from NASA's Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia during the 2012 to 2014 Atlantic hurricane seasons.\"These new investigations, in concert with NASA's Earth-observing satellite capabilities, will provide unique new data sets that identify and characterize important phenomena, detect changes in the Earth system and lead to improvements in computer modeling of the Earth system,\" said Jack Kaye, associate director for research of NASA's Earth Science Division in the Science Mission Directorate.Langley manages the Earth System Pathfinder program for the Science Mission Directorate. The missions in this program provide an innovative approach to address Earth science research with periodic windows of opportunity to accommodate new scientific priorities."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_481", "content": "Associate Scholar Scientist Tim LaRow and his colleagues at FSU's Center for Ocean-Atmospheric Prediction Studies (COAPS) say there will be an average of 17 named storms with 10 of those storms developing into hurricanes in the Atlantic this season, which begins June 1, and runs through Nov. 30. The historical seasonal average is 11 tropical storms with six of them becoming hurricanes.\"It looks like it will be a very busy season, and it only takes one hurricane making landfall to have devastating effects,\" LaRow said. \"The predicted high number of tropical systems means there is an increased chance that the eastern United States or Gulf Coast will see a landfall this year.\"The COAPS model, unveiled just last year, is one of only a handful of numerical models in the world being used to study seasonal hurricane activity, and it has already outperformed many other models. The model uses the university's high-performance computer to synthesize massive amounts of information including atmospheric, ocean and land data. A key component of the COAPS model is the use of predicted sea surface temperatures.The 2009 forecast, the model's first, was on target: It predicted a below-average season, with a mean of eight named storms with four of them developing into hurricanes. There were nine named storms with three that became hurricanes.The model's 2009 forecast, plus its hindcasts of the previous 14 hurricane seasons -- that's when the data that existed prior to each season is plugged into the model to reforecast the season and then compared to what actually occurred -- really show the model's precision. From 1995 to 2009, the model predicted a mean of 13.7 named storms of which a mean of 7.8 were hurricanes. In reality, the average during this period was 13.8 named storms with a mean of 7.9 hurricanes.How the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico will affect the development of tropical storms this year is a question that scientists are still trying to figure out, LaRow said. The oil on the ocean surface can diminish the amount of surface evaporation, which would lead to local increased ocean temperatures near the surface, but LaRow said he's made no adjustments to the model to account for the oil that continues to gush from an underwater well.\"The oil spill will probably have little influence on the hurricane season, but we don't know for sure since this spill is unprecedented,\" he said. \"It's uncertain how exactly the atmospheric and oceanic conditions might change if the spill continues to grow.\"COAPS researchers spent about five years developing and assessing the numerical model before putting it to the test with its first real-time forecast last year. Numerical models require major computing resources in order to make trillions of calculations using the equations of motion along with the best physical understanding of the atmosphere. By contrast, statistical models, such as the one that produces Colorado State University's annual forecast, use statistical relationships between oceanic and atmospheric variables to make a forecast.COAPS received a $6.2 million, five-year grant from NOAA in 2006 that has been used, in part, to support the development of the model."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_482", "content": "Across the entire Atlantic Basin for the six-month season, which begins June 1, NOAA is projecting a 70 percent probability of the following ranges:\"If this outlook holds true, this season could be one of the more active on record,\" said Jane Lubchenco, Ph.D., under secretary of commerce for oceans and atmosphere and NOAA administrator. \"The greater likelihood of storms brings an increased risk of a landfall. In short, we urge everyone to be prepared.\"The outlook ranges exceed the seasonal average of 11 named storms, six hurricanes and two major hurricanes. Expected factors supporting this outlook are:\"The main uncertainty in this outlook is how much above normal the season will be. Whether or not we approach the high end of the predicted ranges depends partly on whether or not La NiÃ±a develops this summer,\" said Gerry Bell, Ph.D., lead seasonal hurricane forecaster at NOAA's Climate Prediction Center. \"At present we are in a neutral state, but conditions are becoming increasingly favorable for La NiÃ±a to develop.\"\"FEMA is working across the administration and with our state and local partners to ensure we're prepared for hurricane season,\" said FEMA Administrator Craig Fugate. \"But we can only be as prepared as the public, so it's important that families and businesses in coastal communities take steps now to be ready. These include developing a communications plan, putting together a kit, and staying informed of the latest forecasts and local emergency plans. You can't control when a hurricane or other emergency may happen, but you can make sure you're ready.\"The president recently designated May 23-29, 2010, as National Hurricane Preparedness Week. NOAA and FEMA encourage those living in hurricane-prone states to use this time to review their overall preparedness. More information on individual and family preparedness can be found at NOAA scientists will continue to monitor evolving conditions in the tropics and will issue an updated hurricane outlook in early August, just prior to what is historically the peak period for hurricane activity."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_483", "content": "Allowing for forecast uncertainties, seasonal hurricane forecasters estimate a 70 percent chance of 9 to 15 named storms, which includes 4 to 8 hurricanes, of which 1 to 3 are expected to become major hurricanes (category 3, 4 or 5 on the Saffir-Simpson scale).An average Eastern Pacific hurricane season produces 15 to 16 named storms, with nine becoming hurricanes and four to five becoming major hurricanes. The Eastern Pacific hurricane season runs from May 15 through Nov. 30, with peak activity from July through September.The main climate factors influencing this year's Eastern Pacific outlook are the atmospheric conditions that have decreased hurricane activity over the Eastern Pacific Ocean since 1995 -- and the fact that El NiÃ±o has faded.\"La NiÃ±a is becoming increasingly likely, which further raises the chance of a below-normal season for the Eastern Pacific region,\" said Gerry Bell, Ph.D., lead seasonal hurricane forecaster at NOAA's Climate Prediction Center.The outlook is a general guide to the overall seasonal hurricane activity. It does not predict whether, where or when any of these storms may hit land.Eastern Pacific tropical storms most often track westward over open waters, sometimes reaching Hawaii and beyond. However, some occasionally head toward the northeast and may bring rainfall to the arid southwestern United States during the summer months. Also, during any given season, two to three tropical storms can affect western Mexico or Central America. Residents, businesses and government agencies of coastal and near-coastal regions should always prepare prior to each and every hurricane season regardless of the seasonal hurricane outlook."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_484", "content": "These pipelines could crack or rupture unless they are buried or their supporting foundations are built to withstand these hurricane-induced currents. \"Major oil leaks from damaged pipelines could have irreversible impacts on the ocean environment,\" the researchers warn in their study, to be published on 10 June in With the official start of hurricane season approaching on June 1, news reports about the Deep Horizon oil spill that began fouling the Gulf last month have raised questions about how a hurricane might complicate the unfolding disaster.A hurricane might also create its own spills, the new research indicates. The storms' powerful winds can raise waves 20 meters (66 feet) or more above the ocean surface. But their effects underwater are little known, although signs of seafloor damage have showed up after some hurricanes.Based on unique measurements taken directly under a powerful hurricane, the new study's calculations are the first to show that hurricanes propel underwater currents with enough oomph to dig up the seabed, potentially creating underwater mudslides and damaging pipes or other equipment resting on the bottom.At least 50,000 kilometers (31,000 miles) of pipelines reportedly snake across the seafloor of the Gulf of Mexico. Damage to these pipelines can be difficult to detect if it causes only smaller leaks, rather than a catastrophic break, the researchers say. Repairing underwater pipes can cost more than fixing the offshore oil drilling platforms themselves, making it all the more important to prevent damage to pipelines in the first place.The researchers, at the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory at Stennis Space Center, Mississippi, got an unprecedented view of a hurricane when Hurricane Ivan, a category-4 storm, crossed the Gulf of Mexico in 2004. The eye of the storm passed over a network of sensors on the ocean floor, put in place to monitor currents along the continental shelf in the Gulf.The research team found that strong currents along the sea floor pushed and pulled on the seabed, scouring its surface. \"Usually you only see this in very shallow water, where waves break on the beach, stirring up sand,\" says David Wang, co-author of the study. \"In hurricanes, the much bigger waves can stir up the seafloor all the way down to 90 meters [300 feet].\"Ivan's waves on the surface created powerful currents that dug up the seafloor. Acoustic measurements using sound waves showed that these currents lofted a lot of sediments, which clouded the water up to 25 meters (82 feet) above the seafloor. The team's seafloor sensors tracking the pressure underwater experienced a big increase, as well. This showed that the ground was washed away beneath the sensors, causing them to sink into a lower, higher-pressure zone.Using a computer model of wave-induced current stresses, the team estimated how powerful currents would need to be for forces they exert at the sea floor to exceed a \"critical force\" that triggers sediment suspensions and could lead to underwater mudslides.According to these estimates, hurricanes considerably weaker than Ivan, which was category-4, could still tear up the seafloor, causing significant damage as deep as 90 meters.The researchers were surprised by how long the destructive currents persisted after Hurricane Ivan passed by. \"The stress on the sea floor lasted nearly a week,\" says Hemantha Wijesekera, lead author of the study. \"It doesn't go away, even after the hurricane passes.\"The researchers say they're not sure what strengths of forces underwater oil pipelines are built to withstand. However, \"hurricane stress is quite large, so the oil industry better pay attention,\" Wijesekera says.The Office of Naval Research funded this study."}

Had that same storm struck 30 miles farther south, it could easily have caused $100 billion in damage. Had it struck that location as a Category 4 storm, like Carla, the results would have been catastrophic.\"The new report comes from an ongoing two-year study commissioned from SSPEED in 2009 by the nonprofit Houston Endowment. SSPEED has assembled a team of more than a dozen leading experts from Rice University, the University of Texas at Austin, Texas A&M University, the University of Houston, Texas Southern University and several other institutions to examine flood risks, evacuation readiness, industrial vulnerability and both structural and nonstructural approaches for mitigating storm impact.SSPEED's report indicates:Bedient said one need look no further than the Houston Ship Channel to get a clear sense of the region's vulnerability. The ship channel is home to one of the nation's busiest ports and about one-quarter of U.S. refineries. The Coast Guard estimates a one-month closure of a major port like Houston would cost the national economy $60 billion.Despite this, government regulations require dikes and levees that can protect ship channel facilities against only the 100-year flood of 14-15 feet. Bedient said that based upon results from supercomputer models at the University of Texas, Austin, Ike could have caused a 20- to 25-foot storm surge along the ship channel if it had struck about 30 miles farther south.\"Our team is taking an in-depth, scientific look at structural proposals like the Ike Dike and other dike solutions, as well as nonstructural proposals related to land use,\" said Rice's Jim Blackburn, professor in the practice of environmental law and co-author of the new report. \"Our work so far has revealed a number of different structural and nonstructural solutions. There are dozens of communities along the coast, and each is unique in some way. We are attempting to identify the most cost-effective and environmentally acceptable methods of providing a basic level of protection, including both structural barriers and nonstructural approaches that take advantage of natural features like barrier islands and storm-surge storage in wetlands.\"Blackburn said SSPEED's goal is to propose policy options to decision makers at the state, local and federal level with an unbiased assessment of the economic and environmental costs and benefits of all approaches so that an informed decision on the future of the region can be made.\"And make no mistake about it -- the solutions that are chosen to deal with this flood-surge problem will determine the landscape of the future for the upper Texas coast,\" Blackburn said."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_486", "content": "The research reveals how chemical concentrations across coastal areas varied, but within New Orleans elevated concentrations of lead, arsenic and other chemicals were found, particularly in the most disadvantaged areas of the city following Hurricane Katrina. The team also discovered how airborne contaminants known to pose health risks, were released through demolition projects during the city-wide cleanup operation.\"While evidence suggests that hurricanes may increase in intensity, resulting in even greater economic damage in the future, social and cultural factors are also important aspects to consider for the future impact of hurricanes,\" said Dr. Bill Benson of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA). \"It is important that higher priority is given to understanding social factors and demographic patterns pertaining to continued development along our nation's coastline.\"Hurricane Katrina, which hit New Orleans in August 2005, remains one of the costliest and deadliest hurricane ever to hit the United States. When the hurricane hit land, the resulting surge extended six miles inland, breaching the levees of New Orleans and causing flooding to 80 percent of the city to depths of six meters.In human terms Katrina resulted in 1,800 confirmed fatalities spread over six states with at least 700 people confirmed missing and an additional one million people displaced. Katrina-related damage is estimated to exceed $84 billion, making it the most expensive natural disaster in US history. Yet it is the indirect environmental impact that continues to pose a risk to the population of New Orleans.To discover the impact of chemical contamination Dr. George Cobb from Texas Tech University led a team to study 128 sampling sites from across the city, combining their findings with data sets generated by Dr. Burton Suedel and co-workers with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Maps were then compiled from the resulting data to reveal chemical distribution across the city.Elevated concentrations of arsenic and lead were demonstrated to exist throughout New Orleans with the highest concentrations observed in soils from the poorer sections of the city. The team also discovered that lead concentrations exceed the regulatory threshold for safety, with the highest concentrations found in the oldest parts of the city. Lead in soil poses a significant risk to residents who returned to their homes following the evacuation, especially children.While the team's findings indicated that levels of lead frequently exceed regulatory thresholds, further research showed that many of the contaminants were present in high concentrations before the storm season and that lead may have posed a significant risk to New Orleans residents for years before Hurricane Katrina.The results also revealed elevated concentrations of arsenic in surface soils and flood sediments across New Orleans, caused by sediment deposition or from flooded building materials.\"Our evaluation of contaminants in New Orleans was critical in determining whether storm surges and resultant flooding altered chemical concentrations or distribution,\" concluded Cobb. \"Our results show how long-term human health consequences in New Orleans are difficult to attribute to chemical deposition or redistribution by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, yet reveal how chemical contamination is a historical problem for old cites in the U.S. Our results and the data from coastal ecosystems reveal the value of long-term monitoring programs to establish baseline concentrations and distributions of contaminants in the environment.\""}

While the booms are moved, oil can move closer to the coastline.\"It's not easy to re-route these huge vessels,\" Hales said. \"Traffic is still moving in and out of the Port of New Orleans because the heaviest slicks haven't reached there yet.\"However, he added that smaller recreational boats and those used for commercial fishing and touring cannot operate in the slick because they will draw oil-contaminated water into their engines.\"The old paddleboats based in the Mississippi Delta will have to cease operations, too.\"It's going to be over for recreational and commercial fishing within the next few weeks if the spill is not stopped,\" Hales said. \"Crude oil is like tar. The most efficient thing to do would be to burn the oil, since many of the dispersion agents in use are extremely toxic. It's either that, or let it spread to the beaches. Of course, a nasty cloud would be produced from the burning, which could also affect air quality and tourism throughout the Gulf.\"Hales said it is important to remember that New Orleans is still down 200,000 to 250,000 residents in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. The impending oil catastrophe could lead to further flight as jobs are lost and people default on their businesses and homes.Further north and east, Tennessee is reeling from heavy flooding. Hales said closures of Interstate 24, a major route for transportation of products from the south to northern Midwest states like Wisconsin and Michigan, have had a major impact.\"I would estimate that $3 to $5 million per day in freight operations have been lost because of closures on 24,\" Hales said. \"Combined with severe cold weather in the south earlier this year, you have to expect prices to increase on products like orange juice coming out of Florida.\"While the volcano in Iceland has grown more active in the last four days, Hales said most of the summer goods transported by air made it into the United States and Europe before the huge ash cloud interrupted passenger and freight flights. However, the airspace over Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland was closed Monday because of concerns that ash would drift into the area.Hales said the airlines are estimating that the ash cloud caused $2 billion in passenger traffic interruption, but the interruption in airfreight traffic was probably two to three times that amount. Hales said there is a robust high tech industry in Ireland and Northern Europe that have to cope with another two to three days of shipping time. That's a huge amount of time when the high tech industry rolls out new products every three to six months."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_488", "content": "According to comprehensive research using government incident databases, about 8 million gallons of petroleum releases were reported as a result of Katrina hitting the U.S. Gulf coast in 2005, nearly 75 percent of the total volume of the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska. The releases were largely due to storage tank failure and the shut down and restart of production processes. Storm surge floods were the primary cause, but some incidents occurred as a result of hurricane and tropical storm strength winds where no surge was present, according to the authors.The study appears in the April issue of the journal The authors include consultant Nicholas Santella, Laura Steinberg of Syracuse University, and Hatice Sengul of the Turkish Scientific and Technological Research Council. Ten onshore releases of petroleum products were greater than 10,000 gallons each, primarily made up of crude oil that leaked from storage tanks. Fewer and smaller releases were reported from chemical and manufacturing industries handling hazardous materials. Of the releases from onshore facilities and storage tanks, 76 percent were petroleum, 18 percent were chemicals and six percent were natural gas. Many refineries and other facilities shut down in anticipation of large storms to minimize damage and prevent process upsets and are required to do so for safety purposes. However, shutdowns and restarts have the disadvantage of leading to potentially large emissions of volatile organic compounds, particulate matter, and other chemicals.\"More attention should be given to planning for shutdowns, including coordination with government entities responsible for evacuation, and to plant startup after an emergency shutdown in order to minimize burning off excess gas by flaring and other releases,\" according to the authors. For example, storage tanks can be filled with water and other steps can be taken to mitigate damage during severe storms and floods.\"Where large releases do occur, in-depth analysis by each plant of mechanism of failure and contributing factors should be required,\" the authors add. Significant factors slowing response to the Katrina damage included indirect disruptions, such as displacement of workers, loss of electricity and communication systems, and difficulty acquiring supplies and contractors for operations and reconstruction. Of industrial facilities responding to a survey in the study, 55 percent experienced indirect disruptions, far more than had environmental releases of hazardous materials, indicating improved risk-based facility design and improved prevention and response planning may be warranted.\"Chemical accident prevention and emergency response regulations in the US and elsewhere generally do not address the threat of natural hazards directly. While many companies are proactive in taking steps to mitigate natural hazard risk, others may make only the minimum effort require by statute,\" the authors conclude. The study is the first to comprehensively analyze the incidence and causes of releases from all types of onshore industrial facilities as a result of Hurricane Katrina. The analysis relies on the key incident reporting databases of the National Response Center (NRC) Incident Reporting Information System (IRIS) administered by the U.S. Coast Guard. In addition, interviews and data were obtained from federal and Gulf state environmental agencies, energy and chemical associations, public accounts of particular incidents, and a small industry survey."}

NASA's GOES Project also creates some of the GOES satellite images and GOES satellite imagery animations. NOAA manages the operational environmental satellite program and establishes requirements, provides all funding and distributes environmental satellite data for the United States.\"It is exciting to think that we are now putting into service the best satellites this country has to offer,\" said Andre' Dress, GOES N-P NASA Deputy Project Manager, at Goddard. \"We are really looking forward to see the increase in performance over the older satellites and the improvements in weather prediction.\"There are two GOES satellites that cover weather conditions in the U.S. and they are positioned over the eastern and western U.S. The satellite in the GOES EAST position covers weather on the eastern side of the continental U.S., including the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico. The GOES WEST position covers the western half of the U.S. and the Eastern Pacific Ocean.GOES-13 has now replaced GOES-12, which NOAA is shifting in orbit to provide coverage for South America, as part of the Global Earth Observing System of Systems, or GEOSS. GOES-11 continues to occupy the GOES-WEST position.Initially known as the GOES-N satellite, it was renamed GOES-13 when it achieved geosynchronous orbit. It was launched from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Fla. at 6:11 p.m. EDT on May 24, 2006 aboard a Boeing Delta IV rocket.GOES-13 is the first of three new NOAA geostationary environmental satellites. The other two in the new series are GOES-14, launched in June 2009 and now in orbital storage, and GOES-15, launched on March 4, 2010, and undergoing tests before completing its \"check-out\" phase, scheduled to be complete in August 2010.Since the first GOES launch in 1974, these satellites have supplied the data critical for fast, accurate weather forecasts and warnings. The newer GOES series of satellites help relay distress signals from emergency beacons, and are equipped to monitor solar activity, which can impact billions of dollars worth of government and commercial assets in space and on the ground.NOAA understands and predicts changes in the Earth's environment, from the depths of the ocean to the surface of the sun, and conserves and manages our coastal and marine resources.For more information about NASA's GOES Program visit:"}

The studies were designed to create more effective hurricane communication among forecasters, government officials, media representatives and ultimately the public, including insights into why some residents choose to evacuate while others do not.Final results of the project will be released in April and will include \"best practices\" for improving risk communication in coastal communities, focusing on Louisiana parishes east of the Mississippi.LSU Department of Communication Studies Professor and Chair Renee Edwards leads the HPIP project.

{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_491", "content": "The team used both cyclone and climate models to study the frequency and distribution of tropical cyclones (also known as hurricanes or typhoons) during the Pliocene epoch, a period three to five million years ago when temperatures were up to four degrees Celsius warmer than today.The team found that there were twice as many tropical cyclones during this period, that they lasted two to three days longer on average than they do now, and that, unlike today, they occurred across the entire tropical Pacific Ocean.\"The Pliocene is the best analog we have in the past for what could happen in our future,\" said Christopher Brierley, a Yale postdoctoral associate and an author of the study. \"We wondered whether all these storms could have contributed to the warmer climate.\"In fact, the team discovered a positive feedback cycle between tropical cyclones and upper-ocean circulation in the Pacific that explains the increase in storms and appears to have led to permanent El NiÃ±o-like conditions.Today, cold water originating off the coasts of California and Chile skirts around the region of tropical cyclone activity on its way to the Equator, where it results in a \"cold tongue\" that stretches west off the coast of South America. During the Pliocene, however, the team found that this cold water could not avoid being hit by one of the many tropical cyclones, which would churn up and mix warmer water into it. This warming at the Equator led to changes in the atmosphere that in turn created more tropical storms -- and the cycle would repeat.The team hopes to study how much mixing could result from tropical cyclones in today's ocean waters -- something that is hard to incorporate in global climate models, said Alexey Fedorov, an associate professor at Yale and lead author of the paper.Fedorov cautioned that there is not necessarily a direct link between what happened during the Pliocene and what might happen in the future, as the team's results for this epoch differed in many respects from current projections for future global warming. For example, the existing consensus is that, while the number of intense hurricanes will increase, the overall number will actually decrease.\"However, unless we understand the causes of these differences, we will not be sure whether our projections are correct,\" Fedorov said. \"Changes in the frequency and distribution of these storms could be a significant component of future climate conditions.\"Other authors of this paper include Kerry Emanuel of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.Funding for this study was provided by the National Science Foundation, the Department of Energy Office of Science, and the David and Lucile Packard Foundation."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_492", "content": "\"What is missing from the tragedy of disaster, and our response to it, is the recognition that disasters are preventable, that it is within the power of societies and communities to prevent or at least minimize the devastation disasters cause,\" said Kathleen Tierney, director of CU-Boulder's Natural Hazards Center. \"We mourn the human toll of disasters, but collectively we do far too little to minimize their impacts.\"The pervasive view of disasters is that they are inevitable, said Tierney, who also is a professor of sociology. They are viewed as acts of God, acts of nature or just random, tragic events.But while earthquakes are inevitable in earthquake zones, and hurricanes and tornadoes are inevitable under certain weather conditions -- \"there are no inevitable disasters,\" she said. \"There is no such thing as a natural disaster.\"The city of Port-au-Prince increased in size and population with virtually no attention given to the fact that it's in a seismic area, located on a boundary between two continental plates, she said. No effort was made to make buildings seismic-resistant. No restrictions were placed on where or how homes were built. Many homes were built on hillsides susceptible to landslides.All of these conditions are either tied to or made worse by the extreme poverty in Haiti, Tierney said. Eighty percent of the population lives in poverty and the country was still recovering from four hurricanes that hit the country in 2008 when this year's earthquake struck.\"The Haiti government can't provide for daily needs, much less a disaster,\" Tierney said.But there are steps that can and should be taken now to make Haiti more disaster-resistant, she said, noting that the country faces continued risks from aftershocks, landslides and another hurricane season starting in June. She hopes that the international donor community will put preventive measures in place as a condition of providing disaster assistance.For example, hillsides in Haiti should not be developed and the badly damaged port of Port-au-Prince should be rebuilt to standards that will enable it to withstand the next earthquake and the next hurricane, she said. Implementation of good emergency management practices and the engagement of Haitian communities in planning for future disasters also is essential.\"Societies create disasters of the future by decisions they make or don't make -- by how they live with nature,\" Tierney said.Fields such as urban planning provide sound insights on land-use and urban development strategies that can keep people, buildings and infrastructure out of harm's way, she said. Architects and engineers understand how to employ hazard-resistant design and construction practices. Building codes can prevent structures from collapsing.It also is known how to design emergency management systems that will perform effectively when disaster strikes and how to educate people in ways that will help protect them from natural and technological hazards, she said. Laws, ordinances and other measures also can save lives, protect property and speed the recovery process after disasters.\"We do not lack the knowledge to prevent disasters,\" Tierney said. \"What we lack is the foresight and political will to do so. The United States and other countries have not yet learned the lesson that disasters are preventable and that today's investments in prevention reduce tomorrow's suffering.\"The Natural Hazards Center is part of CU-Boulder's Institute of Behavioral Science and is funded by a consortium of agencies including the National Science Foundation and FEMA.

The questionnaire evaluated whom the participants perceived to be the victims based on measures like gender, race and socioeconomic status. The results showed that participants generally thought people impacted by Hurricane Katrina were black and lower class.\"What we wanted to do was see how perceptions of victims of Hurricane Katrina would interact with things like racism,\" Saucier said. \"We wanted to look at how much the participants felt that the victims may have been to blame for their own situation in Katrina.\"The researchers measured differences in the participants, including their levels of conservatism, empathy and racism. The findings showed that when recalling victims of Hurricane Katrina, participants who were less racist thought the victims did not receive adequate help from the government. Participants who were more racist thought the victims received adequate government assistance and were at fault for their situation. The survey also asked questions that measured whether the participants thought the victims had enough time to evacuate and whether they had enough resources to get out before the hurricane hit.\"We asked the participants to make personality attributions about individuals, such as whether they thought the victims were lazy, stupid, sinful or unlucky,\" Saucier said. \"If they said they were lazy, stupid or sinful, they were putting more blame on the victims for the situation. If they said they were unlucky, they took away the blame.\"The results suggest that perceptions of the victims and the Hurricane Katrina situation depended on the participants' individual differences, including their levels of racism. Negative perceptions and placing blame on the victims were generally associated with the participants' perceptions that the situation was less of an emergency and that the victims needed less help.Saucier said although the findings can't fix what happened to the victims, the study helps show how people interpret the situation. He said when something negative happens, people often evaluate the situation and see whether they can fix it, and sometimes they avoid the situation by blaming the victim.The researchers study the effects of group membership, and groups can be categorized in various ways, including by gender, race and socioeconomic status. Studies show there are specific factors that cause someone to help a member of their own group more than others. In helping situations, discrimination is often expressed by not giving help to those of a different group than the helper, Saucier said.\"Rather than doing something bad, the person who chooses not to help the out-group member fails to do something good,\" Saucier said. \"I think this illustrates the complexity of how prejudice is expressed in contemporary society despite the social norms that usually serve to suppress the expression of prejudice.\"Saucier said discrimination is often expressed only when other factors are present that would justify the action and rationalize it as something other than an expression of prejudice. Factors that contribute to the justification of not helping someone include the time it would take to help; the risk, effort, difficulty and financial cost involved; the distance between the potential helper and the person needing help; the level of emergency and the ambiguity of the helping situation.The researchers said the Hurricane Katrina situation had several elements that studies show trigger acts of discrimination, such as a high cost of help, a high level of emergency and a large amount of time and effort required to help. The researchers are exploring other helping situations and how other group memberships affect the helping response.\"We want to examine how the perception of someone that you're going to be helping is going to affect your perception of how much help they need and how much help you'll want to give,\" Saucier said.Though it's unlikely that researchers can fix the beliefs and attitudes that lead to discrimination, studies are being done to try to change the behavior that is expressed when related to discrimination, Saucier said.The researchers' findings on Hurricane Katrina victims are included in a chapter about discrimination against out-group members in helping situations in \"The Psychology of Prosocial Behavior: Group processes, intergroup relations and helping,\" published in September 2009."}

The study supplements information gathered from a previous three year deployment.The mooring data suggest the LC and LCEs that dominate upper-layer circulation in the Eastern GOM also influence the deeper currents in the Eastern GOM.Dr. Lugo-Fernandez noted that a method to transmit significant energy in the form of heat to deep water in the GOM during the 2005 hurricane season was observed during this study. As sea levels rise near the center of tropical storms, the resulting higher pressure causes a small but measurable increase in temperature at all water depths.

This degradation was fully expected, as the spin mechanism was designed to last about 5 years.After experiencing further difficulties over the weekend, the antenna stopped spinning early today, Nov. 23. The QuikScat spacecraft and scatterometer instrument themselves remain in otherwise good health. Should engineers be unable to restart the antenna, QuikScat will be unable to continue its primary science mission, as the antenna spin is necessary to estimate wind speed and direction and form the wide data swath necessary to obtain nearly global sampling.Over the coming days, NASA managers will review contingency plans for restarting the antenna and assess options for using the mission in its present degraded state to advance Earth system science in the event the antenna cannot be restarted. For example, degraded scatterometer measurements from QuikScat can still be useful for cross-calibrating the mission's climate data record with measurements from other scatterometers, including the operational EUMETSAT ASCAT instrument, India's recently launched Oceansat-2 and a planned Chinese scatterometer. Specific operational forecasting applications such as polar ice measurements and limited hurricane observations may also be supportable.By any measure of success, the 10-year-old QuikScat mission is a unique national resource that has achieved and far surpassed its science objectives. Designed for a two-year lifetime, QuikScat has been used around the globe by the world's operational meteorological agencies to improve weather forecasts and identify the location, size and strength of hurricanes and other storms in the open ocean. The mission has also provided critical information for monitoring, modeling, forecasting and researching our atmosphere, ocean and climate.The tremendous success of QuikScat led the National Research Council, in its 2007 decadal survey report for Earth science, to recommend that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration develop an operational version of QuikScat, called the Extended Ocean Vector Winds Mission (XOVWM).More information on QuikScat is online at:"}

{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_500", "content": "The information provided by their computer models has the potential to save utilities substantial amounts of money, savings that can then be passed on to customers, the researchers say. In addition, appropriate crew levels and placements can help facilitate rapid restoration of power after the storm.The study was a collaborative effort involving Seth Guikema, an assistant professor of geography and environmental engineering at Johns Hopkins and formerly of Texas A&M; Steven Quiring, an assistant professor of geography at Texas A&M; and Seung-Ryong Han, who was Guikema's doctoral student at Texas A&M and is now based at Korea University. Their work, which was funded by a Gulf Coast utility company that wishes to remain anonymous, is published in the current issue of the journal The research focused on two common challenges. When a hurricane is approaching, an electric power provider must decide how many repair crews to request from other utilities, a decision that may cost the provider millions of dollars. The utility also must decide where to locate these crews within its service areas to enable fast and efficient restoration of service after the hurricane ends. Having accurate estimates, prior to the storm's arrival, of how many outages will exist and where they will occur will allow utilities to better plan their crew requests and crew locations, the researchers say.What makes the research team's computational approach unique and increases its accuracy, Guikema and Quiring say, is the combination of more detailed information about the storm, the area it is impacting and the power system of the area, together with more appropriate statistical models.\"If the power company overestimates, it has spent a lot of unnecessary money,\" Quiring said. \"If it underestimates, the time needed to restore power can take several extra days or longer, which is unacceptable to them and the people they serve. So these companies need the best estimates possible, and we think this study can help them make the best possible informed decision.\"In addition, more accurate models \"provide a much better basis for preparing for restoring power after the storm,\" Guikema said, adding that \"the goal is to restore power faster and save customers money.\"In developing their computer model, the researchers looked at damage data from five hurricanes: Dennis (1995), Danny (1997), Georges (1998), Ivan (2004) and Katrina (2005). In the areas studied, Ivan created 13,500 power outages; Katrina, more than 10,000; Dennis, about 4,800; Georges, 1,075; and Danny, 620.For the worst of these storms, some customers were without power for up to 11 days. The research team collected information about the locations of outages in these past hurricanes, with an outage defined as permanent loss of power to a set of customers due to activation of a protective device in the power system.The researchers also included information about the power system in each area (poles, transformers, etc.), hurricane wind speeds, wetness of the soil, long-term average precipitation, the land use, local topography and other related factors. This data was then used to train and validate a statistical regression model called a Generalized Additive Model, a particular form of model that can account for nonlinear relationships between the variables."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_501", "content": "\"Looking for something like hurricane records in seismology doesn't occur to anybody,\" said Carl Ebeling, of Northwestern University in Evanston, who is presenting his research at the annual meeting of the Geological Society of America in Portland, Oregon. \"It's a strange and wondrous combination.\"The research is attempting to address a long-standing debate about whether the warming of sea-surface waters as a result of climate change is producing more frequent or more powerful hurricanes in the North Atlantic. It's a tough question to answer.Before satellite observations began in the 1960s, weather monitoring was spotty. Ships, planes, and land-based monitoring stations probably missed some hurricanes, which tend to last for about a week or so, Ebeling said. This type of uncertainty poses a problem for scientists, who can't identify trends until they know what the actual numbers were.To fill in the historical blanks, Ebeling and colleague Seth Stein are looking to seismic noise, an ever-present background signal that bathes the surface of the Earth. Seismic noise derives its energy from the atmosphere and then gets transmitted through the oceans into the solid earth, where it travels as waves. Seismometers record the noise as very low-amplitude wiggle patterns with much larger, obvious signals that come from earthquakes. Subtle changes in seismic noise frequency and amplitude have long been ignored.Ebeling and Stein analyzed digital seismograms dating back to the early 90s from two monitoring stations: one in Harvard, Mass., and one in San Juan, Puerto Rico. For this study, the researchers looked at seismograms recorded during known hurricanes in an attempt to see whether patterns produced during hurricanes look predictably different from patterns produced during regular storms or when there are no storms at all.Their preliminary results suggest that hurricanes do indeed produce recognizable patterns, and the waves generated by hurricanes travel large distances. The Harvard station recorded signals from Hurricane Andrew more than a thousand kilometers away.\"There's definitely something there that shows this can be workable,\" Ebeling said. \"This is something new and interesting.\"At least one major hurdle remains before scientists will be able to pull together a complete hurricane history out of the seismic records. For most of the 20th century, seismograms recorded data on rolls of paper. Those records, which contain hundreds of thousands of hours of data, will need to be digitized. Ebeling is looking for an efficient way to do that."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_502", "content": "\"Traditionally, scientists have attributed coral declines after mass bleaching events to the bleaching only,\" says Marilyn Brandt, a post-doctoral researcher at the University of Miami and the lead author on the paper. \"This study shows that the interplay between diseases and bleaching can play a much larger role than we realized.\"Corals rely on algae that live inside each coral polyp to provide nutrients and supplemental oxygen. Bleaching occurs when these colorful algae die out or leave the polyps, often in response to overly warm conditions. Without their brightly colored algae, the coral's skeleton becomes visible through its transparent tissue, making it appear white. Although the tissue remains intact and can recover over time, this stressful condition can cause corals to stop growing and reproducing.Warmer water temperatures can also lead to increased incidence of coral diseases, which, unlike most bleaching, can cause irreparable loss of coral tissues. In many cases, bleaching and disease occur concurrently on coral reefs. Brandt and her colleagues wondered if the occurrences of bleaching and disease were linked beyond simply occurring under the same conditions.\"Coral bleaching and coral diseases are both related to prolonged thermal stress,\" says Brandt. \"But we wanted to look closer to find out whether they were interacting and what was actually causing the decline we see.\"In the summer and fall of 2005, the same oceanic temperature shifts that contributed to the creation of Hurricane Katrina caused a warm mass of water to settle over the northeast Caribbean and parts of Florida. This sustained warming triggered a mass coral bleaching event that affected up to 90 percent of coral reef cover in the area. Brandt and her colleagues surveyed colonies in the Florida Keys before, during and after this event to determine the relationship between bleaching and coral disease.The researchers found that the coral diseases they observed were related to bleaching, but in different ways. The prevalence of white plague disease increased during the bleaching event, an observation that Brandt says may have to do with increased susceptibility to the disease.\"Higher temperatures can increase the growth rate of coral pathogens, such as bacteria and other microbes, so we probably see a higher disease incidence because of the expansion of these pathogens in the environment,\" Brandt says. \"But bleaching is also a stressed state, and just like any other animal under stress, the coral's disease resistance is lowered.\"In addition, the researchers found that colonies already infected with another disease, known as dark spot disease, suffered more extensive bleaching than healthy corals. Brandt thinks a fungus that's likely associated with this infection could cause the relationship of the algae and the coral to be weakened, leaving the corals more susceptible to bleaching.Because diseases happen on a much finer scale than mass bleaching events, Brandt says that more informed management of coral ecosystems should involve more frequent monitoring to determine the underlying causes of coral damage.\"Understanding how these different stressors interact can help explain the mortality pattern we see after large-scale bleaching events,\" says Brandt. \"If we understand what's causing the mortality, we can institute control measures that are more specific to the causes.\""}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_503", "content": "âOcean cyclones are areas of upwelling, meaning that cold water is not far from the surface as compared to the water surrounding it,â said Nan Walker, ESL director. âThe Gulf of Mexico is full of ocean cyclones, or cold water eddies, many of which move rapidly around the margin of Gulfâs Loop Current, which is the main source of water for the Gulf Stream.âWhile the upwelling is important to Gulf fisheries because it delivers nutrients into the surface waters, causing algal blooms and attracting marine life to the areas, oceanographers have recently begun to realize that these cyclones intensify currents near the surface and along the bottom of the ocean in areas of gas and oil exploration.âNow,â Walker added, âour research has shown that ocean cyclones also provide temperatures cold enough to reduce the intensity of large Gulf of Mexico hurricanes.âWalkerâs research team has been looking into the upwelling phenomena since 2004, when they were able to use satellite data received at the ESL to view ocean temperatures soon after Hurricane Ivanâs Gulf crossing.âClear skies gave us a rare opportunity to really analyze the oceanic conditions surrounding the wake of Ivan,â said Walker. âWe saw abnormally low temperatures in two large areas along the stormâs track, where minimum temperatures were well below those required to support a hurricane, about 80 degrees Fahrenheit.â This suggested to Walker that areas of extreme cooling could be providing immediate negative feedback to Gulf hurricanes, decreasing their intensity.âIn Ivanâs case, we found that its wind field increased the counter-clockwise spinning of the ocean cyclones in its path, catapulting cold water to the surface, which in turn reduced the oceanic âfuelâ needed for the hurricane to maintain its strength,â said Walker. She observed that Ivanâs intensity decreased as it moved toward the Mississippi/Alabama coast, despite the presence of a large warm eddy, a feature generally known for its potential to increase hurricane strength. Thus, the impact of the cold eddies overwhelmed that of the warm eddy.âCool wakes are most beneficial when the storm occurs later in the season because the Gulf doesnât warm as rapidly in fall and may not have time to warm back up,â said Walker.The research being conducted at ESL could eventually lead to novel new weather study techniques.âOur research, in collaboration with Robert Leben at the University of Colorado, is providing an advanced monitoring system so that likely ocean impacts can be assessed in advance of the Gulf crossing,â said Walker. âHowever, it is important to remember that we donât predict; we provide valuable information that serves as tools for those in the business of predicting, such as the National Hurricane Center.âOf course, this is only one facet of the work done at LSUâs ESL.

The eastern El NiÃ±o increases wind sheer in the Atlantic that may hamper the development of major hurricanes there. The central Pacific El NiÃ±o, near the International Dateline, has been blamed for worsening drought conditions in Australia and India as well as minimizing the effects of its beneficial brother to the east.Led by Sang-Wook Yeh of the Korea Ocean Research & Development Institute, a team of scientists applied Pacific Ocean sea surface temperature data from the past 150 years to 11 global warming models developed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Eight of the models showed that global warming conditions will increase the incidence of the central Pacific El NiÃ±o. Over the past 20 years, according to the data, the frequency of an El NiÃ±o event in the central Pacific has increased from one out of every five to half of all El NiÃ±o occurrences.\"The results described in this paper indicate that the global impacts of El NiÃ±o may significantly change as the climate warms,\" said Yeh.Though the centers of the central and eastern areas are roughly 4,100 miles apart, El NiÃ±os historically have not simultaneously occurred in both places. An increase in central Pacific El NiÃ±o events may reduce the hurricane-shielding effects of the eastern Pacific event.\"Currently, we are in the middle of a developing eastern Pacific El NiÃ±o event,\" said Kirtman, \"which is part of why we're experiencing such a mild hurricane season in the Atlantic. We also anticipate the southern United States to have a fairly wet winter, and the northeast may be dry and warm.\"Kirtman expects the current El NiÃ±o event to end next spring, perhaps followed by a La NiÃ±a, which he expects may bode for a more intense Atlantic hurricane season in 2010.Growing up in southern California, Kirtman frequently had to man the sump pump in his family's basement during the rainy season, which he learned later was caused by El NiÃ±o.\"We're finally learning about how ocean current flows and increases in sea surface temperature influence weather patterns, which affect every one of us, including the kid manning the sump pump,\" he said. \"I have devoted much of my career to studying El NiÃ±o because of how it affects people and their lives.\"Kirtman works with various meteorological organizations around the world to help developing countries respond to climate extremes.\"We provide them with the forecasts,\" he said, \"and the countries use the results to develop their response.\""}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_505", "content": "The findings can be found in âAs the size of landfalling hurricanes from the Gulf of Mexico increases, weâre seeing more tornadoes than we did in the past that can occur up to two days and several hundred miles inland from the landfall location,â said James Belanger, doctoral student in the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at Georgia Tech and lead author of the paper.Currently, itâs well known that when hurricanes hit land, thereâs a risk that tornadoes may form in the area. Until now, no one has quantified that risk because observations of tornadoes were too sporadic prior to the installation of the NEXRAD Doppler Radar Network in 1995. Belanger along with co-authors Judith Curry, professor and chair of the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at Tech and research scientist Carlos Hoyos, decided to see if they could create a model using the more reliable tornado record thatâs existed since 1995.The model that they developed for hurricane-induced tornadoes uses four factors that serve as good predictors of tornado activity: size, intensity, track direction and whether thereâs a strong gradient of moisture at midlevels in the storm's environment.âThe size of a tropical cyclone basically sets the domain over which tornadoes can form. So a larger storm that has more exposure over land has a higher propensity for producing tornadoes than a smaller one, on average,â said Belanger.The team looked at 127 tropical cyclones from 1948 up to the 2008 hurricane season and went further back to 1920 modifying their model to account for the type of data collected at that time. They found that since 1995 there has been a 35 percent percent increase in the size of tropical cyclones from the Gulf compared to the previous active period of storms from 1948-1964, which has lead to a doubling in the number of tornadoes produced per storm. The number of hurricane-induced tornadoes during the 2004 and 2005 hurricane seasons is unprecedented in the historical record since 1920, according to the model.âThe beauty of the model is that not only can we use it to reconstruct the observational record, but we can also use it as a forecasting tool,â said Belanger.To test how well it predicted the number of tornadoes associated with a given hurricane, they input the intensity of the storm at landfall, itâs size, track and moisture at mid-levels, and were able to generate a forecast of how many tornadoes formed from the hurricane. They found that for Hurricane Ike in 2008, their model predicted exactly the number of tornadoes that occurred, 33. For Hurricane Katrina in 2005, the model predicted 56 tornadoes, and 58 were observed.The teamâs next steps are to take a look to see how hurricane size, not just intensity (as indicated by the Safir-Simpson scale), affects the damage experienced by residents.âStorm surge, rain and flooding are all connected to the size of the storm,â said Curry. âYet, size is an underappreciated factor associated with damage from hurricanes. So its important to develop a better understanding of what controls hurricane size and how size influences hurricane damage. The great damage in Galveston from Hurricane Ike in 2008 was inconsistent with Category 2 wind speeds at landfall, but it was the large size that caused the big storm surge that did most of the damage.â"}

If the ground is wet, the storm is likely to sustain, while dry conditions should calm the storm.\"Once a storm comes overland, it was unclear whether it would stall, accelerate or fizzle out,\" said Dev Niyogi, Indiana state climatologist and associate professor of agronomy and earth and atmospheric sciences. \"We found that whether a storm becomes more intense or causes heavy rains could depend on the land conditions - something we'd not considered. Thus far we've looked at these storms based mainly on ocean conditions or upper atmosphere.\"Niyogi said tropical storms gain their strength from warm ocean water evaporation.\"The same phenomenon - the evaporation from the ocean that sustains the storms - could be the same phenomenon that sustains that storm over land with moisture in the soil,\" he said. \"The storm will have more moisture and energy available over wet soil than dry.\"Niyogi's team's findings were published in the August edition of the journal Storm data fed into a model showed that higher levels of ground moisture would sustain Indian monsoon depressions. The model's prediction was proven when compared to ground conditions for 125 Indian monsoons over 33 years, where storms sustained when the ground was wet at landfall.Knowing the sustainability of a storm could lead to better predictions on flooding and damage inland before a monsoon or a hurricane makes landfall.\"We think the physics is such that we could see similar results more broadly, such as in the United States,\" Niyogi said.The National Science Foundation and NASA funded the research. The Purdue led-team also consisted of researchers from the National Center for Atmospheric Research, NASA-GSFC/ESSIC, the University of Georgia, the Indian Space Research Organization and the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi.Niyogi said the next step is to use the model and ground moisture data to test these theories for hurricanes in the United States."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_507", "content": "\"Hurricanes, typhoons and cyclones are both a curse and a blessing for highly populated tropical and subtropical nations, bringing both terrible destruction and life-sustaining rainfall each year,\" said Bill Patzert, climatologist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. \"Many scientists have hypothesized that in the future our warming climate will change hurricane-induced rainfall patterns, perhaps increasing the destructive power of these storms. NASA, NOAA and university scientists are mining the wealth of scientific information from A-Train instruments to improve our understanding of current and future hurricanes. These data will help officials plan for better coastal protection and the most effective public policy.\"The A-Train satellite formation currently consists of five satellites flying in close proximity: Aqua, CloudSat, CALIPSO, PARASOL and Aura.Each satellite in the A-Train crosses the equator within a few minutes of each another at around 1:30 p.m. local time. By combining the different sets of nearly simultaneous observations, scientists are able to gain a better understanding of important parameters related to climate change. The two primary satellites in the A-Train that contribute to hurricane research are Aqua and CloudSat. The other satellites provide important information about clouds and aerosols that assist with hurricane research.So why put all of these different satellites in a \"train\"? By combining the satellites and their data, scientists are able to gain a better understanding of important parameters related to the behavior of hurricanes, in addition to climate change information. The A-Train formation allows for simultaneous coordinated measurements. Data from several different satellites can be used together to obtain comprehensive information about atmospheric components or processes that are happening at the same time. Combining the information collected simultaneously from several sources gives a more complete answer to many questions than would be possible from any one satellite taken alone at different times.Aqua is designed to acquire precise atmospheric and oceanic measurements to provide a greater understanding of their role in Earth's climate and its variations. There are three instruments that fly on Aqua that are used in tropical cyclone research.Aquaâs Moderate Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument views the entire surface of Earth every one to two days, providing visible imagery from ice caps to hurricanes.The Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-EOS (AMSR-E) on Aqua was provided by Japanâs Aerospace agency (JAXA). Over the ocean, AMSR-E microwave frequencies probe through smaller cloud particles to measure the microwave emissions from larger raindrops. AMSR-E provides improved measurements of rainfall rates, which is very useful to know as tropical storms approach land or are traveling over land.Aquaâs Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) suite provides visible, infrared and microwave images of tropical storms. AIRS also measures cloud top temperature and pressure and the vertical profile of water vapor. Cloud top temperatures help forecasters recognize deep convective cells. Clouds at different heights are shown in different colors in the infrared satellite images, so that the highest clouds appear purple, and the second highest clouds appear in blue. How does infrared imagery detect how high clouds are in the sky? The coldest ones are higher in the sky (because in the troposphere, the lowest layer of atmosphere where weather happens, temperatures fall the higher up you go until you get to the stratosphere).In NASAâs infrared imagery, purple clouds are as cold as or colder than 220 Kelvin or minus 63 degrees Fahrenheit (F). The blue colored clouds are about 240 Kelvin, or minus 27F. The colder the clouds are, the higher they are, and the more powerful the thunderstorms are that make up the cyclone.Because the infrared imagery provides temperature it also indicates how warm the ocean waters are that surround a storm. Warmer temperatures are also false-colored so that an orange color represents temperatures of 80F (300 Kelvin).CloudsatCloudSat uses advanced radar to \"slice\" through clouds to see a unique view of what a tropical cyclone looks like from the side. CloudSat sees structure, composition, and effects of clouds. CloudSat imagery is also false-colored to indicate intensity of the reflected radar energy. CloudSat data also show how high thunderstorms are in tropical cyclones, which is important in intensity forecasting. Higher thunderstorms or \"hot towers\" indicate a stronger storm. In CloudSat images there are certain things to look for: Blue areas along the top of the clouds indicate cloud ice, while wavy blue lines on the bottom center of the image indicate intense rainfall.CALIPSOCALIPSO provides new insight into the role that clouds and atmospheric aerosols (airborne particles) play in regulating Earth's weather, climate, and air quality. CALIPSO and Aqua take coincident observations of the change in radiation (energy and heat) in a layer of the atmosphere. CALIPSO and CloudSat are highly complementary and together provide new, never-before-seen 3-D perspectives of how clouds and aerosols form, evolve, and affect weather and climate.PARASOLThe French satellite PARASOL (Polarization and Anisotropy of RÃ©flectances for Atmospheric Sciences coupled with Observations from a Lidar) works with CALIPSO to improve the characterization of cloud and aerosol microphysical and radiative properties, needed to understand and model the radiative impact of clouds and aerosols. Like CALIPSO, its data are not used directly in hurricane research. PARASOL provides polarized light measurements that allow better characterization of clouds and aerosols in Earth's atmosphere, in particular, distinguishing natural and human-produced aerosols.AuraAura, Latin for air, is dedicated to the study of the chemistry andy dynamics of the atmosphere. Aura is designed to produce the first global assessment of tropospheric ozone and observe the protective stratospheric ozone layer. Aura measurements are needed to help solve the mystery of increasing stratospheric water vapor. Relative to tropical cyclones and thunderstorms (convective storms) Aura data are being used to try and answer fundamental climate change questions related to moistening or drying of the upper troposphere as convective activity changes.More NASA Satellites Involved in Hurricane StudiesNASA uses several other satellites in hurricane research that are not in the A-Train, including the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite, Jason-1, OSTM/Jason-2, Landsat-5, Landsat-7, QuikScat, and Terra. NASA also creates images from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES). NASA researches hurricanes and supplies some of the data from these satellites to NOAA, who forecast the storms.Using all of these satellites and their instruments, NASA scientists gather data on many factors that determine if a tropical cyclone may strengthen or weaken. Data include: storm and surface winds; sea surface heights and temperatures; rainfall intensity and area; lightning; cloud water; water vapor; cloud heights, extent of cloud cover and cloud temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure; cloud development; and size of the storm.The satellites that work solo include TRMM and QuikScat. TRMM and QuikScat each provide important data that is used operationally by the National Hurricane Center to assist in their forecasts. TRMM's rainfall estimates within a storm, and imaging of towering clouds known as \"hot towers,\" give hints about a storm's strength and whether it is weakening or strengthening. QuikScat uses microwaves to peer through clouds and obtain wind speeds in tropical cyclones, a critical observation in knowing if a storm is changing strength. Terra and Landsat-7 are members of the Morning Constellation. In the Terra satellite, there is a MODIS instrument like that on Aqua, and there is the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) instrument that provides global information on cloud heights and cloud motion winds. Landsat provides before and after images of a hurricane's impact onshore. Emergency managers in Louisiana used Landsat imagery after Hurricane Katrina to see areas affected by flooding.There are also a fleet of GOES satellites in orbit that watch weather in the eastern and western halves of the United States. Currently, GOES-11 watches the U.S. West Coast, and GOES-12 watches the East Coast. The Jason-1 and OSTM/Jason-2 are in interleaved orbits and work with each other to provide complementary data.A variety of organizations manage the satellites inside and outside of the A-Train: PARASOL is managed by the French Space Agency (CNES). CALIPSO is a joint NASA Langley Research Center/CNES project. Aqua, Aura, Terra, and TRMM are managed by NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Md. CloudSat, QuikScat, and Jason-1 are managed by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), Pasadena, Calif. Landsat is a joint U.S. Geological Survey/NASA managed mission. GOES is managed by the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration; NASA Goddard's GOES Project Office generates GOES images and animations. The international OSTM/Jason-2 is managed by a 4-way partnership of CNES, NOAA, NASA/JPL and European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT).The next time a hurricane is brewing anywhere around the world, you can be sure that NASA researchers are going to catch the A-Train."}

Felicia dissipated before it reached Hawaii, and the remnants of Maka are 1,400 miles west-southwest of Kauai. Maka's remnant clouds and showers are still moving west, and it's unlikely that it will re-organize. That means a quiet Central Pacific Ocean for the next two days.In the Eastern Pacific, Tropical Depression 9E (TD9E) appears to be fizzling although it may get a second chance at life, while Tropical Depression 10E powered up into Tropical Storm Guillermo.The remnants of TD9E are weakly spinning to around 30 mph, while it continues moving west-southwest near 9 mph. The center was located about 1,750 miles west-southwest of the southern tip of Baja California, near 13.9 north and 134.1 west. The National Hurricane Center noted that shower and thunderstorm activity has increased this morning, and the environment seems to be a little more conducive to strengthening, so TD9E isn't written off yet. In fact, there's about a 30-50% chance it may strengthen back into a tropical depression.Meanwhile, Tropical Depression 10E gained strength took the name Guillermo and it's sustained winds whipped up to near 50 mph. Guillermo is moving west-northwest near 16 mph and will continue in that direction. Guillermo is closer to mainland Mexico, but poses no threat as its heading away from land.

{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_509", "content": "\"La NiÃ±a conditions are favorable for hurricanes because they lead to less wind shear in the tropical Atlantic,\" said Michael E. Mann, professor of meteorology, Penn State. When combined with warm tropical Atlantic ocean temperatures, a requirement for hurricanes to form, conditions become ideal for high levels of activity.\"During an El NiÃ±o, the more familiar half of the El NiÃ±o Southern Oscillation (ENSO), there is more wind shear in the Caribbean and fewer hurricanes. The low Atlantic hurricane activity so far during this current season is likely related to the mitigating effects of an emerging El NiÃ±o event.\"Hurricane activity since the mid-1990s is the highest in the historical record, but that only goes back a little more than a century and is most accurate since the advent of air travel and satellites in recent decades,\" said Mann. \"It is therefore difficult to assess if the recent increase in hurricane activity is in fact unusual.\"Mann, working with Jonathan D. Woodruff, assistant professor of geosciences, University of Massachusetts; Jeffrey P. Donnelly, associate scientist, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, and Zhihua Zhang, postdoctoral assistant, Penn State, reconstructed the past 1,500 years of hurricanes using two independent methods. They report their results in the Aug. 13 issue of One estimate of hurricane numbers is based on sediment deposited during landfall hurricanes. The researchers looked for coastal areas where water breached the normal boundaries of the beaches and overwashed into protected basins. Samples from Puerto Rico, the U.S. Gulf coast, the Southern U.S. coast, the mid-Atlantic coast and the southeastern New England coast were radiocarbon dated and combined to form a history of landfall hurricanes.The other method used a previously developed statistical model for predicting hurricane activity based on climate variables. They applied the model to paleoclimate reconstructions of tropical Atlantic sea surface temperature, the history of ENSO and another climate pattern called the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), which is related to the year-to-year fluctuations of the jet stream. Warm waters are necessary for hurricane development, ENSO influences the wind shear and the NAO controls the path of storms, determining whether or not they encounter favorable conditions for development.The researchers compared the results of both hurricane estimates, taking into account that the sediment measurements only record landfall hurricanes, but that the relationship between landfall hurricanes and storms that form and dissipate without ever hitting land can be estimated.Both hurricane reconstructions indicate similar overall patterns and both indicate a high period of hurricane activity during the Medieval Climate Anomaly around AD 900 to 1100.\"We are at levels now that are about as high as anything we have seen in the past 1,000 years,\" said Mann.The two estimates of hurricane numbers do not match identically. The researchers note that they do not know the exact force of a storm that will breach the beach area and deposit sediments. They are also aware that the relationship between landfalling hurricanes and those that remain at sea is not uniform through all time periods. However, they believe that key features like the medieval peak and subsequent lull are real and help to validate our current understanding of the factors governing long-term changes in Atlantic hurricane activity.One thing the estimates show is that long periods of warm Atlantic ocean conditions produce greater Atlantic hurricane activity.\"It seems that the paleodata support the contention that greenhouse warming may increase the frequency of Atlantic tropical storms,\" said Mann. \"It may not be just that the storms are stronger, but that there are there may be more of them as well.\"The National Science Foundation and the Bermuda Institute for Ocean Sciences supported this work."}

She's far out to sea, about 1,480 miles west-southwest of the southern tip of Baja California near 15.5 north and 131.2 west. She's moving west-northwest near 10 mph, and is expected to speed up and start to weaken in the next couple of days because of colder waters in her path. Felicia's minimum central pressure is 937 millibars.Boys can be stubborn, and Enrique is proving that, even though he's a tropical storm with a boy's name. Despite Enrique's close proximity to Felicia, he's maintaining sustained winds near 50 mph. At 5 a.m. EDT, Enrique's center was 345 miles behind Felicia's, near 20.7 north and 125.9 west. He's speeding northwest near 17 mph into cooler waters which is going to weaken him over the next day or two. Enrique's minimum central pressure is 1,000 millibars, much higher than Felicia's indicating a much weaker storm. The higher the atmospheric pressure the weaker the tropical cyclone.NASA's Terra satellite flew over Felicia and Enrique and using the Moderate Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument captured them side-by-side on August 5 at 3 p.m. EDT. The satellite image clearly showed an eye in powerful Hurricane Felicia, while Tropical Storm Enrique's eye was not clear.Terra wasn't the only satellite to capture Felicia and Enrique battling it out for territory in the Eastern Pacific Ocean. NASA's Aqua satellite also flew overhead and its Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) instrument captured the frigid cloud temperatures in both storms. Felicia's clouds are colder and higher than Enrique's clouds, because stronger hurricanes have higher (and more powerful) thunderstorms.Using AIRS and other infrared imagery to determine cloud temperature, the National Hurricane Center noted in their discussion on August 6, that Felicia's \"eye has been warming and has become more well-defined over the past few hours but at the same time the cold cloud tops around the eye have also been warming.\" That's an indication that Felicia will start waning in strength."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_511", "content": "Thatâs one of the findings from a new scientific study of the fate of corals in the wake of large climate-driven bleaching and storm events.âWe have found clear evidence that coral recruitment â the regrowth of young corals â drops sharply in the wake of a major bleaching event or a hurricane,â says lead author Dr Jennie Mallela of the ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies and Australian National University.Using the island of Tobago in the Caribbean as their laboratory she and colleague Professor Â James Crabbe of the University of Bedfordshire, UK, backtracked to 1980 to see what had happened to the corals in the wake of nine hurricanes, tropical storms and bleaching events.âIn every case there was a sharp drop in coral recruitment following the event â often by as much as two thirds to three quarters. Not only were fewer new coral colonies formed, but also far fewer of the major reef building coral species recruited successfully.ââThis finding mirrors our modelling studies on the fringing reefs of Jamaica, and on the Meso-American Barrier reef off the coast of Belizeâ, says Prof. Crabbe.Tobago lies outside the main Caribbean hurricane belt and therefore is more typical of the circumstances of most coral reefs around the world.Â  Nevertheless its corals are disrupted by a major storm or bleaching every three or four years â and the frequency of this may be growing.âClimate researchers are seeing increasing evidence for a direct relationship between global warming and rising hurricane intensity as well as frequency,â Jennie explains. âGlobal warming produces significant increases in the frequency of high sea surface temperatures (SSTs), and hurricane winds are strengthened by warm surface waters.âThe high temperatures cause bleaching, while the storms inflict physical destruction on the corals as well as eroding the rocky platforms they need to grow on, or burying them in sand.âMaintaining coral reef populations in the face of large-scale degradation depends critically on recruitment â the ability of the corals to breed successfully and settle on the reef to form new colonies. Our research suggests this process is severely disrupted after one of these major events.âIf the disruption is sufficiently large it may threaten the actual survival of some of the larger and more spectacular reef building and brain corals, she says. âIn the aftermath of a big storm or bleaching event, some of these important species appear not to have recruited at all.âHealthy reefs usually have high numbers of coral recruits and juvenile corals, whereas degraded systems typically have far fewer young colonies.âThe concern is that if major storms and bleaching become more frequent as the climate warms, the ability of individual reefs to renew themselves may break down completely, Jennie says.âWhile our work was carried out in the Caribbean, it has general implications for coral reefs globally, and deepens our concern as to what may happen to them as global warming advances and the worldâs climate becomes more tempestuous.âThe research paper is Mallela, J., Crabbe, M.J.C., Hurricanes and coral bleaching linked to changes in coral recruitment in Tobago, and is published in the latest issue of Marine Environmental Research (2009)."}

Weakening winds and rising air pressure are signs of a weakening storm. Lana was located near 14.5 degrees north latitude and 162.0 west longitude and headed west near 13 knots (15 mph).When NASA's CloudSat satellite's Cloud Profiling Radar captured a sideways look across Lana the day before, Sunday, August 2, it was still a tropical storm with high clouds higher than 14 kilometers (8.7 miles) high. CloudSat measured the highest, coldest cloud temperatures near minus 60 degrees Celsius (minus 76 degrees Fahrenheit)! Those high clouds indicated that there were some strong thunderstorms still occurring on Sunday, August 2. At the time when CloudSat swept over Lana, its maximum sustained winds were near 45 knots (52 mph) and pressure was 1008 millibars.Less than 24 hours later, satellite data showed that Lana lacked \"deep convection\" â that is, rapid rising air that helps to build the powerful thunderstorms that fuel the tropical storm. Thus, Lana was re-classified as a weaker tropical depression. Forecasters believe that by August 4, Lana will start dissipating, and by August 5, she'll be a remnant low pressure area in the Central Pacific."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_513", "content": "With this year's storm season under way, the UH engineering team's project is entering a new phase as participants collect and analyze fresh samples from Galveston Bay and related waterways.Cullen College of Engineering professor Hanadi Rifai, who has studied pollution in Houston-area bodies of water in partnership with both state and federal authorities since 2001, is leading the team.\"Our work with the Galveston Bay system started in the early '90s with funding from the EPA Galveston Bay National Estuary Program,\" said Rifai, whose team helped write the first \"State of the Bay\" report identifying the environmental challenges facing the estuary.\"We have since focused on POPs, or persistent organic pollutants, which include dioxins and polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs. We have a unique opportunity this year to study the effect of Hurricane Ike on these pollutants, particularly in the water and sediment of the estuary, so we are gathering a one-of-its-kind data set for the 'after' condition that we can compare to our pre-Ike 2008 data set,\" Rifai said. \"The results will be enlightening from an environmental impact perspective of hurricanes on natural resources such as Galveston Bay.\"As part of the Environmental Protection Agency's Total Maximum Daily Load Program, the team has been creating sophisticated models to help determine how much pollution a body of water is taking in and where that pollution is coming from. The team has upwards of 50 monitoring sites, Rifai said, and it looks for pollutants in sediment, water and tissue.\"The EPA has asked the states to come up with water bodies that do not meet Clean Water Act standards and with ways to address the problem,\" Rifai said. \"For the first few years, we looked at dioxins, and now we're also looking at PCBs in every body of water in the Houston metro area, all the way to upper Galveston Bay. We're focused on past and current industrial pollutants.\"Dioxins are primarily byproducts resulting from paper mills, industrial waste incineration and water purification processes, but they also result from natural sources like forest fires in much smaller quantities. Rifai said her team believes the majority of dioxins found locally today are from historical sources.Meanwhile, PCBs, whose manufacture was banned in 1979, long were used as coolants and lubricants in electrical transformers and capacitors. Why they persist today in local waterways and seafood remains something of a mystery, Rifai said.\"Now, what we find with the PCBs, and what's got people worried, is, if indeed it's historical from before the ban, you would see it in the sediment,\" she explained. \"But, we're actually seeing the patterns have shifted, as if there are some new sources of PCBs. Since the 1990s, we've had so much growth and industrial activity kicking back up that there might be some new material coming in.\"What those new sources are remains unclear, Rifai said, and materials that were manufactured with PCBs before the ban may still be in use.\"Historically with PCBs, if you've made a million transformers, you didn't have to destroy them. You use them up till they die,\" she said, adding that many outdated transformers were ruined by Hurricane Ike.In July 2008, the Texas Department of State Health Services issued an advisory for Galveston Bay, Chocolate Bay, East Bay, West Bay, Trinity Bay and contiguous waters, saying consumers should limit intake of spotted seatrout, also known as speckled trout, and gafttop catfish to no more than one 8-ounce meal a month. Furthermore, children, women who are nursing, pregnant or who may become pregnant are to have none. Long-term consumption of both dioxins and PCBs is believed to cause numerous health effects, including cancer.\"The problem is that these compounds are what is called 'bioaccumulative.'  Once they get in the food chain, they accumulate â you cannot synthesize them,\" Rifai said. \"A lot of the impacts of those compounds are subtle.  They might be neurologic; they might be developmental. They're the kinds of things that do not show up for quite a while.\"The inclusion of new species in the advisories, Rifai said, has many implications, because commercial and recreational fishing is a $100-plus million industry annually. But, when her team was asked by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality to do its own assessment of the state health department findings last year, the results were what Rifai expected.\"We told them that we thought the data was valid. We actually merged it with our data, and it was very consistent with what we see,\" she said. \"We looked carefully at what was done, and, at the end of the day, I wasn't surprised.\"While the industrial history of Houston is amazing, Rifai said, residents and officials are dealing with the repercussions of it now and will continue to for a long time, especially in coastal communities.\"You have to balance the protection of the resource with the need for development and growth,\" she said. \"You also have to think about areas really vulnerable to these extreme events, like hurricanes.\"She notes, however, that industrial partners have been critically important to her team's work.\"I'll tell you, industry in this area has come a long way. They really realize that they live in a community, ought to give back to the community and ought to work with the community. What's good for the water is going to be good for everyone around the water.\""}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_514", "content": "After about five years developing and assessing the model, Associate Scholar Scientist Tim LaRow and his COAPS colleagues are putting the system to the test this year with their first-ever hurricane forecast. The COAPS model is one of only a handful of soâcalled \"dynamical models\" in the world being used to study seasonal hurricane activity.The COAPS model has predicted a below-average season in the Atlantic Ocean, with a mean of eight named storms and four hurricanes based partially on emerging El Nino conditions. During an El Nino, the warmer ocean temperatures in the tropical eastern Pacific tend to suppress hurricane activity in the Atlantic. The historical seasonal average is 11 tropical storms and six hurricanes.\"Making a real-time forecast for the first time is always very interesting and a very good test of the model,\" LaRow said. \"The hard part is in the waiting to see how the model verifies.\"LaRow and COAPS researchers Lydia Stefanova and Dong-Wook Shin issued their forecast on June 1, the official start of the six-month hurricane season. The tropics traditionally don't become active until the early fall months, so it's too early to tell if the forecast is on track. However, the researchers have good reason to feel confident.Before making this year's prediction, they used the model to perform 20 years of re-forecasts, or hindcasts, using the sea surface temperatures determined by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration on June 1 of every year from 1986 to 2005. They found a very high correlation between the model's predictions of the number and intensity of tropical cyclones and what actually occurred during those years.In addition, the model outperformed many statistical and other dynamical models, LaRow said. Statistical models use statistical relationships between oceanic and atmospheric variables to make a forecast, while dynamical models, such as the COAPS model, require major computing resources in order to make trillions of calculations using the equations of motion along with the best physical understanding of the atmosphere.The COAPS model uses the university's high-performance computer to synthesize massive amounts of information including atmospheric, ocean and land data. A key component of the COAPS model is NOAA's forecast of sea surface temperatures. But COAPS researchers continue to study their own model in an effort to better understand the relationship between sea surface temperatures and climate predictability.\"All models are unique, and what makes them unique is the physics inside them,\" LaRow said. \"How and why our model's collection of physical processes captures the year-to-year variability so well needs to be better understood. This research will lead to even greater seasonal forecasting skill in the future.\"In 2006, COAPS received a $6.2 million, five-year grant from NOAA that has been used, in part, to support the development of this model."}

Their model, which analyzes cell phone signals, adds a critical component to weather forecasting never before available.\"By monitoring the specific and fluctuating atmospheric moisture around cell phone towers throughout America, we can cheaply, effectively and reliably provide a more accurate 'critical moisture distribution' level for fine-tuning model predictions of big floods,\" says Prof. Pinhas Alpert, a geophysicist and head of Tel Aviv University's Porter School for Environmental Education.Prof. Alpert and his co-researchers Prof. Hagit Messer Yaron and doctoral fellow Noam David reported on their research in the April 2009 Cell phone towers emit radio waves that are diminished by moisture in the air, a factor that can be used to improve model warnings on flood levels. In addition, the researchers measured the rainfall distributions and were able to accurately estimate the size of impending floods before they struck. This was demonstrated in post-analysis of two case-studies of floods in the Judean Desert in Israel, where cell phone towers â and flash floods â are abundant.Using real data measurements collected from the towers, the researchers demonstrated how microwave links in a cellular network correlated with surface station humidity measurements. The data provided by cell phone towers is the missing link weather forecasters need to improve the accuracy of flood forecasting. The microwave data used in this study was supplied by two cellular providers Cellcom and Pelephone in Israel.\"Our method provides reliable measurement of moisture fields near the flood zone for the first time,\" notes Prof. Alpert, who also works with NASA on developing models to study global warming weather patterns. This new tool, he says, can add to the bigger picture of understanding climate change patterns in general.\"Accurate predictions of flooding were difficult before because there haven't been enough reliable measurements of moisture fields in remote locations,\" Prof. Alpert adds. Using the signals collected from cell phone towers as they communicate with base stations and our handsets, weather forecasters will now have a crucial missing piece of information for flood prediction that they never had before. It will permit forecasters and residents alike to more accurately gauge the danger they face from an impending flood.Because hundreds of thousands of cell phone towers are already in place, the Tel Aviv University invention can be adopted quickly. And cell phone companies are already collecting the data anyway, as Americans continue to ramp up their minutes of call time every month."}

Warming in the Central Pacific is associated with a higher storm frequency and a greater potential for making landfall along the Gulf coast and the coast of Central America.Even though the oceanic circulation pattern of warm water known as El NiÃ±o forms in the Pacific, it affects the circulation patterns across the globe, changing the number of hurricanes in the Atlantic. This regular type of El NiÃ±o (from the Spanish meaning \"little boy\" or \"Christ child\") is more difficult to forecast, with predictions of the December circulation pattern not coming until May. At first glance, that may seem like plenty of time. However, the summer before El NiÃ±o occurs, the storm patterns change, meaning that predictions of El NiÃ±o come only one month before the start of hurricane season in June. But El NiÃ±o Modoki follows a different prediction pattern.\"This new type of El NiÃ±o is more predictable,\" said Webster. \"We're not sure why, but this could mean that we get greater warning of hurricanes, probably by a number of months.\"As to why the form of El NiÃ±o is changing to El NiÃ±o Modoki, that's not entirely clear yet, said Webster.\"This could be part of a natural oscillation of El NiÃ±o,\" he said. \"Or it could be El NiÃ±o's response to a warming atmosphere. There are hints that the trade winds of the Pacific have become weaker with time and this may lead to the warming occurring further to the west. We need more data before we know for sure.\"In the study, Webster, along with Earth and Atmospheric Sciences Chair Judy Curry and research scientist Hye-Mi Kim used satellite data along with historical tropical storm records and climate models.The research team is currently looking at La NiÃ±a, the cooling of the surface waters in the Eastern and Central Pacific.\"In the past, La Nina has been associated with a greater than average number of North Atlantic hurricanes and La Nina seems to be changing its structure as well,\" said Webster. \"We're vitally interested in understanding why El NiÃ±o-La NiÃ±a has changed. To determine this we need to run a series of numerical experiments with climate models.\""}

But few people asked the residents themselves until recently. Stanford University psychologist Nicole Stephens and her colleagues decided to compare the views of outside observers with the perspectives of the New Orleans residents who actually rode out Katrina.The researchers conducted two surveys, one of observers and one of survivors. Observers were asked how they perceived survivors who left and those who did not, and survivors were asked to describe their own hurricane-related experiences. The study of observersâincluding a large group of relief workers, firefighters, and physiciansâperceived those who evacuated their homes as more self-reliant and hardworking. Those who stayed, however, were described as careless, passive, depressed and hopeless even though the observers were well aware that these residents lacked the resources to leave (money, transportation, out-of-town relatives).When the psychologists surveyed actual Katrina survivors, they found that those who stayed behind did not feel powerless or passive. On the contrary, they saw themselves as connected with their neighbors, more communitarian than independent from others. Their stories emphasized their faith in God and their feelings of caring for others.The psychologists also took detailed measures of all the survivors' well-beingâtheir mood, life satisfaction, mental health, drug and alcohol use.

{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_519", "content": "But tropical cyclones aren't the only storms that generate hurricane-force winds. Among others that do is a type of storm that dominates the weather in parts of the United States and other non-tropical regions every fall, winter and into spring: extratropical cyclones.Scientists have long known that extratropical cyclones (also known as mid-latitude or baroclinic storms) sometimes produce hurricane-force winds. But before QuikScat, hurricane-force extratropical cyclones were thought to be relatively rare. Thanks to QuikScat, we now know that such storms occur much more frequently than previously believed, and the satellite has given forecasters an effective tool for routinely and consistently detecting and forecasting them.These storms, which occur near busy trans-oceanic shipping lanes, pose a significant threat to life and property for those on the high seas, generating high winds and waves up to 30 meters (100 feet) high. When they make landfall, in areas like Alaska, the Pacific Northwest, New England and the U.S. mid-Atlantic coast, they produce strong winds, high surf, coastal flooding, heavy rains, river flooding and even blizzard conditions.Take the \"Hanukkah Eve\" extratropical cyclone of Dec. 14-15, 2006, for example. That storm viciously raked the U.S. Pacific Northwest and British Columbia with torrential rainfall and hurricane-force winds exceeding 87 knots (100 miles per hour) in spots. Dozens of people were injured and 18 people lost their lives, while thousands of trees were downed, power was knocked out for more than 1.5 million residents and structural damage topped $350 million.NOAA defines an extratropical cyclone as \"a storm system that primarily gets its energy from the horizontal temperature contrasts that exist in the atmosphere.\" These low pressure systems have associated cold fronts, warm fronts and occluded fronts. Tropical cyclones, in contrast, don't usually vary much in temperature at Earth's surface, and their winds are generated by the energy released as clouds and rain form in warm, moist, tropical air. While a tropical cyclone's strongest winds are near Earth's surface, the strongest winds in extratropical cyclones are about 12 kilometers (8 miles) up, in the tropopause. Tropical cyclones can become extratropical, and vice versa.Extratropical cyclones occur in both the North Atlantic and North Pacific year-round. Those with hurricane-force winds have been observed from September through May. Their frequency typically begins to increase in October, peaks in December and January, and tapers off sharply after March. They can range from less than 100 kilometers (62 miles) in diameter to more than 4,000 kilometers (nearly 2,500 miles) across. They typically last about five days, but their hurricane-force winds are usually short-lived--just 24 hours or less. Because they can intensify rapidly, they're often referred to as meteorological \"bombs.\" Wind speeds in extratropical cyclones can vary from just 10 or 20 knots (12 to 23 miles per hour) to hurricane-force (greater than 63 knots, or 74 miles per hour). During their development, they can trek along at more than 30 knots (35 miles per hour), but they slow down as they mature. At their seasonal peak, up to eight such storms of varying intensity have been observed at once in both the North Atlantic and North Pacific.Early work by scientists at NASA, NOAA and other organizations demonstrated the effectiveness of using scatterometers for detecting these powerful and destructive winds. Scatterometers work by sending radar signals to the ocean surface and measuring the strength of the radar signals that bounce back. The higher the wind speed, the more the ocean surface is disturbed, and the stronger the reflection that is bounced back to the satellite.Among those who pioneered these efforts at NASA was Senior Research Scientist Timothy Liu of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif., who used data from the NASA Scatterometer, the predecessor to QuikScat, to study the transition of tropical cyclones into extratropical storms in 1997. In addition, Robert Atlas of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Md., demonstrated that scatterometer data were able to improve predictions of extratropical storm strength and location.Joe Sienkiewicz, chief of the Ocean Applications Branch at NOAA's Ocean Prediction Center, Camp Springs, Md., says QuikScat data have raised the awareness of forecasters to the occurrence of hurricane-force intensity conditions in extratropical cyclones and have significantly advanced their short-term wind warning and forecast processes.\"QuikScat winds have given forecasters at NOAA's Ocean Prediction Center a high level of situational awareness over the data-sparse waters of the North Atlantic and North Pacific Oceans,\" he said. \"Ocean Prediction Center forecasters daily examine every QuikScat pass and patch of wind and frequently base wind warning and forecast decisions solely on QuikScat winds. Through confidence gained from QuikScat, the National Weather Service began issuing warnings for dangerous hurricane-force winds in extratropical cyclones in December 2000.\"From 10 years of QuikScat, we have learned that hurricane force winds in extratropical cyclones occur more frequently than thought, are most frequent in winter months, and the conditions are most often observed south of the cyclone center,\" he added.Over the years, the number of storms observed with hurricane-force winds has steadily increased due to forecasters gaining confidence using the data, and improvements to the QuikScat data. From the fall of 2006 through 2008, NOAA's Ocean Prediction Center identified and issued warnings for 115 separate extratropical cyclones (64 in the Atlantic and 51 in the Pacific) that reached hurricane force.As confirmed in a 2008 study, QuikScat substantially extends the ability of forecasters to detect hurricane-force wind events in extratropical storms. For the studied case, QuikScat was able to identify more than three-and-a-half times as many hurricane-force events as combined data from the European ASCAT sensor on the METOP-A satellite, directly-measured buoy and ship information, and model predictions.Another study in 2002 found that incorporating QuikScat data increased the number of wind warnings the Ocean Prediction Center issued for extratropical cyclones by 30 percent in the North Atlantic and by 22 percent in the North Pacific. Between 2003 and 2006, the Ocean Prediction Center's forecasters successfully predicted hurricane-force winds two days in advance 58 percent of the time in the Atlantic and 44 percent in the Pacific. Considering that a successful forecast of hurricane-force winds requires accurate prediction of the timing and intensity of an explosive deepening cyclone, these numbers are impressive.QuikScat data have been instrumental in the ability to forecast hurricane-force extratropical cyclones several days in advance, while they are still well out over the ocean. Forecasters can use the data to determine which numerical weather prediction models are handling a storm the best, thereby improving the accuracy of forecasts and increasing warning lead times. QuikScat data are available to forecasters within three hours of acquisition.The availability of a consistent observing capability for extratropical cyclones from QuikScat has allowed NOAA to add a third \"hurricane-force\" warning category for extratropical cyclone winds, in addition to gale and storm, providing better warnings of a coming storm's severity. The U.S. Coast Guard broadcasts these warnings by radiofax, and they are posted online at: These extratropical cyclone warnings have a great economic impact on the $200 billion global marine shipping industry.Â  A recent study estimates improvements to warning and forecast services due to QuikScat save the container and bulk shipping industry $135 million a year by reducing their exposure to hurricane-force wind conditions in non-tropical storms over the North Pacific and North Atlantic. Without QuikScat, the severity of many extratropical cyclones would not be determined.Â  The data are also vital to the fishing industry, offshore energy industries, search and rescue organizations, and agencies that track and manage marine hazards like oil spills.Paul Chang, ocean winds science team lead at NOAA's National Environmental Satellite, Data and Information Service/Center for Satellite Applications and Research, Camp Springs, Md., said ocean vector wind measurements from QuikScat have become a basic part of NOAA's day-to-day forecasting and warning processes.Â \"The 10 years of observations from the QuikScat mission have provided critical information for the monitoring, modeling, forecasting and research of the atmosphere, oceans and climate,\" he said.Â For more information  about QuickScat, visit"}

Morgan Distinguished Professor at LSU. \"We now have 60 to 84 hour advance forecasting capabilities due to our satellite link-ups with NOAA and our supercomputing capabilities. Because of these advancements, we are in much better shape for the 2009 hurricane season to provide valuable information than we were in the past.\"WAVCIS operates by deploying equipment in the depths of the Gulf of Mexico. Currently, they have sensors attached to numerous oil platforms. Instruments are attached to towers on the platforms and allow meteorological measurements â air temperature, wind speed and direction, visibility â to be made; state-of-the-art oceanographic sensors are placed underwater and on the sea floor.Advanced technology, including the Acoustic Doppler Profiler, an instrument that Stone's group has helped perfect in real time with the private sector, provides a very comprehensive overview of current velocities from the sea bed to the surface in addition to wave conditions on the sea surface.\"In a normal weather situation, WAVCIS links with the satellites and retrieves up-to-date information every hour. This information is then immediately supplied to computer models at LSU's WAVCIS lab and the data are posted on the WAVCIS Web site,\" said Stone. \"However, during a hurricane or other extreme weather events, we have the capacity to increase the frequency of these link-ups.  We won't have the luxury of waiting an hour during the approach of a hurricane â it's critical that we can see what's going on out there in 15 to 30 minute intervals in order to accurately assess the situation.\"The WAVCIS group, a component of LSU's world famous Coastal Studies Institute, has sensors all throughout the Gulf of Mexico. In fact, most of the equipment used by WAVCIS is developed and maintained in-house at the Coastal Studies Institute's fabrication shop. Through a close and reciprocal relationship with NOAA's National Data Buoy Center, WAVCIS can also access that group's sensors, giving the system a gulf-wide look at emerging trends in waves and currents, which can be very important during the approach of a tropical cyclone.\"Things such as the maximum wave height, wind speeds and storm surge, will play an integral role in issues concerning public safety,\" said Stone. \"For example, the development of certain currents, such as the Loop current in the Gulf of Mexico, allows for almost immediate intensification of storms. That's why having an easy-to-understand and comprehensive end product was so important to my team and the Coastal Studies Institute, for example the Earth Scan Lab and the Southern Regional Climate Center, during the development stages. When it's crunch time and people are nervous, we want the facts to be clear.\"In addition to being a very active research group and providing graduate and undergraduate students with hands-on opportunities in an internationally-acclaimed lab, WAVCIS also provides other entities with the opportunity to test their own modeling accuracy. \t\"By looking at the models they developed and then comparing them to ours and our measurements offshore, they can determine how accurate their models currently are and go about fine-tuning if necessary. This strengthens our knowledge of the oceanographic and coastal environment.  Given the vulnerability of, for example coastal Louisiana and the oil and gas infrastructure in the Gulf of Mexico to erosion and hurricane impacts, it is important that the Federal Government, State of Louisiana and the oil and gas industry continue to support this effort,\" Stone said.WAVCIS models are available on"}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_521", "content": "Scientists from the Cooperative Institute for Meteorological Satellite Studies (CIMSS) have developed a way to measure temperature changes in the tops of clouds to improve forecast times for rapidly growing storms.\"The value of detecting and analyzing these changes is that we can get up to a 45-minute jump on radar detection of the same storm system. A 'nowcast' becomes a 'forecast,'\" says CIMSS scientist Wayne Feltz.Clouds start cooling long before radar can identify them as storms. As a warm cumulus cloud grows and expands upward into higher altitudes, it will rapidly cool. Rapid cloud-top cooling indicates that a cloud top is rising into the frigid upper reaches of the atmosphere and can reveal the formation of a severe storm.Cloud temperatures can be measured by the wavelengths of light they radiate in the near-infrared and infrared frequencies. Current geostationary satellites â satellites that stay over the same location on Earth â over the U.S. can discern five different bands in these frequencies, each band revealing a different state of cloud development. Looking down from space, the satellite can determine whether the cloud top consists of liquid water, supercooled water or even ice.By running high-speed five-minute satellite scans through a carefully designed computer algorithm, the scientists can quickly analyze cloud top temperature changes to look for signs of storm formation. \"We are looking for transitions,\" says Feltz. \"Does the cloud top consist of liquid water that is cooling rapidly? That could signal a possible convective initiation.\"Feltz and other CIMSS colleagues, including Kris Bedka and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) scientist Tim Schmit, demonstrated their \"Convective Initiation Nowcast\" and \"Cloud Top Cooling Rate\" products at NOAA's annual Hazardous Weather Testbed (HWT), held May 4-June 5 at the Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Okla.The HWT is designed to accelerate the transition of promising new meteorological insights and technologies into advance forecasting and warnings for hazardous weather events throughout the United States.\"The Hazardous Weather Testbed brings in outside experts in all areas, a melting pot of people to encourage collaboration and interactions and proposal opportunities,\" Feltz says. \"The point of this is working with forecasters in the field â the Weather Service, the Storm Prediction Center, the Hurricane Center â whoever is interested in looking at more advanced satellite products.\""}

Her courses include topics related to wind and earthquakes with guidelines and recommendations for better design and construction in hurricane and earthquake prone areas. Taher also helps prepare architecture graduates for the certifying exam and has authored a book on the topic. In 2007, her article about the design of low-rise buildings for extreme wind events appeared in the Journal of Architectural Engineering.\"Certain home shapes and roof types can make a big difference,\" is a common refrain in all her work.Her recommendations in the forthcoming article should be heeded by anyone building in high wind regions.  They include the following.Design buildings with square, hexagonal or even octagonal floor plans with roofs of multiple slopes such as a four-sloped hip roof. These roofs perform better under wind forces than the gable roofs with two slopes. Gable roofs are common only because they are cheaper to build. Research and testing demonstrate that a 30-degree roof slope will have the best results.Wind forces on a roof tend to uplift it. \"This explains why roofs blow off during extreme wind events,\" Taher said.  To combat uplift, she advises connecting roofs to walls strongly with nails, not staples. Stapled roofs were banned in Florida after Hurricane Andrew. The use of hurricane clips is recommended. The choice of roofing is important. Different roofing systems perform differently under hurricane conditions. In tile roofs, loose tiles often become wind-borne debris threatening other structures.Aim for strong connections between the structure and foundation. Structural failure-- one structural element triggering the collapse of anotherâcan be progressive.Hurricane shutters can protect glazing from wind-borne debris. Various designs are available.Roof overhangs are subject to wind uplift forces which could trigger a roof failure. In the design of the hurricane-resistant home, the length of these overhangs should be limited to about 20 inches.The design of the researched cyclonic home includes simple systems to reduce the local wind stresses at the roof's lower edges such as a notched frieze or a horizontal grid. Install the latter at the level of the gutters along the homes' perimeter.An elevated structure on an open foundation reduces the risk of damage from flooding and storm-driven water. All foundation piles must be strengthened by bracing and should penetrate deep enough into the soil to reduce the risk of scour."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_523", "content": "The Atlantic Ocean Hurricane Season runs from June 1 to November 30. In the eastern Pacific Ocean, Hurricane season runs between May 15 and November 30 each year. These dates simply border the times when most tropical cyclone activity happens in this region. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) National Hurricane Center forecasts tropical cyclones (the generic name for hurricanes, typhoons, tropical storms, tropical depressions) in the eastern Pacific and Atlantic. NASA provides satellite data and conducts tropical cyclone research.NASA has several satellites in orbit around the Earth that are used to study different aspects of these tropical cyclones, and NASA scientists conduct hurricane research all through the year. Satellites include the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission satellite, Aqua, QuikScat, CloudSat, the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES), JASON-1, OSTM/Jason-2, Landsat, and Terra. Except for GOES, which is managed by NOAA, all missions are managed either out of NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Md. or NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif. NASA Goddard's GOES Project Office generates GOES images and animations.Using all of these satellites and their instruments, NASA scientists gather data on many factors that determine if a tropical cyclone may strengthen or weaken. Data includes: storm and surface winds; sea surface heights and temperatures; rainfall intensity and area; lightning; cloud water; water vapor; cloud heights, extent of cloud cover and cloud temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure; cloud development; and size of the storm.NASA data currently indicate that sea surface temperatures in the tropical Atlantic are below normal. These cooler than normal ocean temperatures could \"starve\" developing hurricanes of their driving force, which are waters warmer than 80 degrees Fahrenheit, thus suggesting a damping of hurricanes.Despite Atlantic waters being cooler than normal, the first tropical depression of the Atlantic season formed on May 27 around 11 a.m. EDT in the warmer waters of the Gulf Stream about 310 miles south of Providence, Rhode Island. It then moved away from the mainland U.S. and into cooler waters which led to its dissipation.Meanwhile in the eastern Pacific, the La NiÃ±a conditions of the past few years have faded away. This is also good news for the coming hurricane season, as La NiÃ±a tends to drive the jet stream farther north, decreasing the hurricane damping wind shear over the tropics. The jet stream is a ribbon of fast moving air in the upper troposphere that guides low pressure areas (storms) and fronts.But, it is very early to forecast hurricane activity since much can change during the summer. Will El NiÃ±o develop in the Pacific or will La NiÃ±a make a surprise return? Will the Atlantic warm up over the summer? And there are some wild cards. Since 1995, the Atlantic has entered multi-decadal conditions that favor increased hurricane activity. This loads the dice for more hurricanes.In the Pacific, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation's (PDO) characteristic warm \"horseshoe\" and cool wedge pattern is still strong in the sea surface temperature and sea-level height images. The PDO is a long-term ocean temperature fluctuation of the Pacific Ocean that waxes and wanes approximately every 10 to 20 years.Most recent NASA sea-surface temperature and height data clearly illustrate the persistence of this basin-wide pattern. \"While this PDO pattern tends to make the formation of a new El NiÃ±o event less likely, the warm waters in the western Pacific favor a very active western Pacific typhoon (\"hurricane\" in the eastern Pacific and Atlantic) season and inhibit the hurricane damping condition over the Atlantic and Caribbean,\" said Dr. William Patzert of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif.Patzert sees merit in the cautionary Atlantic hurricane outlook released by NOAA's Climate Prediction Center in May. \"It is the beginning of a long summer and oceanic and atmospheric conditions can change dramatically,\" Patzert said. Statistics and probabilities of today have huge wiggle room.By fall, today's conditions can change. Being vigilant and preparing for a major hurricane is still the best way to prepare for any hurricane season. \"Along hurricane-prone coasts and areas, be ready; you can be clobbered no matter what the expert outlook is today,\" said Patzert.Whenever and wherever a tropical cyclone forms, NASA satellite data will provide data that will help forecasters get a better idea of how it's going to behave."}

They conclude that tropical cyclones could play a key role in adding water vapor to the stratosphere, which has been shown to increase surface temperatures.Because global warming is expected to lead to changes in the frequency and intensity of tropical cyclones, the authors believe their results suggest the possibility of a feedback mechanism between tropical cyclones and global climate."}

Dr Cooper said: âPopulations in the Caribbean, from 5000 BC to AD 1492, successfully lived through a 5m rise in relative sea levels, marked variation in annual rainfall and periodic intensification of hurricane activity.âThis research examines the archaeological lessons that can inform current responses to the impacts of climate change in the Caribbean. I have examined the relationship between long and short-term effects of climate change and past human engagement with the geographical, ecological and meteorological consequences.ââA key focus of the research has been to investigate past mitigation of the impacts of climate change through the analysis of changes in settlement structures, food procurement strategies and household architecture.âThe study is part of a long term project, begun in 1997, that includes a wide-ranging study of archaeological and paleoenvironmental data. Key to the research has been to understand how the past can inform the future.Said Dr Cooper: âWe have acquired archaeological information that has then been closely correlated in space and time with the long and short-term impacts of climate change. It has then been possible to evaluate the relative advantages and disadvantages of past cultural practices in the face of environmental change and establish lessons that will contribute to contemporary mitigation strategies. âFollowing the end of the last Ice Age, the people of the Caribbean have had to cope with a relative sea level rise of 5m over 5,000 years. Hurricanes led to storm surges that reached inland more than ever. Groundwater became contaminated with salt and the land was waterlogged.But the researchers found that far from abandoning life by the coast and moving further inland, people continued to live by the shore- and even built houses on stilts over a lagoon.An ancient site in Cuba, Los Buchillones, that is currently out to sea ârepresents a way of living that capitalises on hundreds or even thousands of years of experience.âDr Cooper warns that modern settlements are more at risk of flooding because they are constructed in more vulnerable places. In fact, indigenous settlement locations over water could make homes less at risk of flooding as floodwater could flow beneath the homes and inland rather than pour into the houses.This ongoing research has looked at past mitigation strategies, assessed how pre-Colombian settlements were located close to cave complexes that acted as refuges during times of past hurricanes, how the architecture of homes were constructed from local resources allowing people to rebuild them easily upon their return.

Many of them now have their own cell phones.âOf the 37 individuals treated for carbon monoxide poisoning after the storm, 20 were under the age of 20. In nine of those cases, researchers were able to speak with families to determine why a generator was being used. In 75 percent of those cases, the generator was used to run video games. The data are published in the June 1 issue of the Journal of Pediatrics.All of the patients were treated at Memorial Hermann-Texas Medical Center, the only hospital in Houston with a hyperbaric oxygen treatment center that is capable of treating patients with carbon monoxide poisoning.Carbon monoxide is a product of combustion of organic matter with an insufficient oxygen supply. When kept inside the home generators give off carbon monoxide and people can begin breathing it in causing symptoms such as headaches, nausea and flu-like effects. If exposed for a longer length of time, death can occur. Carbon monoxide poisoning is the most common cause of poisoning death in the United States. A hyperbaric chamber is used to give 100 percent oxygen under increased atmospheric pressure to patients exposed to carbon monoxide.âDiscovering that generators are so frequently used to power entertainment devices for children suggests that school programs should be considered in states at risk for hurricane-related power outages,â Fife said. âWe also learned that using cell phone providers to send out text messages might be effective.

The annual amount of carbon dioxide a forest removes from the atmosphere is determined by the ratio of tree growth to tree mortality each year.When trees are destroyed en masse by hurricanes, not only will there be fewer trees in the forest to absorb greenhouse gases, but forests could eventually become emitters of carbon dioxide, warming the climate. And other studies, notes Tulane ecologist Jeff Chambers, indicate that hurricanes will intensify with a warming climate.âIf landfalling hurricanes become more intense or more frequent in the future, tree mortality and damage exceeding 50 million tons of tree biomass per year would result in a net carbon loss from U.S. forest ecosystems,â says Chambers.The study, which was led by Tulane postdoctoral research associate Hongcheng Zeng, establishes an important baseline to evaluate changes in the frequency and intensity of future landfalling hurricanes.Using field measurements, satellite image analyses, and empirical models to evaluate forest and carbon cycle impacts, the researchers established that an average of 97 million trees have been affected each year for the past 150 years over the entire United States, resulting in a 53-million ton annual biomass loss and an average carbon release of 25 million tons. Forest impacts were primarily located in Gulf Coast areas, particularly southern Texas and Louisiana and south Florida, while significant impacts also occurred in eastern North Carolina.Chambers compares the data from this study to a 2007 study that showed that a single storm â Hurricane Katrina -- destroyed nearly 320 million trees with a total biomass loss equivalent to 50â140 percent of the net annual U.S. carbon sink in forest trees.âThe bottom line,â says Chambers, âis that any sustained increase in hurricane tree biomass loss above 50 million tons would potentially undermine our efforts to reduce human fossil fuel carbon emissions.âStudy contributors include Tulane lab researchers Robinson NegrÃ³n-JuÃ¡rez and David Baker; George Hurtt of the Institute for the Study of Earth, Oceans, and Space at the University of New Hampshire; and Mark Powell at the Hurricane Research Division, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

Â The previous four reports by the NAE and Research Council examined various draft volumes of the IPET.Â  This report reviews the 7,500-page IPET draft final report, reflects upon the lessons learned from Katrina, and offers advice for how to improve the hurricane-protection system in the New Orleans area.Â Although some of the report's recommendations to enhance hurricane preparedness have been widely acknowledged for years, many have not been adequately implemented, said the committee that wrote the report.Â  For instance, levees and floodwalls should be viewed as a way to reduce risks from hurricanes and storm surges, not as measures that completely eliminate risk.Â  As with any structure built to protect against flooding, the New Orleans hurricane-protection system promoted a false sense of security that areas behind the structures were absolutely safe for habitation and development, the report says.Â  Unfortunately, there are substantial risks that never were adequately communicated to the public and undue optimism that the 350-mile structure network could provide reliable flood protection, the committee noted.Comprehensive flood planning and risk management should be based on a combination of structural and nonstructural measures, including the option of voluntary relocations, floodproofing and elevation of structures, and evacuation, the committee urged.Â  Rebuilding the New Orleans area and its hurricane-protection system to its pre-Katrina state would leave the city and its inhabitants vulnerable to similar disasters.Â  Instead, settlement in areas most vulnerable to flooding should be discouraged, and some consideration should be given to new designs of the New Orleans metro hurricane-protection system.Â  As part of the future design, relocation of some structures and residents would help improve public safety and reduce flood damages.Â For structures in hazardous areas and residents who do not relocate, the committee recommended major floodproofing measures -- such as elevating the first floor of buildings to at least the 100-year flood level and strengthening electric power, water, gas, and telecommunication supplies.Â  Also, a comprehensive evacuation program should be established that includes well-designed and tested evacuation plans; improved local and regional shelters that would make evacuations less imposing; and long-term strategies that could enhance the efficiency of evacuations, such as locating facilities for the ill and elderly away from hazardous areas.Â Furthermore, the 100-year flood level -- which is a crucial flood insurance standard -- is inadequate for flood protection structures in heavily populated areas such as New Orleans, where the failure of the system would be catastrophic.Â  Use of this standard in the New Orleans area has escalated the costs of protection, encouraged settlement in areas behind levees, and resulted in losses of life and vast federal expenditures following numerous flood and hurricane disasters, the committee said.Â Regarding IPET's draft final report, the committee concluded that it contained important advances in characterizing and understanding the nature of Gulf hurricane storm surges and waves -- in particular explaining the storm surge generated by Hurricane Katrina, how waters from the surge entered the New Orleans metro region, and the amount of flooding across the city. Â In addition, IPET's studies have made significant contributions to simulating hurricane impacts, characterizing the collective effects of hurricane damage, and improving knowledge of regional vulnerability to hurricanes and storm surge.However, the final IPET report should provide a better explanation of its methods to evaluate flood risks, the committee said.Â  The final report also should be written in a more clear and organized manner, using layman's terminology that can be understood by the public and officials. Â Such clarity is lacking in Volume VIII, which was the principal focus of the final two years of IPET's study.Â  This volume assesses the risks posed by future tropical storms and contains inundation maps that show the areas at most risk for future flooding.Â  These maps are important to citizens, businesses, and government agencies for planning resettlement and redevelopment in the region, but the volume contains limited discussion of the implications of these maps.Â  Moreover, at times the extensive technical information presented in the volume overshadows key results.The committee also recommended that a professional technical firm prepare a second document for the public and officials that would be shorter and focus on explaining IPET report results and implications for reconstruction and resettlement.Â"}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_529", "content": "The heavily populated coast of Guadeloupe will have little warning if a tsunami is triggered by the collapse of a volcano on the nearby island of Dominica.A team of geologists, led by Dr Richard Teeuw from the University of Portsmouth, have discovered that a flank of the volcano Morne aux Diables (\"Devils' Peak\") shows signs of collapse and if so, a million-ton chunk of rock could crash into the sea, producing tsunami waves up to almost 3 metres (10 feet) high.Such a rock fall could also weaken three million tones of rock upslope, potentially resulting in much larger landslides and waves of up to five metres.Â Dr Teeuw said: âItâs not a case of if this landslide and tsunami will happen, but when. The trigger will probably be a major earthquake, occurring after the heavy rain and coastal erosion of the hurricane season.Â  It could happen in a hundred years or it could happen next week.Â âGuadeloupe is a densely populated island with popular tourist beaches, many of which are wide with low angle gradients, which leads to âtsunami run-upâ and increased wave heights. In places, there is no protection from coral reef which otherwise might absorb some of the tsunami wave energy.âThere would be damage to property and if people were on the beach then there could be loss of life.Â  This part of the world is well-prepared for hurricane hazards, but is relatively unprepared for the rapid impact of a tsunami.âThe vulnerable area of rock was left exposed several thousand years ago when the flank of the volcano collapsed into the sea. Dr Teeuw will study the seabed for evidence of an ancient tsunami next year. Since the original collapse, coastal erosion has undercut cliffs along the over-steepened margin of the volcano, leaving the remaining flank of the volcano unstable.Â Dr Teeuw and colleagues made their discovery after carrying out geomorphological surveys backed up by 3-D images from Google Earth which show clearly visible tension cracks. The results convinced them that they were looking at a serious landslide and tsunami hazard.Â The Guadeloupe archipelago is about 50 kilometres north of Dominica and tsunami waves would hit its shores within minutes of the volcanoâs collapse, giving little chance to warn people on the coast.Â Â Â Â The island of Dominica has the highest concentrations of potentially active volcanoes in the world.Â  The area is regularly exposed to hurricanes and occasional severe seismic activity.Dr Teeuw and his team of students and geoscientists will return to Dominica this summer, part-funded by the Royal Geographical Society, for further geomorphological surveys, to better understand the probable size of the various landslide zones on the flanks of Morne aux Diable.Â A further survey is planned for 2010, when the seafloor along the margin of the volcano will be examined, allowing better estimates of the likely tsunami hazard. Examining the age of the sediment on the seabed will also help to determine when past coastal landslides occurred.Â Â Dr Teeuw said: âThe earthquake associated with the ancient flank-collapse of Morne aux Diables volcano was probably much larger than any experienced around Dominica in historical times. If so, that has serious implications, raising the possibility of rare, but catastrophic, tsunami waves in the Caribbean region.âDr Teeuw wants to raise awareness about potential tsunami hazards to emergency planners, disaster managers and the people of Guadeloupe and Dominica to help reduce their vulnerability and the risk of disaster.He made the discovery while supervising student research projects around Morne aux Diables volcano and his work, published in the newsletter of the American Geophysical Union ("}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_530", "content": "The finding, published in \"Since water vapor is an important greenhouse gas, an increase of water vapor in the stratosphere would warm the Earth's surface,\" says David M. Romps, a research associate in Harvard's Department of Earth and Planetary Science. \"Our finding that tropical cyclones are responsible for many of the clouds in the stratosphere opens up the possibility that these storms could affect global climate, in addition to the oft-mentioned possibility of climate change affecting the frequency and intensity of tropical cyclones.\"Romps and co-author Zhiming Kuang, assistant professor of climate science in Harvard's Faculty of Arts and Sciences, were intrigued by earlier data suggesting that the amount of water vapor in the stratosphere has grown by roughly 50 percent over the past 50 years. Scientists are currently unsure why this increase has occurred; the Harvard researchers sought to examine the possibility that tropical cyclones might have contributed by sending a large fraction of their clouds into the stratosphere.Using infrared satellite data gathered from 1983 to 2006, Romps and Kuang analyzed towering cloud tops associated with thousands of tropical cyclones, many of them near the Philippines, Mexico, and Central America. Their analysis demonstrated that in a cyclone, narrow plumes of miles-tall storm clouds can rise so explosively through the atmosphere that they often push into the stratosphere.Romps and Kuang found that tropical cyclones are twice as likely as other storms to punch into the normally cloud-free stratosphere, and four times as likely to inject ice deep into the stratosphere.\"It is ... widely believed that global warming will lead to changes in the frequency and intensity of tropical cyclones,\" Romps and Kuang write in Geophysical Research Letters. \"Therefore, the results presented here establish the possibility for a feedback between tropical cyclones and global climate.\"Typically, very little water is allowed passage through the stratosphere's lower boundary, known as the tropopause. Located some 6 to 11 miles above the Earth's surface, the tropopause is the coldest part of the Earth's atmosphere, making it a barrier to the lifting of water vapor into the stratosphere: As air passes slowly through the tropopause, it gets so cold that most of its water vapor freezes out and falls away.But if very deep clouds, such as those in a tropical cyclone that can rise through the atmosphere at speeds of up to 40 miles per hour, can punch through the tropopause too quickly for this to happen, they can deposit their ice in the warmer overlying stratosphere, where it then evaporates.\"This suggests that tropical cyclones could play an important role in setting the humidity of the stratosphere,\" Romps and Kuang write.Romps and Kuang's research was funded by the Eppley Foundation and NASA."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_531", "content": "About 15 percent of the world's tropical cyclones occur in the northern Indian Ocean, but because of high population densities along low-lying coastlines, the storms have caused nearly 80 percent of cyclone-related deaths around the world. Incomplete atmospheric data for the Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea make it difficult for regional forecasters to provide enough warning for mass evacuations.In the wake of last year's Cyclone Nargis -- one of the most catastrophic cyclones on record -- a team of NASA researchers re-examined the storm as a test case for a new data integration and mathematical modeling approach. They compiled satellite data from the days leading up to the May 2 landfall of the storm and successfully \"hindcasted\" Nargis' path and landfall in Burma.\"Hindcasting\" means that the modelers plotted the precise course of the storm. In addition, the retrospective results showed how forecasters might now be able to produce multi-day advance warnings in the Indian Ocean and improve advance forecasts in other parts of the world. Results from their study were published March 26 in Geophysical Research Letters.\"There is no event in nature that causes a greater loss of life than Northern Indian Ocean cyclones, so we have a strong motivation to improve advance warnings,\" said the study's lead author, Oreste Reale, an atmospheric modeler with the Goddard Earth Sciences and Technology Center, a partnership between NASA and the University of Maryland-Baltimore County.In late April 2008, weather forecasters tracking cyclone Nargis initially predicted the storm would make landfall in Bangladesh. But the storm veered unexpectedly to the east and intensified from a category 1 storm to a category 4 in just 24 hours. When it made landfall in Burma (Myanmar) on May 2, the storm and its surge killed more than 135,000 people, displaced tens of thousands, and destroyed about $12 billion in property.In the months that followed, Reale and his U.S.-based team tested the NASA-created Data Assimilation and Forecasting System known as GEOS-5 and its NASA/NOAA-created analysis technique using data from the days leading up to Nargis because the storm was particularly fatal and highly characteristic of cyclones in the northern Indian Ocean.Cyclones in the Bay of Bengal â stretching from the southern tip of India to Thailand â are particularly difficult to analyze because of \"blind spots\" in available atmospheric data for individual storms, as well as the small dimensions of the Bay, which ensure that storms do not have much time to develop or circulate. In most instances, regionally strong wind shear suppresses cyclone development.But when tropical cyclones do form, flooding waves and storm surges can quickly reach the narrow basin's shores. And that unusual wind shear, which is fueled by large temperature contrasts between sea and land, can also lead to erratic storm tracks. Forecasting is also made particularly difficult by the \"blind spots,\" Reale noted. Land-based weather stations monitor the edges of the bay, but they cannot see much when a storm is brewing several hundred miles from the coastline.Forecasters from the India Meteorological Department and the U.S. Navy's Joint Typhoon Warning Center lack access to the fleet of \"hurricane hunting\" airplanes that fly through Atlantic storms. They have to rely on remote satellite measurements that can only assess atmospheric and ocean temperatures under \"clear-sky,\" or cloudless, conditions -- not exactly common in the midst of a cyclone.In their modeling experiment, Reale's team detected and tracked Nargis' path by employing novel 3-dimensional satellite imagery and atmospheric profiles from the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) instrument aboard NASA's Aqua satellite to see into the heart of the storm.AIRS has become increasingly important to weather forecasting because of its ability to show changes in atmospheric temperature and moisture at varying altitudes. Until recently, many weather modelers were only using AIRS data from cloud-free skies.In 2007, atmospheric scientist Joel Susskind of NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Md., successfully demonstrated through a technique developed by NASA research scientist Moustafa Chahine that accurate atmospheric temperatures could be obtained using real (versus hypothetical data in a 2003 Susskind study) AIRS partly-cloudy data. Reale's team used the temperature data products from Susskind's work to run the NASA model with the added information from partially-cloudy areas of sky that traditionally got left out.AIRS cloudy-sky data can now be integrated into what are called shared data assimilation systems, which combine millions of data points from Earth-observing satellites, instrumented ocean buoys, ground-based sensors, aircraft-based instruments, and man-on-the-scene observations. Data assimilation transforms the data into digital local maps that models can \"read\" to produce either hindcasts or advance projections of future weather conditions.Lau, chief of Goddard's Laboratory for Atmospheres, believes that regional forecasting agencies monitoring the region can readily access AIRS' data daily and optimize forecasts for cyclones in the Indian Ocean. According to Lau, the same technique can be useful to forecasts of hurricanes in the Atlantic and typhoons in the western Pacific, particularly when the storm is formed over open oceans out of flight range of hurricane-hunting airplanes.\"With this approach, we can now better define cyclones at the early stages and track them in the models to know what populations may be most at risk,\" explained Reale. \"And every 12 hours we gain in these forecasts means a gain in our chances to reduce loss of life.\""}

Hispaniola is the second-largest and most populated island of the Antilles. It's located between Cuba to its west, and Puerto Rico to its east.Hispaniola, famous as Columbus' first stop in the \"New World\" in 1492, has often been the target of Atlantic hurricanes. In 1979 Hurricane David claimed more than a thousand lives. On this mountainous island, landslides and flooding are usually the major causes of destruction. \"Located right in the center of 'hurricane alley,' Hispaniola has a long and brutal history of hurricane destruction,\" notes climatologist Bill Patzert, Climatologist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif. \"Haiti, one of the poorest countries in the Western Hemisphere, suffers from severe environmental degradation which makes hurricane landfalls especially damaging and deadly,\" Patzert added.NASA satellites tracked and recorded many aspects of the tropical cyclones that hit Hispaniola. Satellites including: Aqua, CloudSat, Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES), Landsat, QuikScat, Terra and the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM).Lake Enriqullo, located in the southwestern corner of the Dominican Republic, increased in size from all of the rainfall from the tropical cyclones. Two satellite images of the lake's increase in size were captured by the Landsat satellite. Landsat is a joint NASA / U.S. Geological Survey series of Earth-observing satellites that's been in operation since 1972. This natural color image is a combination of a Landsat 7 image from August 2, 2007 and an image from August 20, 2008 shows the lake's expansion colored red. The red area reveals that the lake has increased in size, especially along its eastern- and westernmost edges, and the reduced surface area of Lake Enriqullo's central island indicates greater water volume.Fay was an unusual tropical cyclone because it had eight landfalls, four of them in Florida alone. Fay's torrential rainfall caused extensive floods across the Dominican Republic, Haiti, Cuba, and Florida. After a landfall in Hispaniola on Aug. 15, and despite its course over the mountainous southern portion of the Dominican Republic and Haiti, Fay remained a tropical storm. According to the National Hurricane Center's final report on Fay, \"Water levels in reservoirs had been running low and water restrictions were about to be implemented. Fayâs motion across the northern Caribbean Sea produced prolonged heavy rain events in Hispaniola and Cuba. News reports indicate that floods devastated the Haitian island of GonavÃ©. The saturated ground conditions created by the heavy rains from Fay set the stage for an even greater flood devastation and resultant loss of life caused by heavy rains produced by Hurricanes Gustav, Hanna, and Ike that traversed Haiti during the ensuing two weeks. In the Dominican Republic, rainfall totals exceeding 7-10 inches occurred primarily over the southern half of the country.\"Hurricane Gustav crossed onto Haiti's southern peninsula on Aug. 26, 2008 as a Category 1 storm with 70 mph winds that killed at least one person. Gustav's rains caused a landslide near the Haitian town of Brazillienne, and floodwaters split the town of Jacmel in half where it made landfall. According to the National Hurricane Center's final storm report, \"Heavy rainfall and widespread freshwater flooding occurred along the path of Gustav. Camp Perrin, Haiti reported a storm total rainfall of 10.75 inches, while Baharona, Dominican Republic reported a storm total rainfall of 9.71 inches.\" Gustav had formed only one day before about 260 miles southeast of Port-au-Prince, Haiti.Just one week later on Sept. 3, Tropical Storm Hanna dumped very heavy rainfall totals of much of Hispaniola and Puerto Rico as its center passed just north and northwest of those islands. The maximum rainfall reported in the Dominican Republic was 14.17 inches at the town of Oviedo. Haitian residents were forced onto rooftops to avoid serious flooding. Haiti's deforested hillsides were the victim of mudslides from torrential rains. Hanna had killed 21 people and cut off the city of Gonaives with flood waters.Hurricane Ike bore down on Cuba after roaring across low-lying islands on Sept. 7 tearing apart houses, wiping out crops and worsening floods in Haiti that had already killed more than 300 people. Heavy rains also pelted the Dominican Republic, Haiti's neighbor on the island of Hispaniola, where about 4,000 people were evacuated from northern coastal towns.According to the National Hurricane Center's final report on Ike, \"Parts of Hispaniola, especially Haiti, were devastated by widespread flooding and mud slides from four consecutive impacts by Tropical Storm Fay and Hurricanes Gustav, Hanna, and Ike. Overall, 793 people died in Haiti from the four storms, with another 300 people reported missing. It is estimated that 74 deaths are directly attributable to the effects of Ike. Ike exacerbated the humanitarian disaster in Haiti, wiping out the food supply, shelter, and transportation networks across the nation. Two deaths have been reported in the Dominican Republic.\"NASA's Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite has been measuring rainfall from space ever since it was launched in November 1997. The TRMM analysis above shows a complete history of rainfall with Hurricane Ike from when it was named on Sept. 1, 2008, through Sept. 15, 2008.Only rainfall data attributed to Hurricane Ike were used in the TRMM calibrated rainfall analysis. Merged rainfall Data (3B42) from TRMM, other NASA satellites, U.S. Department of Defense satellites, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration polar-orbiting satellites, and geostationary satellites were used in the analysis.The low pressure system that ambled its way slowly over the Dominican Republic on Sept. 23â24 became Kyle after leaving Hispaniola. According to the National Hurricane Center report on Kyle, \"The low took two days to cross the island, producing disorganized thunderstorms and a large area of squalls within a convective band over the adjacent Caribbean Sea.\" It became a tropical depression on Sept. 25, 100 miles north of the Dominican Republic and later became Kyle. Over Hispaniola, the low brought heavy rains, flash floods and mud slides.While residents of Hispaniola are hoping for a calmer hurricane season in 2009, NASA satellites will be keeping a close eye on the Atlantic Ocean basin."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_533", "content": "Since 1980, the tropical North Atlantic has been warming by an average of a quarter-degree Celsius (a half-degree Fahrenheit) per decade. Though this number sounds small, it can translate to big impacts on hurricanes, which thrive on warmer water, says Amato Evan, a researcher with the University of Wisconsin-Madison's Cooperative Institute for Meteorological Satellite Studies and lead author of the new study. For example, the ocean temperature difference between 1994, a quiet hurricane year, and 2005's record-breaking year of storms, was just one degree Fahrenheit.More than two-thirds of this upward trend in recent decades can be attributed to changes in African dust storm and tropical volcano activity during that time, report Evan and his colleagues at UW-Madison and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in a new paper. Their findings will appear in an upcoming issue of the journal Evan and his colleagues have previously shown that African dust and other airborne particles can suppress hurricane activity by reducing how much sunlight reaches the ocean and keeping the sea surface cool. Dusty years predict mild hurricane seasons, while years with low dust activity â including 2004 and 2005 â have been linked to stronger and more frequent storms.In the new study, they combined satellite data of dust and other particles with existing climate models to evaluate the effect on ocean temperature. They calculated how much of the Atlantic warming observed during the last 26 years can be accounted for by concurrent changes in African dust storms and tropical volcanic activity, primarily the eruptions of El ChichÃ³n in Mexico in 1982 and Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines in 1991.In fact, it is a surprisingly large amount, Evan says. \"A lot of this upward trend in the long-term pattern can be explained just by dust storms and volcanoes,\" he says. \"About 70 percent of it is just being forced by the combination of dust and volcanoes, and about a quarter of it is just from the dust storms themselves.\"The result suggests that only about 30 percent of the observed Atlantic temperature increases are due to other factors, such as a warming climate. While not discounting the importance of global warming, Evan says this adjustment brings the estimate of global warming impact on Atlantic more into line with the smaller degree of ocean warming seen elsewhere, such as the Pacific.\"This makes sense, because we don't really expect global warming to make the ocean [temperature] increase that fast,\" he says.Volcanoes are naturally unpredictable and thus difficult to include in climate models, Evan says, but newer climate models will need to include dust storms as a factor to accurately predict how ocean temperatures will change.\"We don't really understand how dust is going to change in these climate projections, and changes in dust could have a really good effect or a really bad effect,\" he says.Satellite research of dust-storm activity is relatively young, and no one yet understands what drives dust variability from year to year. However, the fundamental role of the temperature of the tropical North Atlantic in hurricane formation and intensity means that this element will be critical to developing a better understanding of how the climate and storm patterns may change.\"Volcanoes and dust storms are really important if you want to understand changes over long periods of time,\" Evan says. \"If they have a huge effect on ocean temperature, they're likely going to have a huge effect on hurricane variability as well.\"The new paper is coauthored by Ralf Bennartz and Daniel Vimont of UW-Madison and Andrew Heidinger and James Kossin of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and UW-Madison."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_534", "content": "The topic has local interest because it has recently been observed that significant erosion is occurring on New Orleans area levees primarily caused by seepage driven flow.Recently work began by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to plug in the shipping channel known as the Mississippi River-Gulf Outlet Canal (MRGO) that extends for 76 miles from New Orleans through wetlands to the Gulf of Mexico. The erosion of thousands of acres of cypress wetlands and marsh caused by the channel has been blamed for increased storm surge during Hurricane Katrina in 2005.âOur theory would suggest that seepage caused by underwater flow will continue to erode and weaken the levee system around New Orleans, but the rate of this erosion should gradually slow with time,â says Straub.Â  âHopefully this research will aid the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in identifying levees that need repair and assessing the lifespan of structures like the MRGO that are not planned for upkeep.âUsing fieldwork conducted in the Florida Panhandle, Straub and his fellow researchers were able to better understand the process of seepage erosion, which occurs when the re-emergence of groundwater at the surface shapes the Earth's topography. In the The paper suggests that the velocity at which channel heads advance is proportional to the flux of groundwater to the heads. The researchers used field observations and numerical modeling to come up with the theory. To demonstrate how it works, they created computer animations depicting how the network of deep ravines in Florida grew over time.Straub says that this theory of growth laws for seepage driven channels can also be applied to better understand the topographical features of planet Mars, as well as Earth.âWithin earth science, the subject is of interest because of its fundamental role in sculpting landscapes. The animations provide an explicit answer to the age-old question of how particularly striking and visually attractive erosional features on Earth's surface attained their modern form,â explains Straub. âThe problem is of topical interest in planetary science because channelized features on Mars are thought, but not proven, to have arisen from groundwater flow.â"}

{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_536", "content": "Jianjun Yin, a climate modeler at the Center for Ocean-Atmospheric Prediction Studies (COAPS) at Florida State, said there is a better than 90 percent chance that the sea level rise along this heavily populated coast will exceed the mean global sea level rise by the year 2100. The rising waters in this region -- perhaps by as much as 18 inches or more -- can be attributed to thermal expansion and the slowing of the North Atlantic Ocean circulation because of warmer ocean surface temperatures.Yin and colleagues Michael Schlesinger of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and Ronald Stouffer of Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory at Princeton University are the first to reach that conclusion after analyzing data from 10 state-of-the-art climate models, which have been used for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report. Yin's study is published in the journal \"The northeast coast of the United States is among the most vulnerable regions to future changes in sea level and ocean circulation, especially when considering its population density and the potential socioeconomic consequences of such changes,\" Yin said. \"The most populous states and cities of the United States and centers of economy, politics, culture and education are located along that coast.\"The researchers found that the rapid sea-level rise occurred in all climate models whether they depicted low, medium or high rates of greenhouse-gas emissions. In a medium greenhouse-gas emission scenario, the New York City coastal area would see an additional rise of about 8.3 inches above the mean sea level rise that is expected around the globe because of human-induced climate change.Thermal expansion and the melting of land ice, such as the Greenland ice sheet, are expected to cause the global sea-level rise. The researchers projected the global sea-level rise of 10.2 inches based on thermal expansion alone. The contribution from the land ice melting was not assessed in this study due to uncertainty.Considering that much of the metropolitan region of New York City is less than 16 feet above the mean sea level, with some parts of lower Manhattan only about 5 feet above the mean sea level, a rise of 8.3 inches in addition to the global mean rise would pose a threat to this region, especially if a hurricane or winter storm surge occurs, Yin said.Potential flooding is just one example of coastal hazards associated with sea-level rise, Yin said, but there are other concerns as well. The submersion of low-lying land, erosion of beaches, conversion of wetlands to open water and increase in the salinity of estuaries all can affect ecosystems and damage existing coastal development.Although low-lying Florida and Western Europe are often considered the most vulnerable to sea level changes, the northeast U.S. coast is particularly vulnerable because the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) is susceptible to global warming. The AMOC is the giant circulation in the Atlantic with warm and salty seawater flowing northward in the upper ocean and cold seawater flowing southward at depth. Global warming could cause an ocean surface warming and freshening in the high-latitude North Atlantic, preventing the sinking of the surface water, which would slow the AMOC."}

However, Nargis  passed over a pre-existing warm ocean feature in the Bay of Bengal where upper  ocean warm waters extended deeper than normal, from 73 to 101 meters (240 to 331 feet).\"This abnormally thick, warm water layer, which formed about a month earlier,  kept deeper, colder waters from being drawn to the surface, increasing the energy  available to fuel Nargis' growth by 300 percent,\" said Lin. \"Combined with other  atmospheric conditions conducive to strengthening, this warm ocean feature allowed  Nargis to reach speeds of 115 knots [213 kilometers, or 132 miles, per hour] at  landfall. Had Nargis not encountered this warm ocean feature, it would likely not  have had sufficient energy to intensify rapidly.\"Nargis' rapid intensification occurred predominantly over warm ocean regions where  sea surface temperatures ranged between 30 and 30.2 degrees Celsius (about 86 degrees  Fahrenheit) and sea surface heights ranged from 6 to 20 centimeters (2.4 to 7.9 inches)  above normal. Between May 1 and 2, 2008, the storm intensified from category 1 to  category 4. When Nargis briefly passed outside the warm ocean region on May 2, it  weakened somewhat, only to strengthen once again as it returned to the warm ocean  feature. Warm ocean features in the Gulf of Mexico contributed to the rapid intensification  of hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005.Lin said the research will contribute to improving our understanding of and ability  to forecast catastrophic events like Nargis in the future, reducing loss of life and  property. \"Such a capability is particularly needed in developing countries, where  less advanced cyclone monitoring and warning systems can leave people with little  time to escape from disaster,\" she said.The scientists compared the thermal structure of the upper ocean waters within the  warm ocean feature during the storm with its thermal structure under normal climatological  conditions. Study data came from the international Argo float program, NASA's  Jason-1 satellite, the European Space Agency's Environmental Satellite, the U.S.  Navy's GEOSAT Follow-On satellite and NOAA's Global Temperature and Salinity Profile  Program data base. The satellite data were used to derive the upper ocean thermal  structure for regions where no suitable direct measurements were available.\"This research demonstrates a significant potential benefit of using altimeter data for  operational weather forecasting and tropical cyclone intensity predictions,\" said study  co-author Tim Liu of JPL. \"Current hurricane analyses include variations in ocean heat,  which can be revealed by ocean altimeters. Satellites like NASA's Jason-1 and Ocean  Surface Topography Mission/Jason-2 make important contributions to the operational  monitoring and prediction of tropical cyclones, as have other NASA satellites.\"Results of the study were published this month in Geophysical Research Letters.For more information on Jason-1 and NASA's satellite altimetry programs, visit:"}

Hurricane Katrina displaced thousands and severely disrupted access to health care. Researchers monitored enrollees of a New Orleans-area managed care organization and found morbidity rates increased 12.6 percent compared with 3.4 percent nationwide. âIn the year following Hurricane Katrina, morbidity rates increased substantially,â said Lynda Burton, ScD, lead author of the study and adjunct associate professor with the Bloomberg Schoolâs Department of Health Policy and Management. âMorbidity rates among non-white Orleans residents were the highest when compared to other parishes and there was a significant increase in the prevalence of patients with cardiac diagnoses, congestive heart failure and sleep problems.Â  Survivors displaced out-of-state experienced higher morbidity rates than those not displaced. In the month following the disaster, mortality spiked, but during the remainder of the year returned to a level consistent with the previous year.âResearchers examined the managed care organization claims of 20,612 white and non-white residents of Orleans, Jefferson, St. Tammany and Plaquemines parishes who were over the age of 65 and enrolled in Peoples Health, a provider-owned managed care organization. Burton, along with colleagues from the Bloomberg School, Health Data Essentials, Inc. and the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, conducted an observational study to compare mortality, morbidity and services used for one year before and after Hurricane Katrina. The researchers found that emergency department visits increased 100 percent in the month following Katrina, and by 21 percent over the next year compared to the pre-Katrina year.Â  Hospitalization rates increased 66 percent in the first month after Katrina and maintained an increase of 23 percent over the ensuing year.Â  Using a telephone survey, the study also examined the health of a random sample of enrollees after the hurricane.Â  Researchers believe displacement played a major role in health outcomes. Sixty-nine percent reported moderate or severe damage to their home, or that their home was destroyed.Â  At the end of the year, 28 percent reported their residence remained unlivable and another 28 percent reported a worse financial situation.âThe enormous health burden experienced by older individuals and the disruptions in service utilization reveal the long-term effects of Hurricane Katrina on this vulnerable population,â said Jonathan Weiner, DrPH, senior author of the study and director of the Bloomberg Schoolâs PhD Program in Health Services Research and Policy. âAlthough quick rebuilding of the provider network may have attenuated more severe health outcomes for this managed care population, new policies must be introduced to deal with the health consequences of a major disaster.âThe research was funded by Peoples Health."}

A professor at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) is set for six months of overseas research aimed at making it a reality, now.UAB Associate Professor of Engineering Nasim Uddin, Ph.D., and his collaborators are behind the innovative work. Beginning Nov. 22, Uddin will spend six months in Bangladesh as a visiting lecturer and researcher at the BRAC University. Uddin will work to strengthen the universityâs post graduate-program in disaster mitigation while he furthers his ongoing research into natural fiber-based composite technologies for low-cost residential coastal housing, engineered to withstand hurricane strength wind and storm surge damage. The trip is funded by a Fulbright Scholarship grant and is an extension of more than six years worth of UAB based research funded by more than $1 million in National Science Foundation grants.âCoastal people everywhere face serious threats, but imagine if we can build a home that would still be there after the storm,â Uddin said.While in Bangladesh, Uddin will work with local educators and researchers to study the feasibility, reliability and livability of low cost coastal housing designed to endure hurricanes using environmentally friendly composite building technology. The technology weaves fibers from the jute tree, one of Bangladeshâs most common and thriving plants, with plastics to form an ultra-strong building material. Uddinâs ongoing research with co-principal investigators Professors Uday Vaidya, Ph.D., and Fouad Fouad, Ph.D., has focused on a similar composite material, but one that relies on glass fibers rather than natural tree fibers.âThe idea in Bangladesh is to find what we can do to design a more green material that is locally available at a substantially lower cost when compared to alternative building materials, and that is substantially stronger than the homes and structures currently being built along the coastline,â Uddin said. âWe will learn if these jute fiber homes are livable, and weâll try to resolve any architectural issues, getting a step closer to the real implementation or construction of such homes for people battered by centuries of deadly storms.âUddin said the technology is light weight and also could help the structures survive hurricane storm surge and the resulting flooding, by essentially allowing the buildings to float on the rising tide once uplift pressures from climbing water levels force the structures free from their foundations.Uddin said that while this next phase of his fiber-composite research is taking place overseas, the technology, if it proves viable, will have tangible benefits for the coastal regions of United States, including parts of Alabama.âThe potential payoff of this program could be the rapid insertion of the tree-fiber technology into the rebuilding and future construction of homes in the Gulf Coast states, especially in flood and storm prone areas like Mobile and New Orleans,â Uddin said.Uddin said that Bangladesh is the ideal country for his research. The Asian nation is one of the most disaster prone and densely populated in the world, offering a unique opportunity to better understand the potential real-world applications of the tree-fiber composite technology in construction. Also, he stressed that the BRAC University he will partner with is a part of one of the worldâs largest non-governmental development organizations with the established network and infrastructure needed to implement the fiber-technology program at the grass roots level.âThis is a poor country with an extremely poor coastal community that is completely devastated by these storms,â Uddin said. âA single storm can kill millions. So if our technology can be applied there successfully, you can see how many lives it could save in U.S. cities or anywhere else.â"}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_544", "content": "Subsequent statistical analysis of data generated for the last 60 years revealed no direct correlation between global warming and the incidence of polar lows.Polar lows are small-scale storms that occur in the oceans of the high latitudes and are comparable to a tropical cyclone. The strong winds they produce are rightly feared by seamen. In the course of the last century, North Atlantic polar lows caused 56 shipwrecks with a total of 342 people lost at sea.Although polar lows do not always produce winds of hurricane force, they are particularly treacherous to shipping because they can develop very suddenly and, on account of their small diameter of only a few hundred kilometres, are very difficult to predict.Similarly, the lack of meteorological stations in the polar regions further compounds the difficulties of forecasting and documenting these weather systems.In order to determine whether the frequency of polar lows has increased in the North Atlantic in recent decades as a result of climate change, the environmental scientist Matthias Zahn and the climate researcher Hans von Storch from the GKSS Research Centre in Geesthacht examined global atmospheric data for the period from 1948 to 2006 in cooperation with the Meteorological Institute of the University of Hamburg.These data are available for areas of around 200 by 200 kilometres. âWhen youâre dealing with an essentially regional phenomenon such as a polar low, which often measures only a couple of hundred kilometres across, the resolution of global atmospheric data is too low to generate a precise analysis,â explains Matthias Zahn, who is currently working on his doctorate at the University of Hamburg.However, with the use of the so called âdynamical downscalingâ, Zahn has been able to give these global atmospheric data the resolution required for their application to an area of around 50 by 50 kilometres. At the same time, he has developed a mathematical method that makes it possible to detect polar lows in this higher-resolution data.âUsing this method, we were able to determine the frequency of polar lows during periods in the past, when satellite data was not as comprehensive as it is now. In the process, we discovered polar lows that donât appear in previous meteorological records,â says Zahn.The subsequent statistical analysis showed that there is no long-term trend in the frequency of polar lows over the last 60 years and that at present there is no direct correlation to global warming.The mathematical method developed by Zahn will continue to be used to generate statistical information on variable high wind speeds within polar lows and on this basis to develop scenarios elucidating the occurrence of such storms."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_545", "content": "Susan Cutter and Kevin Borden, from the University of South Carolina, Columbia, used nationwide data going back to 1970 to create their map. According to Cutter, \"This work will enable research and emergency management practitioners to examine hazard deaths through a geographic lens. Using this as a tool to identify areas with higher than average hazard deaths can justify allocation of resources to these areas with the goal of reducing loss of life\".Hazard mortality is most prominent in the South, where most people were killed by various severe weather hazards and tornadoes. Other areas of elevated risk are the northern Great Plains Region where heat and drought were the biggest killers and in the mountain west with winter weather and flooding deaths. The south central US is also a dangerous area, with floods and tornadoes posing the greatest threat.Heat/drought ranked highest among the hazard categories, causing 19.6% of total deaths, closely followed by severe summer weather (18.8%) and winter weather (18.1%). Geophysical events (such as earthquakes), wildfires, and hurricanes were responsible for less than 5% of total hazard deaths combined. Cutter said, \"What is noteworthy here is that over time, highly destructive, highly publicized, often catastrophic singular events such as hurricanes and earthquakes are responsible for relatively few deaths when compared to the more frequent, less catastrophic events such as heat waves and severe weather (summer or winter)\".The authors conclude, \"The spatial patterns revealed in our results may be unsurprising â greater risk of death along the hurricane coasts, in the interior west, and in the South â all areas prone to natural hazards as well as significant population growth and expansion throughout the study period. However, using this analysis as a blueprint for hazard mortality 'hot spots' supports justification for a more in-depth study of hazard- induced deaths in specific regions or communities. It is at this local scale where defining the deadliest hazard becomes important and emergency management officials can take action to try to reduce the number of future deaths\"."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_546", "content": "âIke reconfirmed the basic idea Iâve had for several years,â said Feagin, ecosystem scientist with Texas AgriLife Research. âThe plants on sand dunes and in marshes build an islandâs elevation, so we shouldnât compromise that.âMost of the dunes and marshes he and his graduate students had studied were destroyed or severely damaged by Hurricane Ike, which struck Galveston Sept. 13.But with the 2008 hurricane season officially over, Feagin has noted the changes and will begin again.His research over the years, however, has yielded discoveries that could help the tender ecosystem recover, depending on human interaction. Among his findings, when comparing before and after Ike, is that the marshes lost elevation, which is contrary to what most would expect to happen in a hurricane.Damage to Texasâs barrier islands stroke a variety of long-debated issues. According to the state's General Land Office, Texas is the only state in the nation that has an Open Beaches Act. That means the public has â free and unrestricted access to and use of the beachâ or the area between the dunes and the âstate-owned submerged lands,â the land office indicates.The stateâs coastline is more than 365 miles long. The width is measured from the vegetation line on the land to more than 10 miles into the Gulf of Mexico, according to the land office, which estimates a $7-billion-a-year tourism economy from the area.Thus, tension brews around mending hurricane-slashed coastal ecosystems from the standpoint of people who choose to live nearby and those who want to enjoy the stateâs property.Feagin, who admits a passion for coastal ecosystems, said four elements are impacted as a hurricane rolls over a barrier island: beaches erode, sand dunes âblow out,â houses and buildings are damaged and, finally, the marshes receive sediment deposits from all the above.âWith beaches, sand from the beach is washed out into the sea, and it usually comes back in the natural wave cycles over time,â he said. âBut along the Texas coast, our sand doesnât come back very well. Thatâs because it is very silty and so is carried farther away in the Gulf.â He said the stateâs coastline also has a lot of development and engineered structures such as jetties which are meant to stabilize the land but instead interrupt the natural sedimentary process.âThe coast is one of the most dynamic ecosystems there is, and it can totally change in a hurricane,â Feagin said.In some areas, he said, there was only a thin sand veneer on top of clay. With that sand now gone, all of the invertebrate animals are gone because they are not able to live in the clay.That will impact other animals in the food chain, such as birds that previously fed on the small creatures.Further inland come the sand dunes.âThe dunes are a little higher than the beach and some do OK,â he said. âBut basically water is forced through existing holes in dunes causing them blow out. Our dunes have problems because of over development, so that could make it difficult for sand dunes to re-establish.âFeagin said the sand dunes in the area hit by Hurricane Ike were already eroding at a rate of several feet per year. The natural mending of washed-out beaches might not be possible because of the many structures and non-native landscapes maintained there, blocking dune re-establishment.He explained that sand dunes need plants to accumulate sand from passing winds. Many of these plants are actually stimulated to grow as they become buried by sand, resulting in the deposit of another layer of sand until a larger, land-sustaining dune is \"born.\" But if a lawn is maintained where a dune used to be, the layers will never be allowed to rebuild and thus no dune will exist to provide some measure of protection in the future.âDunes can protect buildings to some degree in the smaller storms that are more common in the area,â Feagin said. âPlus the location of vegetation and dunes in Texas is where many legal battles play out for public versus private property issues.âWe care about dunes because we want our public beaches,â he added. âAnd if a private house has been built and there is now no dune in front of it, then that house is now on our public land and may block our access to this extremely valuable tourism resource. âBeyond these legal issues, he added, the dunes also support animals such as Kempâs Ridley sea turtles, which are endangered.The sea turtles' nesting season in Texas runs from April through mid-July but nesting peaks during May and June. Females typically nest at the base of dunes or within the dune complex, according to Dr. AndrÃ© Landry, AgriLife Research marine ecologist and director of the Sea Turtle and Fisheries Ecology Research Laboratory at Texas A&M University at Galveston.One of Feaginâs dune projects - planting of sea oats at Galveston State Park - was totally decimated by Ike. Sea oats, which used to be prevalent on the island, had been eliminated first from overstocking of cattle decades ago and then from building and infrastructure construction, said Feagin.In the next element of the island, certainly many homes and buildings were damaged, and plants there look âtoastedâ by salt water, he said.But the final section â the salt marshes â had measurable damage, as Feaginâs ecosystem research shows.âA salt marsh is normally a fairly nice protected area that benefits from a hurricane because all that sediment gets blown out from the beach, dunes and upland is deposited in the marsh,â Feagin said. âBut our research on the backside of Galveston where the surge was around 12 feet shows it lost elevation. The marshes need to maintain a fairly shallow water depth to support their unique ecosystem. And sea levels have been rising, so sediment is needed to maintain the depth.\"The sediment accumulation didnât happen. In fact, at our research site, elevation dropped at about same rate as under everyday conditions.âFeagin believes this could be because all the development between Gulf side and marsh side kept the sediment from arriving.âThere was not any sediment addition in the salt marsh, which is not good,â he said, noting that a lack of rain since Ike and the influx of a higher concentration of salt water means that many of the marshes are parched. âMarshes are among the most productive ecosystems in the world. They are full of organic materials, detritus algae and plants. Gulf crab, shrimp, and commercial fish all have some portion of their life in marshes. So if we lose marshes, we lose fisheries.âBird watching and hunting are also huge economically,â he noted, âand marshes also filter runoff from the mainland to provide cleaner water to the bays.âFeagin said the marshes also play a role in building new land because the plants slow down rising tide water, causing suspended sediment to settle, resulting in layers of land over time.\"Prior to Ike, we tested this near Galveston by killing the marsh plants in one area to compare surface elevation change with a nearby marsh where we left the plants alone,â he said. âWe found that the plants did help build land elevation prior to the hurricane.âHowever, when studying post-Ike surface erosion at the site, Feagin said, âwe found the plants did not prevent sediment erosion by waves during Ike and in fact enhanced erosion because their roots wiggled, stirring up sediment to be washed out to sea.âSome would say that plants directly protect the land and thus protect people from storms,â Feagin said. âBut thatâs not so in terms of the big storms. But the waves are not what does the damage and cause death, itâs the water depth. If you get a 12-foot wall of water, it doesnât matter if you have a front yard full of oak trees.âWe need to rely on âecological engineeringâ and good policy that requires people to build homes in the correct locations,â he said. âIf we covered a barrier island such as Galveston with concrete, you could say it was stabilized. But without the natural process of building elevation through by plants, the whole thing will eventually drown from the rising sea level.â"}

They attract more disaster relief, which makes them more corrupt.\"Leeson and Sobel base their conclusions on a statistical model that measured the relationship between FEMA allocations and corruption in each U.S. state. The researchers quantified corruption as the number of per capita convictions of public officials for crimes such as embezzlement, accepting bribes or kickbacks, extortion and unlawful dealings with private vendors or contractors.Hurricane-prone states like Florida, Mississippi and Louisiana, which receive large amounts of FEMA money, tend to have more corruption convictions per capita. States like Nebraska and Colorado, which receive almost no FEMA dollars, have least corruption.Leeson and Sobel also found notable spikes in corruption convictions in the year following influxes of FEMA money in a given area. For example, in 1997 Minnesota received around $300 million from FEMA after the Red River Flood. In 1998, corruption convictions in Minnesota spiked to 14 per 100,000 citizens from less than two per 100,000 the year before.The data used in the study were from 1990 to 1999, so the Katrina and Rita disasters of 2005 are not included. But Leeson and Sobel say the preliminary numbers indicate the aftermath of those disasters appears consistent with their finding. Federal prosecutors have thus far charged 700 individuals with crimes related to the nearly $33 billion FEMA allocated to deal with the disasters, they say."}

During the project, P-3 aircrews from Scientific Development Squadron ONE (VXS-1), the \"Warlocks\", Patuxent River, MD, and WC-130 aircrews from the 53rd Weather Reconnaissance Squadron \"Hurricane Hunters,\" Keesler Air Force Base, MS, worked with scientists from several universities and research organizations sponsored by the Office of Naval Research (ONR) and the National Science Foundation. Dr. Patrick Harr, a professor at the Naval Postgraduate School, Monterey, CA, is the lead scientist for the program.More than ten countries including scientists in the region from Japan, China, South Korea and Taiwan supported Tropical Cyclone Structure-2008, along with global partners such as Canada and the European Union because typhoons in the Pacific actually affect the ability to predict the weather across the entire Northern Hemisphere.The team of scientists used the NP-3 and WC-130 aircraft because of their unique capabilities. NRL's specialized, modified P-3 aircraft is capable of studying the outer part of the typhoon, focusing on the how and why of its changes in structure and intensity, while the Air Force WC-130 aircraft are capable of studying the inner core of the typhoon and penetrating the eyewall.The NRL NP-3, flying from Andersen Air Force Base, Guam, collected data using dropsondes, a unique Doppler wind lidar developed under Navy sponsorship, and the ELDORA radar, all of which were used to map the structure of the storm. The Air Force's WC-130s were fitted with a variety of equipment used for weather research. During flight, the aircraft measured numerous parameters including wind speed, wind direction, humidity, and temperature.One of the critical pieces of equipment on board the WC-130 aircraft is the dropsonde system. The GPS dropsonde system is equipped with a high frequency radio to pass measured conditions back to the aircraft and is released from flight level on a parachute about every 100 miles over water. With its dropsonde deployments, on-board sensors, and the Stepped Frequency Microwave Radiometer, the WC-130 provided observations of the typhoon intensity and inner wind structure from the formation stage to the extra-tropical transition stage. As the dropsonde descends to the sea surface, it measures and relays to the aircraft a vertical atmospheric profile of the temperature, humidity and barometric pressure and wind data.The researchers' goal is to learn more about how tropical cyclones form, intensify, and change through their life cycle and the impact they may later have across the North Pacific and Asia, North America and potentially Europe. The data collected during Tropical Cyclone Structure-2008 will validate the satellite-based techniques for intensity estimation in the Pacific. Prior to this time, this data had only been validated in the Atlantic where the WC-130s regularly fly such missions.In addition to NRL's NP-3 and the Air Force's WC-130 aircraft, the DOTSTAR, a Taiwanese  Astra business class jet, flew out of Taiwan and a Dassault Falcon 20E, another research-modified business class jet from DLR in Germany, flew from the U.S. Naval Air Facility Atsugi, Japan. Both aircraft deploy dropsondes and carry other equipment for meteorological studies.Along with the aircraft, scientists working from Hawaii launched high-altitude driftsondes. Driftsondes are zero-pressure balloons that go up to 80,000 feet. These balloons have a gondola that has small dropsondes the scientists release remotely by satellite. Tropical Cyclone Struture-2008 is the first research program to observe tropical cyclones from their formation near Guam to their transition into the midlatitudes near Japan. The scientists are hopeful that the data gathered during Tropical Cyclone Structure-2008 will help in understanding and predicting similar events in the Pacific and the Atlantic."}

One of the biggest problems during flooding emergencies is obtaining an overall view of the phenomenon, with a clear idea of the extent of the flooded area. Â The crisis image of the Cortes Department, one of the hardest hit areas, is comprised of two Envisat radar images â one acquired on 25 October and one on 20 September that was used as a reference. The blue and red colours indicate areas that are potentially flooded.The flooding is being compared to the devastation left by Hurricane Mitch, which killed about 6 000 people when it ripped through Honduras a decade ago. Overall, Mitch claimed more than 10 000 lives across Central America.In the wake of Hurricane Mitch, ESA, CNES and Spot Image worked to provide rapid and accurate EO-based maps of the area to emergency response teams. The reaction by the space community to the impact of Mitch is considered a precursor to the Charter.Today, the Charter has 10 members, including ESA, CNES, CSA, the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the Argentine Space Agency (CONAE), the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), the British National Space Centre/Disaster Monitoring Constellation (BNSC/DMC), the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and the China National Space Administration (CNSA)."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_552", "content": "The ongoing research could help coastal communities gauge the effectiveness of their sometimes controversial efforts to replenish eroding sand along shorelines while revealing the role storms play in building and eroding barrier islands such as Galveston.âThe big question is whether the sand was entirely removed from the system or if itâs still close enough to the shoreline to get back into the system,â said John Goff, survey team member and senior research scientist at the universityâs Jackson School of Geosciences.Goff and Mead Allison, another research scientist at the Jackson School, used the 60-foot research vessel R/V Acadiana to conduct a seafloor survey of the Bolivar Roads inlet just a week and a half after Hurricane Ike made landfall on the Texas coast. The inlet is the main passage between the Gulf of Mexico and Galveston Bay and is the route of the Houston Ship Channel as it passes between Galveston Island to the west and the Bolivar Peninsula to the east. The team used sonar to map the depth of the seafloor and seismic instruments to measure the thickness of sediments.The researchers knew the area well having led a group of university students on a marine geology and geophysics field class to Galveston this summer, collecting the most recent pre-Ike seafloor mapping and sample data from Bolivar Roads.âThe timing of our previous study was fortuitous,â said Goff, âadding to the practical and public benefit of our post-Ike data.âHurricane Ikeâs surge last Sept. 13 filled Galveston Bay with 12 feet of water, which subsequently drained back into the ocean as a âback surge.â Although considerable amounts of water flowed over the Bolivar Peninsula and other lower-lying portions of the barrier system, most of the surge and back surge likely passed through Bolivar Roads, by far the deepest access between the Gulf and the Bay. The very high rate of flow that must have passed through the inlet had the potential to cause substantial erosion and transport sediment long distances.Comparing pre- and post-Ike surveys, the scientists determined the hurricaneâs surge and back surge significantly modified the seabed over broad areas. Ike either erased or substantially degraded large shell-gravel ridges up to 10 feet high. The storm gouged out sediments deposited hundreds of thousands of years ago to create âerosional pitsâ up to five feet deep in one area. It appears to have mobilized and redeposited sediments over large regions in a layer eight to 40 inches thick, and in isolated spots up to 6.5 feet thick. Most of the movement of sediments is associated with the back surge.In conducting their post-Ike survey, the scientists are primarily interested in investigating the impact of the storm surges on the movement of sediment into and out of the beach barrier system. Maintenance of a barrier system requires an influx of sand, provided naturally by rivers such as the Mississippi. Human modifications to rivers by dams or levees disrupt the delivery of sand to the shore, which can cause the barrier system to degrade.Until now, the transport of sediments during large storms was a poorly known quantity. Surges could potentially boost the barrier island sand budget by delivering sediments to the shore face, or they could subtract from it by moving sand too far off shore to be incorporated into the barrier system. The pre- and post-Ike survey work will also identify any storm-affected changes to the inlet channel that could affect navigation.Weather permitting, the team will conduct an additional survey Nov. 6-8 offshore of Bolivar Roads to identify the extent of storm-related deposition, and offshore of the Bolivar Peninsula, where aerial and satellite photos suggest significant amounts of surface erosion during the back surge and consequential deposition off shore. Jackson School researcher Sean Gulick will also participate in this extended effort.Funding for the survey was provided by the Jackson Schoolâs Rapid Response Program, which funds field research requiring immediate action, in advance of the months it often takes to receive federal or non-profit grant money. Such projects include research into the effects of natural disasters like sinkholes, hurricanes, earthquakes and tsunamis."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_553", "content": "The study explores the relationship between sea surface temperature (SST) and seasonal hurricane activity, and show how differing interpretations of the observational record can imply vastly different futures for Atlantic hurricane activity due to global warming.  The two interpretations arise from assumptions of whether it is the local SST in the Atlantic in isolation, or whether it is the SST in the Atlantic 'relative' to the rest of the tropics, that drives variations in Atlantic hurricane activity.If one assumes the former (the local SST hypothesis), then by 2100, the lower bound on Atlantic hurricane activity is comparable to that of 2005, when four major hurricanes struck the continental United States, causing more than $100 billion in damage. The upper bound exceeds 2005 levels by more than a factor of two. However, if one assumes the latter (the relative SST hypothesis), then the future is similar to the recent past, with periods of higher and lower hurricane activity relative to present-day conditions due to natural climate variability, but with little long-term trend.The statistical relationship between either interpretation of the SST/hurricane activity link is ambiguous over the period 1946-2007 (they are statistically indistinguishable, though both are significant), but they imply fundamentally different projections for the future and interpretations of the past. The team further argues that the consistency between theory, numerical models, and historical observations offers compelling evidence that the 'relative' SST hypothesis is more accurate and provides a better framework for projections of future changes in hurricane activity."}

Satellites can collect images of areas affected by a natural disaster, but there are dissemination restrictions and cloud cover can prevent collection of images.\"Without a real-time map, it's very hard to do population estimates and demographic estimates to figure out where people are, how they're moving, how they're spaced out and even how many people you have on the ground,\" said Benjamin Sklaver, a project officer from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) International Emergency and Refugee Health Branch. \"This technology does not exist currently, so GTRI's imaging system is really an innovative project.\"The imaging system was developed with funding from the CDC, and agency officials would like to begin using this device as soon as possible. After responding to the recent devastation caused by Hurricanes Hanna and Ike, the CDC asked GTRI to accelerate delivery of the imaging device for use during the 2008 hurricane season.\"We plan to package the system for use on Coast Guard UH-60J Black Hawk helicopters, which were among the first to fly over Haiti following Hanna's devastation,\" said David Price, a GTRI senior research technologist.The imaging system â designed by Price and senior research engineer Gary Gray â is called the \"Mini ModPOD,\" which stands for \"Miniature Modular Photographic Observation Device.\" It consists of an off-the-shelf Canon Digital Rebel XTi digital camera, a global positioning system receiver, a small circuit board that uploads mission parameters, and an inertial measurement unit that measures the aircraft's rate of acceleration and changes in rotational attributes, including pitch, roll and yaw. The images collected from the system can be stitched together to create a complete picture of the affected area.The research team has tested the device on several flights, selecting areas with large populations of people likely to be outdoors.\"During the first test flight, we wanted to test the clarity and resolution of the images collected during the run, and we were very pleased,\" said Price. \"We could see tennis balls on the ground and people reading books at outdoor tables. This was sufficient detail to allow accurate counting the number of people in an area.\"After the first flight, the researchers reduced the weight of the device and developed a more accurate geo-referencing capability, which allowed the physical location of the scenes shown in each photograph to be determined with precision. With the modifications made, the researchers went for a second flight test in July.The research group selected a rectangular zone of interest and loaded the latitude and longitude coordinates of the zone into the system from a USB drive. As soon as the helicopter flew into the zone, the camera began snapping pictures. The electronics were set to measure the speed of the aircraft so that each photo overlapped 60 percent of the preceding photo, making it easier to stitch together the photos to create a complete picture. The pilot made two passes, at altitudes of 500 and 1,000 feet above ground level.\"This test flight was successful in confirming the Mini ModPOD's ability to activate the camera within the zone of interest. The resulting photos were extremely sharp and clear â they were free of any vibration or motion effects,\" added Price.The photos were successfully matched to the flight data, which enabled the CDC to adjust them for geospatial reference. However, due to a software glitch, they were not overlapped as planned. The researchers made a small adjustment to the software and completed a third a third test flight in August.\"This flight resulted in images that were 60 percent overlapped, enabling CDC engineers to build a high-resolution mosaic image,\" noted Price. \"Individuals on the ground were easily distinguishable as people separate from other objects.\"The imaging system will also be available to the CDC and other agencies, such as the American Red Cross, to count people in refugee camps in order to plan for health and humanitarian services."}

Known as  bagasse, this waste residue is attractive to Formosan termites.After the dikes  were breached in 2005, Henderson and his colleague Alan Morgan inspected 100  seams for evidence of termites, including three areas where major breaks in the  walls had occurred. 70% of the seams in the London Avenue Canal, which  experienced two major breaks during Katrina, showed evidence of insect attack,  as did 27% of seams inspected in the walls of the 17th Street Canal.The Formosan  subterranean termite originates from China, where it has been known to damage  levees since the 1950s. Besides eating at bagasse seams, the termites may have  contributed to the destruction of the levees of New Orleans by digging networks  of tunnels, which can cause âpiping,â sending water through the tunnels and  undermining the levee system.âI believe that  the termites pose a continuing danger that requires immediate attention,â  Henderson writes. âThe fact that termites cause piping in levees must be  accepted.âThe author  further suggests that New Orleansâ 350 miles of levees and floodwalls should be  surveyed for termite damage, and that treatment of the floodwalls and nearby  trees may be necessary to avoid future disasters. Henderson will demonstrate one  survey method using ground-penetrating radar at the ESA Annual Meeting in Reno,  Nevada, November 16-19."}

For example, the CCSP report concluded that future changes in frequency were uncertain, and that rainfall and intensity were likely to increase, but with unknown consequences.Improved understanding of climate change and hurricanes is an especially high priority for the energy industry, which has a concentration of drilling platforms, refineries, pipelines and other infrastructure in the region that are vulnerable to severe weather.Hurricanes Gustav and Ike damaged offshore oil production and several refineries, disrupting gasoline supplies.The project is part of a larger effort examining regional climate change between 1995 and 2055.The simulations are being run on NCAR's bluefire supercomputer with support from NSF, NCAR's sponsor, and through a long-term collaboration with the insurance industry through the Willis Research Network.\"This research program by NCAR is a major contribution to the insurance industry and public policy makers,\" says Rowan Douglas, managing director of Willis.\"The primary way to improve our understanding of present and future hurricane risk is to generate computer simulations of storms in unprecedented detail.\"For the project, the model will examine three decades in detail: 1995-2005, 2020-2030, and 2045-2055. Scientists will use statistical techniques to fill in the gaps between these decades.A major goal is to examine how several decades of greenhouse-gas buildup could affect regional climate and, in turn, influence hurricanes and other critical weather features. Scientists will also investigate the impact of the powerful storms on global climate.One of the most difficult technical challenges for such a project is to create a model that can capture both the climate of the entire world and the behavior of a single hurricane.To get around this roadblock, NCAR has developed an approach called Nested Regional Climate Modeling (NRCM). The center \"nests\" a special version of its high-resolution weather model (the Weather Research and Forecasting model, or WRF) inside its lower-resolution, global climate model (the Community Climate System Model, or CCSM).The resulting simulations show fine-scale detail for certain regions, like the Gulf of Mexico, while also incorporating global climate patterns.For each of its decade-long time slices, the NRCM's resolution will be about 20 miles across Africa, Europe, and the South Atlantic, 7.5 miles across the tropical Atlantic and northeastern United States, and an even sharper 2.5 miles over the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico, southeastern United States, and drought-prone western United States.\"Combining weather and climate models in this way enables more detailed projections of hurricanes in a warming world than any study to date,\" says Holland. \"These projections will help reduce the uncertainty of current assessments, and they also serve the very important role of providing experience about applying future predictions of changes to high impact weather systems in general.\""}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_557", "content": "The genesis of the EWS effort began in 2007 when Dr. Harold J. Raveche, President of Stevens, was attending a meeting in the DR during which the topic of vast hurricane devastation came up. Dr. Raveche offered his help and asked Dr. Alan Blumberg, Director of Stevens' Center for Maritime Systems, and Dr. Thomas O. Herrington, also of the Center, to see how Stevens could offer assistance. They began collaborative efforts with Janet Kunhardt at Stevens Institute of Technology International (SITI), and together they established important relationships with leaders and engineers in the DR to establish the program.Blumberg received more assistance for promoting the EWS project when Eileen Parra, a Stevens Civil Engineering student and a native of the DR, joined the team. Parra moved to the US from the DR when she was six-years old. She always had a love for math and her uncle, a civil engineer in the DR, inspired her to study civil engineering. During the summer of 2007, her uncle gave her an opportunity for hands-on experience doing management work for the construction of Aurora del Sol Hotel in Santo Domingo, DR.Since moving to the US, Parra has returned to visit her country every summer and always looked for ways to give back. She feels that working with the EWS is the opportunity she's been waiting for. After familiarizing herself with the EWS project goals, she submitted a proposal to Stevens' Technogenesis program to further the work in the DR. The proposal was accepted and Parra traveled to the DR to continue project development from June through August 2008.\"Hurricanes have always been a concern in the DR,\" explained Parra, \"but since the hurricanes in October and November of 2007, which took place during hurricane off-season, DR wanted to improve the method of monitoring hurricanes at all times.\" Stevens' assistance with improved technology and equipment will increase DR's ability to detect hurricanes on time, even during hurricane off-season and all year long. As accuracy in detecting hurricanes improves, so will the efficiency of transmitting the message to DR natives who live in both urban and rural areas. As a result, there will be increased prevention against hurricanes and flooding for the whole island.Creating a more technological EWS will also increase employment opportunities in the DR and provide greater educational opportunities for engineers who will be involved with the EWS. Stevens plans to train Dominican engineers in the modeling and rehabilitation of the improved EWS and work jointly with them during the installation process. A mirror site to DR's EWS, which will be located at Stevens' Davidson Laboratory, will help oversee the work being done and serve as a back-up EWS if the DR's system gets destroyed in a disaster.\"The people in the DR are very anxious and enthusiastic about this project and are impressed by what we can offer,\" said Parra, \"They believe it's possible and they want to start right away. They are also very honest and open to receiving help.\"A proposal for technical advancement funding for the program was recently submitted by Stevens to the United Nations Development Fund (UNDP) and a proposal will soon be submitted to USAID. \"If this program is successful in the DR, it can be taken to other Caribbean countries,\" said Blumberg.Five years from now, Parra hopes to see the new EWS in the DR up and running. She predicts it will take about one year to receive funding for the project, two years for installation of the software and equipment and a few more years to achieve a good record of storm prediction."}

Key findings of the FAU report were included just this week by Florida Gov. Charlie Crist's Climate and Energy Action Team when it adopted the \"Adaptation\" section of its final report.\"The impacts of climate change on Florida's coasts and on our economy will be substantial, persistent and long-term, even under our conservative estimates,\" said Julie Harrington, director of the Center for Economic Forecasting and Analysis at FSU. \"Should, as many models predict, sea level rise, and hurricane strength and other factors become more extreme, much greater economic impacts will occur along many parts of Florida's coast in this century.\"The second new study, by researchers at FAU, focused on state adaptation policies needed as Florida faces the impacts of climate change.\"The goal of our study is to help the state of Florida adapt, in the most effective way possible, to climate change impacts that are now inevitable,\" said Jim Murley, director of Florida Atlantic University's Center for Urban and Environmental Solutions and leader of the study. \"These approaches must be comprehensive and strategic, not piecemeal and episodic. Governor Crist and other leaders have rightly identified adapting to climate change as one of the state's greatest challenges -- we look forward to working with the state to protect our people, natural splendor, and economic livelihood. There is real work to be done.\"This research was supported by a grant from the National Commission on Energy Policy, a project of the Bipartisan Policy Center.This study uses current estimates of sea level rise from Florida State University's Beaches and Shores Resource Center and 2001 estimates from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to evaluate the effect of sea level rise on the six coastal counties. The results show projected trends in storm-surge flood return periods associated with hurricanes, damage costs associated with flooding from major storm events, and the value and area of land at risk.Under the FSU study's estimates for sea level in Dade County, the value of land at risk totals $6.7 billion in 2080 (in 2005 dollars). (By comparison, using International Panel on Climate Change sea level estimates, the value of land at risk in Dade County ranges from $1 billion to $12.3 billion in 2080). The study also calculated the effect of storm surge and sea level rise on future damage costs, finding that if a storm like Hurricane Wilma from 2005 occurred in 2080, the cost to Dade alone would be from 12 percent to 31 percent higher (in 2005 constant dollars). While these findings do not account for adaptive strategies or potential future increases in property values, they still provide valuable information about potential impacts and resources that are put at risk from sea level rise.Key findings of the report have been included by Gov. Crist's Climate and Energy Action Team as it adopted the \"Adaptation\" section of its final report this week in Tallahassee. Important findings from the FAU study call for major state environmental, growth management and public infrastructure decision-making processes to be adjusted so they are responsive to future climate change impacts.\"FAU will continue to research how Florida can be a leader in providing guidance to other states on how best to put in place workable solutions that will help communities adapt to future climate change impacts,\" Murley said.\"Storm events associated with certain levels of storm surge could increase in frequency in the future, due to sea level rise,\" Harrington said.\"As sea level rises, damage costs associated with extreme storm events increases significantly for the Florida counties examined in this study,\" she said."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_559", "content": "As hurricanes have pounded the Gulf of Mexico this fall, the media has been filled with the words of politicians, policy makers, NGOs and local communities touting the importance of ongoing wetlands restoration projects as long-term storm protection for coastal communities and infrastructure. Unfortunately, thereâs little science to support this growing belief.âI think thatâs a potentially dangerous messageâ said Robert Young, director of the Program for the Study of Developed Shorelines at WCU. âWhile I think that wetland restoration is a worthy goal, thereâs almost no scientific evidence that suggests that we will be able to put the wetlands back on the scale and nature needed to reduce storm impacts.âYoung is scheduled to present recommendations from a recent white paper, co-authored by 26 leading coastal scientists and engineers, on Tuesday, 7 October, at the 2008 Joint Meeting of the Geological Society of America (GSA), Soil Science Society of America (SSSA), American Society of Agronomy (ASA), Crop Science Society of America (CSSA), and Gulf Coast Association of Geological Societies, this week in Houston, Texas, USA.*As a hurricane moves toward land, onshore winds push water in front of the storm and cause water levels to rise as the storm makes landfall. This storm surge can range from several to 30-plus feet and, along with the waves that accompany the storm, inflict the greatest damage to infrastructure, Young said.Wetlands can dampen the effect of storm surge, the problem is that scientists donât fully understand the impact that adding wetlands might have. âIn order to predict the impact of wetlands on storm surge, you need to have good storm surge data to understand what happened in the past. But we simply donât have that data,â Young said. âItâs one of the gaping holes that we have in understanding whatâs going on at the coast.âThe problem is that storm surge is hard to measure. âYou canât just go out there and stand with a stick and measure a 30-foot storm surge.â Thereâs also a tremendous amount of variability in storm surge height along the shore, variability that isnât reflected in current storm impact models.Scientists can measure storm meteorology â wind speeds and directions, rainfall and such â but until they can measure the ground effects of storm surge, including how far inland the waves are penetrating, âweâll never be able to say much of anything about storm impact, and we certainly wonât be able to calibrate, verify and check the veracity of the models being used.âAs a result, the models are flying blind, Young said. Add to this the fact that land loss is happening at such a rate in the Gulf, due to subsidence of the Delta and exacerbated by rising sea levels, that Young fears that the billion-dollar restoration programs planned for the region will do little to maintain the status quo, let alone repair previous damage.âIâm afraid that over the long term this is a losing battle,â Young said. âIf the government of the State of Louisiana wants to do its citizens the best service, it needs to begin to understand how it will relocate some of these communities.â*On October 7, the abstract, paper 6-6: âRestoring Coastal Louisiana Will Not Guarantee the Protection of Infrastructure from Storms: Policy Makers Should Also Plan for Strategic Relocation of Critical Infrastructure and Vulnerable Communitiesâ will be presented at the Joint Meeting."}

The center of Ike's eye passed nearly directly over the DOW, allowing scientists to take measurements of the front and rear eyewalls, and of the inside of the eye.Deployed with the DOW were two vehicles equipped with instruments to track winds and raindrop size distributions, and ten unmanned \"pods,\" which measured winds at locations so close to the water that human observers could not safely remain in the vicinity.The vehicles were deployed at raised locations near the ends of the Galveston Causeway.The pods stood watch in lines on the end of the Galveston Sea Wall and the Texas City Sea Wall, with 500-meter-spacing so the passage of small-scale gusts could be measured.The DOW observed several mesovortices--swirling winds--in Ike's eyewall, which intensified winds and rainfall as these mesovortices rotated around the eye.\"The mesovortices are likely associated with some of the worst localized wind damage caused by Ike,\" said Wurman.\"The understanding from the DOW project is essential to improving forecasts of hurricane intensity, path, and rainfall amounts,\" he said. \"It will lead to new insights on the nature of near surface winds in hurricanes, the behavior of hurricane eyewalls and processes inside eyewalls, and processes in hurricane rainbands.\""}

Earth observation (EO) satellites are key means of providing synoptic data on the forces that power the storm, such as cloud structure, wind and wave fields, sea surface temperature and sea surface height.Thanks to Envisatâs unique capability to acquire optical and radar imagery over the same area of the Earth simultaneously, the top and bottom of a hurricane can be viewed at the same time. The unique view of Hurricane Ike on the left is an example of combined optical and radar images, showing the swirling cloud-tops and the shape of the wind-driven sea surface. Â Moreover, satellite-based radar instruments have the capability of penetrating heavy clouds and precipitations and can provide day and night high-resolution observations of critical ocean parameters, such as local wind, waves and currents over a 400-km-wide region.Using these capabilities specific to radar satellites, Dr Bertrand Chapron of IFREMER, the French Research Institute for Exploitation of the Sea, and Dr Fabrice Collard of France's CLS radar application division in Brest, have developed sets of algorithms that allow data from the Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ASAR) instrument aboard Envisat to be processed in Near-Real Time (NRT) and to produce state-of-the-art ocean parameters.Taking advantage of the broad availability of Envisat ASAR wide swath acquisitions taken over the hurricane region, the corresponding sea surface roughness map, wind speed map and surface current are made widely available on the SOPRANO ocean products demonstration website developed with ESA.\"The knowledge of hurricane eye details, the radius of very high winds, details on the swell fields, and the new information on atmosphere feedback to ocean surface velocity will certainly help coupled ocean-atmosphere models to better predict hurricane track and intensity,\" Dr Chapron said.As clearly revealed for Hurricane Ike, wind speeds around the hurricaneâs eye can far exceed 40m/s (about 80 knots).The sea surface roughness map clearly shows a minimum in the well-delineated eye where the conditions are relatively calm. Around the eye of the storm, the sea surface velocities also capture the circular direction of the prevailing wind and waves, as visible in this image over Great Inagua Island in the Bahamas on 7 September.This analysis of the residual Doppler from the radar echoes allows for the retrieval of radial velocities which are used to provide systematically and in Near Real Time a map of the radial component of sea surface velocity.The colour of the graphics shown in the âcurrentâ section is representative of a very strong eastward motion in the southern part of the hurricane and a symmetrical strong westward motion in the northern part. These observations are clearly in line with the hurricane winds turning counter clockwise.In the future, these combined instantaneous wind speed, wave heights and surface velocity maps will be integrated into models to improve storm track and intensity forecasts.\"Sentinel-1, the follow on to Envisatâs SAR mission, will have an improved instrument capability with dual polarisation and higher imaging resolution, and will benefit from this demonstration to achieve better winds accuracy in extreme conditions,\" Dr Collard said."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_564", "content": "Why is September the peak month for hurricanes? NASA oceanographer, Bill Patzert at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif., provided the answer: \"Hurricanes are fueled by warm ocean temperatures and September is the end of the Northern Hemisphere ocean warming season. The 2008 Atlantic hurricane season started early with the formation of Tropical Storm Arthur on May 30, from the remnants of the eastern Pacific Ocean's first storm, Alma, which crossed Central America and reformed in the Gulf of Mexico. It took one month and four days for the next storm to form, Bertha. Now, the action is definitely picking up. The tropical Atlantic is warm, but not unusually so. In the tropical Atlantic, Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico, temperatures are certainly well above the 80 degree Fahrenheit threshold, so conditions are ripe for generating and sustaining major tropical storms and hurricanes.\"Once a powerful Category 3 hurricane, now a tropical depression, Gustav moved from northwest Louisiana into northeastern Texas and into Arkansas by Sept. 3. Like Tropical Storm Fay in August, Gustav's legacy will lie in large rainfall totals. According to the National Hurricane Center's discussion on Sept. 2, \"Storm total rainfalls are expected to be five to ten Inches with isolated maximums of 15 inches over portions of Louisiana, Arkansas and Mississippi. Rainfall amounts of 4-8 inches have been already reported in parts of Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana.\"Meanwhile, Tropical Storm Hanna formed near the Leeward Islands from the eighth tropical depression. Observed by the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite to contain a deep and intense thunderstorm tower on Sept. 1 (often a precursor to intensification), it subsequently strengthened briefly into a hurricane before weakening under the influence of vertical wind shear (winds that can weaken or tear a tropical cyclone apart). On Sept. 3 and 4 Hanna was pounding the Bahamas with heavy rains and tropical storm force winds, according to the National Hurricane Center.The ninth tropical depression of the year formed some 1,200 miles east of the Leeward Islands and has blown up into Tropical Storm Ike. On Sept. 4, Ike strengthened into a major hurricane, Category 4 on the Saffir-Simpson Scale, with maximum sustained winds near 145 mph. Ike is forecast to head west and may also affect the Bahamas.Behind Ike, on Sept. 2, the tenth tropical depression in the Atlantic Ocean basin was born. Tropical Depression 10 formed west of the African coast, so it has a long way to go before it has any impact on the U.S. or the Caribbean. By the late morning, that tropical cyclone became Tropical Storm Josephine.In August, Fay's ten-day romp from the U.S. Southeast northward up the Appalachian Mountains seemed like a harbinger for September's storms. Fay took her time going northward and dumped tremendous amounts of rain along the way. Melbourne Beach, Fla., received as much as 25.28 inches of rain. Other cities in various states reported high totals: Thomasville, Ga., reported 17.43 inches; Camden, Ala., received 6.85 inches; Beaufort, S.C., received 6.11 inches; Carthage, Tenn., reported 5.30 inches, and Charlotte, N.C., reported 5.90 inches. Fay was a perfect example of how weaker tropical storms can cause flooding inland.\"Our findings [in a recent journal article] indicate that weak tropical systems could significantly contribute to rainfall totals,â said Marshall Shepherd, lead author of a NASA-funded study that appeared in a December 2007 issue of the American Geophysical Unionâs Geophysical Research Letters. \"These types of storms are significant rain producers. The larger hurricanes arenât frequent enough to produce most of the actual rain during the season and therefore are not the primary storm type that relieves drought in the region.\"Conditions in the Atlantic this year are favorable for an active season because of warm sea surface temperatures and low wind shear (winds that tear a tropical cyclone apart). \"Although La Nina conditions in the equatorial Pacific Ocean have subsided, the atmospheric jet stream over North American and the North Atlantic are still retaining some characteristics of the faded La Nina,\" Patzert said. \"The upper atmospheric winds that could shear the tops off tropical storms are staying north, allowing tropical storms to develop and grow into hurricanes.\"Compared to the long-term historical record, the first half of the 2008 hurricane season has been busier than usual. According to meteorologist Scott Braun at NASAâs Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Md.: âLooking back to 1995 and earlier, most seasons have had only 5-7 storms by Sept. 2, whereas this year has had 10. 2008 is surpassed only by 1995 (13), 2003 (11), and 2005 (14) and matched by 2004 (10). Prior to 1995, the last time there were 10 storms by Sept. 2 was 1936 (11).âAs Gustav has shown, a powerful, land-falling storm can impact millions of people and do billions of dollars of damage. As we approach the mid-September peak in hurricane activity, hurricane experts are on high alert and the residents of the Caribbean Islands, Central America, and the American Gulf and East coasts should be prepared for additional hurricane activity."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_565", "content": "Gustav formed on 25 August 2008 some 400 km southeast of Port-au-Prince, Haiti (seen above far right image), when a tropical wave developed curved bands and an upper level eye feature (visible), causing the U.S. National Hurricane Center to designate it Tropical Depression Seven.Later that day, it had gained enough strength to be designated Tropical Storm Gustav. By the following morning, Gustav had strengthened into a hurricane with winds reaching 150 km per hour.Hurricane Gustav weakened as it moved over Haitiâs mountainous landscape and was downgraded to a tropical storm. The storm moved toward Jamaica (as visible in the 28 August acquisition) and picked up strength. By 29 August, it was again upgraded to a hurricane.As it neared the west end of Cuba on 30 August (visible), Gustav was upgraded to a Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale with sustained winds near 195 km per hour.By 31 August Hurricane Gustav had entered the Gulf of Mexico with maximum sustained winds of more than 210 km per hour and made landfall in Louisiana on 1 September (visible) as a Category 2 hurricane with winds close to 177 km an hour.Hurricanes are large powerful storms that rotate around a central area of extreme low pressure. They arise in warm tropical waters that transfer their heat to the air. The warmed air rises rapidly, in the process creating low pressure at the water surface. Winds begin rushing inwards and upwards around this low-pressure zone.Instruments aboard ESAâs Envisat allow it to observe various features of hurricanes, including high atmosphere cloud structure and pressure, wind pattern and currents at sea surface level and oceanic warm features that contribute to the intensification of hurricanes."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_566", "content": "Using global satellite data, FSU geography Professor James B. Elsner, University of Wisconsin-Madison Professor James P. Kossin and FSU postdoctoral researcher Thomas H. Jagger found that the strongest tropical cyclones are, in fact, getting stronger -- and that ocean temperatures play a role in driving this trend. This is consistent with the \"heat-engine\" theory of cyclone intensity.\"As seas warm, the ocean has more energy that can be converted to tropical cyclone wind,\" Elsner said. \"Our results do not prove the heat-engine theory. We just show that the data are quite consistent with it.\"Kerry Emanuel of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology first suggested the possible connection between global warming and increases in tropical cyclone intensity in a 2005 paper. He linked the increased intensity of storms to the heating of the oceans, which has been attributed to global warming.Critics argued that the data were not reliable enough to make assertions about the relationship between climate change and hurricanes. Moreover, when scientists looked at the mean tropical cyclone statistics, they did not see an upward trend.Elsner's team addressed both issues by using globally consistent, satellite-derived tropical cyclone wind speeds as opposed to the observational record and by focusing on the highest wind speeds of the strongest tropical cyclones each year.Emanuel's theory is that the intake of warm air near the ocean surface and the exhaust of colder air above the cyclone is what drives a hurricane. Other factors being equal, the warmer the ocean, the warmer the intake of air. This heat-engine theory of how hurricanes increase their intensity is well accepted, but there are many environmental factors, such as wind shear, that might prevent a hurricane from strengthening, Elsner said.To address that problem, Elsner's team looked at a subset of hurricanes that are closest to their maximum possible intensity (MPI). Under the heat-engine theory, every storm will lose some energy through inefficiency, and that loss will limit the storm's potential. The MPI represents the storm's maximum potential under ideal environmental conditions.\"We speculated that you might not see a trend in the intensity of typical hurricanes due to environmental factors, but if the heat-engine theory is correct, you should see a trend in the intensity of hurricanes at or near their MPI,\" Elsner said. \"On average, the strongest storms are closest to their MPI.\"The researchers created a data set from satellite observations of hurricane intensity of all tropical cyclones around the globe and looked at the maximum wind speeds for each one during a 25-year period. Tropical cyclones, which include hurricanes, typhoons and tropical storms, occur on average about 90 times per year worldwide.The researchers found that the strongest tropical cyclones are getting stronger, particularly over the North Atlantic and Indian oceans. Wind speeds for the strongest tropical storms increased from an average of 140 mph in 1981 to 156 mph in 2006, while the ocean temperature, averaged globally over the all regions where tropical cyclones form, increased from 28.2 degrees Celsius to 28.5 degrees Celsius during this period.\"By creating a better, more consistent historical data set, we've been able to weed out quality issues that introduce a lot of uncertainty,\" Kossin said. \"Then, by looking only at the strongest tropical cyclones, where the relationship between storms and climate is most pronounced, we are able to observe the increasing trends in storm intensity that both the theory and models say should be there.\"While Elsner said the heat-engine theory might explain how tropical cyclones intensify given that everything else is the same, he noted, \"We still do not have a complete understanding of why some cyclones intensify, sometimes quite rapidly, and others don't.\"The research is supported by the National Science Foundation and the Risk Prediction Initiative of the Bermuda Institute for Ocean Studies."}

The BRFSS is the worldâs largest, on-going telephone health survey system and has been tracking health conditions and risk behaviors in the United States every year since 1984.âKey findings of the survey include:âSome of the findings did surprise usâ says Professor Kim. âBeing unemployed and having missing family members were not correlated with poor mental health, but they did correlate with poor physical health.âAlso, difficult access to clean drinking water did not correlate with poor physical health, but it did correlate with poor mental health.âThe aims of the study were to assess the medium-term post-Katrina mental and physical health of New Orleans residents and to determine the demographic, social and environmental factors that predict these problems.The 222 residents were interviewed by University nursing students and faculty members, in partnership with the non-profit organisation Heart to Heart International. They were carried out during door-to-door visits and a community health fair in December 2006, 15 months after Katrina.Just under two-thirds of the respondents (64 per cent) were aged between 35 and 64 years of age and 47 per cent had some college education. Sixty per cent were female, 77 per cent were black and 47 per cent were unemployed.More than a quarter had no healthcare insurance, ate less than they should because of lack of money, lived below the poverty line and said their current house was unsafe due to major damage. Almost a quarter (23 per cent) felt unsafe from crime.âOur findings indicate that the Katrina survivors are likely to suffer from persistent poor mental and physical health for the foreseeable future unless concerted interventions are put in placeâ says Professor Kim.âThe study suggests that post-Katrina efforts should focus on protecting the residents from crime, improving mental health services to those who are depressed and improving food supplies to the poor.âWe also hope that our findings will provide valuable guidance for healthcare professionals and policy makers involved in future disasters, by helping them to anticipate and deal with the mental and physical health problems that are left behind once the initial crisis has been dealt with.\""}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_568", "content": "\"In laboratory experiments over the last decade, whites have tended to have negative reactions including negative emotions and attitudes towards minorities when racism was blamed for or cited as the reason for something.  When Katrina happened it offered an opportunity to look at a real world problem that came into our living rooms and the belief system, or world view, that everyone has,\" said Cheryl Kaiser, a University of Washington assistant professor of psychology and lead author of a new study.The study is noteworthy because, unlike previous research that looked at claims of discrimination, whites did not express outright negativity toward blacks.  Instead it indicated that whites who were exposed to racial discrimination claims displayed strong positive attitudes toward whites rather than negative attitudes at blacks.Blacks tended to have less favorable attitudes toward whites after seeing the race-blame video than the government-incompetence video, but the difference was not significant.  Blacks also showed strong positive attitudes toward blacks in both scenarios.For the study Kaiser and her colleagues from Syracuse and Michigan State universities recruited 93 white and 60 black undergraduate college students. The majority in each group were women.Each participant viewed the video presentation individually on a computer monitor equipped with headphones.  All of the students watched a five-minute clip taken from a National Geographic program about the hurricane.  Then the video content was divided into two experimental conditions.In a race-blame condition, half the participants viewed a six-minute series of segments in which Katrina victims, public figures and journalists claimed that the government had responded slowly to the disaster because the majority of victims were black.  The other participants saw a six-minute government-incompetence series of clips in which victims, public figures and journalists said government incompetence caused the ineffective disaster response.  Then all of the participants viewed a three-minute slide show, consisting of 96 photographs, showing the physical damage and physical suffering caused by the hurricane.After the video presentation, each participant filled out questionnaires that assessed their attachment to their own racial group and their attitudes toward blacks, whites and a number of filler groups such as teachers and politicians. In addition, they were asked to provide an explanation for the disaster response they recalled being made most often in the video they saw.Kaiser said that media coverage that focused on racial explanations for the aftermath of Katrina did affect white Americans' attitudes and could have potentially important consequences for intergroup relations.\"Our sense is some white Americans couldn't understand the claims of racism and it was hard for them to think skin color was responsible for people surviving the hurricane and getting relief.  This study helps us understand why discrimination claims make a large number of people in the U.S. uncomfortable.  These claims act as a threat to the perceived fairness of our system and people who are at the top, generally white, want to maintain the status quo,\" she said.The paper, published in the current issue of the journal Social Justice Research, was funded by grants from the National Science Foundation.

{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_570", "content": "Michael Metzger's software tool, created as part of the research for his PhD dissertation, could allow emergency managers to better decide early on whether and when to order evacuations â and, crucially, to do so more efficiently by clearing out people in stages. The tool could also help planners optimize the location of relief supplies before a hurricane hits.By analyzing data from 50 years of hurricanes and detailed information on several major ones, and by comparing the information available at various times as a hurricane approached with data from the actual storm's passage, Metzger said he was able to produce software that provides a scientifically consistent framework to plan for an oncoming hurricane. His approach uses the best available hurricane track models developed over the years, but even these can be wrong half of the time â a degree of uncertainty that further complicates the job for local emergency managers.Because many of these managers have never had to confront the life-or-death realities of an approaching hurricane, they need a consistent analytical framework to consider the sequence of complex decisions that they need to make. For example, a poorly planned evacuation could cause roadway gridlock and trap evacuees in their cars â leaving them exposed to the dangers of inland flooding. As another example, ordering too many precautionary evacuations could lead to complacency among local residents, who might then ignore the one evacuation advisory that really matters.\"All in all, this is a complex balancing act,\" Metzger says.The concept of evacuating an area in stages â focusing on different categories of people rather than different geographical locations â is one of the major innovations to come out of Metzger's work, since congestion on evacuation routes has been a significant problem in some cases, such as hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Metzger suggests that, for example, the elderly might be evacuated first, followed by tourists, families with children, and then the remaining population. The determination of the specific categories and their sequence could be determined based on the demographics of the particular area.By spacing out the evacuation of different groups over a period of about two days, he says, the process would be more efficient, while many traditional systems of evacuating a given location all at once can and have caused serious congestion problems. With his system, officials would get the information needed to \"pull the trigger earlier, and phase the evacuation,\" he says, and thus potentially save many lives. Coincidentally, during the recent hurricane Fay in Florida, a modest version of a selective evacuation was implemented successfully when tourists were asked to leave while residents remained in place.Other factors that could help to make evacuations more effective, he says, include better planning in the preparation of places for evacuees to go to, making sure buses and other transportation are ready to transport people, and preparing supplies in advance at those locations.Metzger, who is a research assistant in the MIT Engineering Systems Division's Center for Engineering Systems Fundamentals, and a PhD student in the Operations Research Center, received a second-place award out of more than 100 entries from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security earlier this year for the work. He has already discussed his conclusions with federal and state emergency officials, who said they are interested in adopting the new methodology. The hope is that they will initially use it side by side with their existing procedures, in order to track exactly how the results would compare, Metzger says. It is possible that his methods, implemented as a visually appealing computer program, could be used as a \"cockpit training tool\" for local emergency managers.His adviser Richard Larson, Mitsui Professor of Engineering Systems and of Civil and Environmental Engineering, says Metzger's approach \"embodies elements of engineering, management and the social sciences.\" For example, while much of the work was strictly mathematical in the analysis of decision-making strategies, there was also a strong component of sociology involved in evaluating people's responses to false-alarm evacuations.Metzger has discussed the work with officials in South Africa, and also received an award from the National Science Foundation's graduate student conference. He plans to refine the software further over the course of the next year or so."}

{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_572", "content": "Factors known to influence the number and intensity of hurricanes in a season, including El NiÃ±o, sea surface temperatures, wind, and sea level pressure, led to NOAA forecasts for an above-average 2007 hurricane season. However, the season, which runs from June through November, turned up six hurricanes â a near normal number, but less than the 10 expected and far fewer than the record-breaking 15 hurricanes in 2005.The difference between the 2007 and 2005 seasons could be due in part to the westward reach of Saharan dry air and dust over the North Atlantic, according to researchers, including Bill Lau of NASA's Goddard Spaceflight Center in Greenbelt, Md., and co-author of a study on this finding published Aug. 14 in the American Geophysical Union's Geophysical Research Letters. The study also confirms the possible role of Saharan dust in shattering predictions for the 2006 hurricane season, and has implications for more accurate predictions for future hurricane seasons.Lau and colleagues previously reported that the presence of dust could have contributed to a weaker 2006 hurricane season than forecasters expected. Dust over the North Atlantic blocked some sunlight from reaching the ocean, accounting for 30 to 40 percent of the drop in sea surface temperatures measured between June 2005 and June 2006. The cooler sea surface increases atmospheric stability and also reduces the transfer of heat from ocean to atmosphere â a major source of fuel that drives hurricanes.Now, the team found that hurricane formation in 2007 was also hampered by Saharan dry air. They go further, however, to describe the extent to which the dry air and associated dust spread across the tropical North Atlantic, as seen by instruments aboard NASA satellites such as the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer. They created a \"wind-stretch index,\" based on the east-west difference in wind speed over the tropical Atlantic. The index is connected to relative humidity over the tropical western Atlantic, and is a perfect measure of how far west dry air and dust from Africa extends over the North Atlantic.The team found that instances of Saharan dry air and dust extending far west over the Caribbean were in sync with conditions that contributed to fewer hurricanes in both 2007 and 2006, including lower sea surface temperatures. They also found that the far-reaching western extent of dust in 2006 and 2007 was associated with less-than-normal humidity over the western North Atlantic.\"This index hasn't been looked at before,\" said Lau. \"We introduce a way to relate wind stretch to dry air and dust, which correlate very well with humidity in the western tropical Atlantic.\"The link between dust and humidity, the researchers say, could aid future forecasts. As dust outbreaks occur most often in early summer prior to peak hurricane season, researchers could use a measure of humidity in the western tropical Atlantic to gauge the extent of dust transport, possibly providing an additional parameter to estimate the following month's hurricane activity.\"The index we proposed may provide practical implications for the prediction of Atlantic hurricane activities,\" says Donglian Sun of George Mason University in Fairfax Va., and lead author of the study. \"Further studies are needed to discern the general prediction capability of our results.\"If the index is on target, the team believes it could also describe dust's role in past hurricane seasons. Records of historical wind data from ground stations could be applied to the index to infer the westward extent of dry air and dust long before satellites existed to \"see\" dust from above."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_573", "content": "While current thinking about changes in hurricane frequency comes mostly from computer simulations of global climate, the computer models used for these studies can only represent the coarsest features of hurricanes, thus casting doubt in their predictions of hurricane activity.The new approach by Nolan and Rappin, developed in collaboration with Dr. Kerry Emanuel of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, uses computer models with much more accurate representation of the processes that lead to hurricane formation, much the same way a digital image with more pixels allows for a more detailed photographic image.The models are used to simulate the rate of hurricane development in tropical atmospheres with varying values of sea surface temperature and vertical wind shear (which is the extent to which wind speed and direction changes with height in the atmosphere). These two variables â ocean temperature and wind shear -- are considered to be the two most important factors in predicting hurricane activity, both in operational forecasting and in consideration of climate change.\"We designed the computer simulations to show that as the ocean temperature increased, hurricanes would form more rapidly and easily, even in the presence of wind shear,\" says Nolan, associate professor of Meteorology at the Rosenstiel School. \"Instead, we got exactly the opposite result. As the water temperature increased, the effectiveness of the wind shear in suppressing hurricane formation actually became greater.\"The simulations show that if they do form, hurricanes become stronger in the warmer environments. Together, these results suggest that in a global warming world, there would be less hurricanes, but those that do form could become stronger. The same prediction has recently been made by other studies using global climate models, and the similarity of the two predictions enhances confidence in the results.\"The additional aspect that our method offers is a much more accurate picture of the process of tropical storm and hurricane formation, as compared to the global models,\" Nolan said. \"Our ongoing work with this model and others should lead to a much better understanding of the relationship between climate and global hurricane activity.\""}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_574", "content": "NOAA now projects an 85 percent probability of an above-normal season â up from 65 percent in May. The updated outlook includes a 67 percent chance of 14 to 18 named storms, of which seven to 10 are expected to become hurricanes, including three to six major hurricanes of Category 3 strength or higher on the Saffir-Simpson Scale. These ranges encompass the entire season, which ends November 30, and include the five storms that have formed thus far.In May, the outlook called for 12 to 16 named storms, including six to nine hurricanes and two to five major hurricanes. An average Atlantic hurricane season has 11 named storms, including six hurricanes and two major hurricanes.âLeading indicators for an above-normal season during 2008 include the continuing multi-decadal signal â atmospheric and oceanic conditions that have spawned increased hurricane activity since 1995 â and the lingering effects of La NiÃ±a,â said Gerry Bell, Ph.D., lead seasonal hurricane forecaster at NOAAâs Climate Prediction Center. âSome of these conditions include reduced wind shear, weaker trade winds, an active West African monsoon system, the winds coming off of Africa and warmer-than-average water in the Atlantic Ocean.âAnother indicator favoring an above-normal hurricane season is a very active July, the third most active since 1886. Even so, there is still a 10 percent chance of a near normal season and a five percent chance of a below normal season.NOAAâs hurricane outlook is a general guide to the expected level of hurricane activity for the entire season. NOAA does not make seasonal landfall predictions since hurricane landfalls are largely determined by the weather patterns in place as a hurricane approaches.Five named storms have formed already this season. Tropical Storm Arthur affected the Yucatan Peninsula in late May and early June. Bertha was a major hurricane and the longest-lived July storm (July 3-20) on record. Tropical Storm Cristobal skirted the North Carolina coastline. Dolly made landfall as a Category 2 hurricane at South Padre Island, Texas on July 25. And on August 5, Tropical Storm Edouard struck the upper Texas coast.âIt is critical that everyone know the risk for your area, and have a plan to protect yourself, your family and your property, or to evacuate if requested by local emergency managers. Be prepared throughout the remainder of the hurricane season,â Bell said. âEven people who live inland should be prepared for severe weather and flooding from a tropical storm or a hurricane.âThe Atlantic hurricane season includes activity over the Atlantic Ocean, Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico. The peak months of the season are August through October."}

Colle and colleagues tested their combined model against Tropical Storm Floyd and a nor'easter from 11-12 December 1992, and found the model predicted peak water levels comparable (within 10 percent) to those measured during the storms at several water level gauges around the region.\"Ultimately, the goal is to provide emergency managers with a range of possibilities as to what may happen as the result of a storm, and this approach shows great promise,\" says Dr. Colle.The modelers also performed simulations to assess the impact of parameters such as local tide level and wind intensity on flooding severity.  Model simulations showed that if Tropical Storm Floyd had arrived in NYC a week earlier, coinciding with a spring (fortnightly) high tide, water levels would likely have been high enough for minor flooding to occur. Another simulation, which used wind levels of a Category 1 hurricane timed to arrive at spring high tide, predicted water levels likely to have caused significant flooding. These results suggest that the New York City metropolitan region was spared from flooding during Tropical Storm Floyd only because the storm's winds had weakened before reaching the region and because the strongest winds luckily occurred during local low tide.\"We're playing Russian roulette in some sense with these storms coming up the coast,\" says Colle. \"If we have a high tide or spring high tide when we have one of these events, then we're in trouble.\"If a category-3 hurricane hit NYC, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers estimates that nearly 30% of the south side of Manhattan would be flooded. Storm surge flooding could threaten billions of dollars of property and have a grave impact on the lives of the millions of people who live in NYC. During the December 1992 nor'easter, storm tides over-topped some of the region's seawalls for only a few hours, but managed to flood the NYC subway and the PATH train systems at the train station in Hoboken New Jersey, shutting down these transportation systems for several days.As sea level rises, NYC becomes even more vulnerable to storm surge flooding. It takes high water levels of only 1.5- 1.75 m (4.92 â 5.74 feet) above mean sea level to cause flooding over some of the southern Manhattan Island seawalls and global warming is expected to increase the rate at which sea level rises from 0.3 m (0.98 feet) per century to 0.5- .75 m (1.64 â 2.46 feet) per century.\"The vulnerability of the area speaks for itself as we've already had cases of flooding,\" says Colle. \"When coupled with sea level rise, it's not going to take much of a storm to cause flooding as we go into the coming decades, so we are working to provide better forecasting of these events in the future.\""}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_576", "content": "The survey of 5,055 people was conducted in eight states--Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina and Texas--and only included residents of high-risk counties, those within 20 miles of the coast. The poll also included a special sample of the New Orleans metropolitan area.The top concern of respondents who were not affected by Katrina is that they would have problems getting gas needed to evacuate (39% very worried). This is a concern that Katrina-affected respondents share (36% very worried) but rank below worries about fresh water and medical care. Those not affected by Katrina are much less likely to be worried about fresh water (27% very worried) and getting needed medical care (29% very worried).\"The top concerns of people in high-risk hurricane areas--having enough fresh water, getting medical care, and obtaining gas to evacuate--are all things that public officials can plan for before the major storms of this season hit,\" said Robert J. Blendon, Professor of Health Policy and Political Analysis at the Harvard School of Public Health.Katrina-affected respondents have a heightened degree of concern across a number of issues compared to those not affected by the storm. These concerns include caring for a chronically ill or elderly household member, having enough cash on hand during the storm's aftermath, dealing with the conditions at an evacuation shelter if they should need to go to one, and being threatened by violence. Approximately one in three Katrina-affected respondents are very worried about each of these problems while those who were not affected by Katrina are less worried.These findings are based on interviews conducted May 27 -- June 23, 2008 with 5,055 adults in high hurricane risk counties in eight states. Twelve percent of the survey's respondents said they were threatened or hit by Hurricane Katrina while 46% were threatened or hit by a different hurricane during the past five years.The results of this survey will be distributed to state and local officials for use in emergency planning.Despite the destruction caused by Hurricane Katrina, a sizeable number of people living in high-risk hurricane areas say they would not evacuate due to a major storm if government officials said they had to leave. Nearly one in four (23%) Katrina-affected respondents and 28% of other high risk area respondents would stay in their homes. Of those respondents who would need help to evacuate (20% of Katrina-affected respondents and 18% of others), nearly half (46% Katrina-affected and 49% other high-risk respondents) have not arranged that help. Approximately one in four pet owners (25% Katrina-affected and 27% other high-risk respondents) do not have a place they could go and take their pet.Compared to other respondents, those coping with a chronic illness or disability in the household are less prepared for a major hurricane and are more worried about a number of storm related problems. The survey found that 14% of residents of high-risk hurricane areas live in households in which someone has a chronic illness or disability that would require them to get help in order to evacuate. Of this group, 43% do not have help lined up. Seventeen percent are not prepared at all for a major hurricane in the next six months compared to 9% of others. They are also less likely to have a three week supply of the prescription drugs they take (39% compared to 30% of others) and have a first aid kit (30% compared to 20%).Evacuation shelters could also be faced with the challenges of supporting people with chronic illnesses and disabilities. If they get the help they need to evacuate, respondents living in households in which someone has a chronic illness/disability are more likely to go to a shelter (22% compared to 10% of others). The unique needs of families with a chronic illness/disability are evident in their storm-related concerns. They are more likely to be very worried about getting needed medical care (50% compared to 28%), suffering from heat exhaustion (45% compared to 23%), having enough fresh water to drink (41% compared to 27%), and having necessary prescription drugs (41% compared to 19%).\"This study shows that if nothing is done, thousands of people with chronic illnesses and disabilities could be stuck in their homes during a major hurricane,\" said Professor Blendon. \"Preparing now for evacuating these groups could prevent future tragedies.\"Despite the increased risk to mobile home residents during a hurricane, 17% say they would not evacuate in the event of a major storm if officials told them to do so. Nearly one in four (23%) think their home could survive a category 3 or higher hurricane. When asked how prepared they would be if a major hurricane were to strike their community in the next six months, 17% of mobile home residents said they are not prepared at all.This survey part of a series of studies by the Harvard School of Public Health Project on the Public and Biological Security. The study was designed and analyzed by researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health (HSPH). The project director is Robert J. Blendon of the Harvard School of Public Health. The research team also includes Tami Buhr, John M. Benson, and Kathleen J. Weldon of the Harvard School of Public Health, and Melissa J. Herrmann of ICR/International Communications Research. Fieldwork was conducted via telephone for the Project by ICR/International Communications Research of Media (PA) between May 27 and June 23, 2008.The survey was conducted with a representative sample of 5,055 non-institutionalized adults ages 18 and over in high hurricane risk counties in eight states. Survey participants included residents of all counties within 20 miles of the coast in Alabama (500 interviews), Florida (1,007), Georgia (502), Louisiana (1,002), Mississippi (500), North Carolina (506), South Carolina (500), and Texas (538). The survey included 502 residents of the New Orleans metropolitan area, where interviews were conducted with adults from cellphone-only households, as well from households with landline telephones.The results were weighted to represent the total adult population in the high hurricane risk counties of the region as a whole. The margin of error for the total sample is plus or minus 2.8 percentage points.Possible sources of nonsampling error include nonresponse bias, as well as question wording and ordering effects. Nonresponse in telephone surveys produces some known biases in survey-derived estimates because participation tends to vary for different subgroups of the population. To compensate for these known biases, sample data are weighted to the most recent Census data available from the Current Population Survey for gender, age, race, education, as well as number of adults in the household. Other techniques, including random-digit dialing, replicate subsamples, callbacks staggered over times of day and days of the week, and systematic respondent selection within households, are used to ensure that the sample is representative.The Harvard School of Public Health Project on the Public and Biological Security is funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention through a grant to the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials (ASTHO). HSPH provides ASTHO and the CDC with technical assistance for public health communication by monitoring the response of the general public to public health threats."}

The increased coverage will help researchers improve current models for practical use in predicting hurricane intensity, while providing valuable data that can be used to improve tsunami warning models.\"When it comes to predicting hurricane intensity, the curve in the last 40 years has been somewhat flat, with little advance in how to reduce error in predicted intensity,\" said Gustavo Goni, of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in Miami. Maps of sea surface height created from satellites, however, could help change the curve.Satellites that measure sea surface height have been running operationally nonstop since November 1992. But more than one is needed to fly at the same time in order to identify all the features that could be responsible for intensification of tropical cyclones all over Earth. The OSTM/Jason 2 mission will help make the additional coverage possible.NASA, university and NOAA investigators, including Goni, work to transform sea surface height information obtained from satellites, such as OSTM/Jason 2, into maps of ocean heat content. Forecasters can use the maps to develop models to predict how hurricanes will strengthen.Determining heat content from sea surface height is possible because warm water is less dense and hence sits higher than cooler water. In some regions, such as inside and outside the Gulf Stream current, the temperature differences result in more than a one-meter (three-foot) difference in sea surface height. Goni and colleagues use this established concept to estimate from sea level variations how much heat is stored in the upper ocean in areas where hurricanes typically develop and intensify.While sea surface height may not necessarily be the most significant parameter for hurricane intensity forecasts, researchers now know that if sea surface height is accounted for in current forecast models, errors in forecasts for the most intense storms are reduced. For weak storms, the reduction in error is not very significant. However, for storms in the strongest category 5 range, the heat content in the upper ocean derived from sea surface height becomes increasingly important. \"This is a good thing, because these are the storms that produce the most damage,\" Goni said.\"OSTM/Jason 2 will help us to keep the necessary coverage that we need to identify ocean features that can be linked to tropical cyclone intensification, because with only one satellite we may miss some of them,\" Goni said.Upper ocean heat content derived from sea surface height is now used in operational and experimental forecast models in all seven ocean basins where tropical cyclones exist.In December 2004, two satellites happened to be in the right place at the right time, capturing the first space-based look at a major tsunami in the open ocean. Within two hours of a magnitude 9 earthquake in the Indian Ocean southwest of Sumatra, the Jason 1 and Topex/Poseidon satellites fortuitously passed over the path of the resulting tsunami as it traveled across the ocean. It measured the leading wave, traveling hundreds of miles per hour in the open ocean, at about 0.5 meters (1.6 feet) tall.Wave height measurements like those of the Indian Ocean tsunami do not provide an early warning because the information is not relayed to ground stations in real time. That's the job of early warning systems operated by NOAA and other global organizations that currently employ a network of open-ocean buoys and coastal tide gauges. Sea surface height measurements of tsunamis can, however, help scientists test and improve ground-based models used for early warning. One such system developed at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), Pasadena, Calif., and undergoing tests at NOAA's Pacific Tsunami Warning Center, Ewa Beach, Hawaii, could become operational within about three years.Most tsunamis are caused by undersea earthquakes. Using the JPL-developed system, when seismometers first identify and locate a large earthquake, scientists can use GPS measurements to search around the earthquake's source to see if land has shifted, potentially spurring a tsunami. Scientists can then immediately compile the earthquake's size, location, and land movement into a computer program that generates a model tsunami to determine the risk of a dangerous wave. After the wave passes, scientists can search through wave height data from satellites and verify what the model predicted.\"Satellite data play the crucial role of verifying tsunami models by testing real tsunami events,\" said JPL research scientist Tony Song. \"If an earthquake generates a tsunami, does the satellite data match observations on the ground and model predictions?\"\"One of the unique pieces of satellite observations is the large-scale perspective,\" said JPL research scientist Philip Callahan. Tsunamis can have waves more than 161 kilometers (100 miles) long. Such a wave would likely go unnoticed by an observer in a boat on the ocean's surface. But satellite altimeters like OSTM/Jason 2 can see this very long wave and measure its height to an accuracy of about 2.5 centimeters (one inch).Scientists' ability to test tsunami warning models will be aided by OSTM/Jason 2. With the Topex/Poseidon mission now ended, the currently orbiting Jason 1 has now been joined by and will eventually be replaced by OSTM/Jason 2. This will help ensure that future tsunamis will also be observed by satellites as well as by buoys and tide gauges.\"The biggest value in satellite measurements of sea surface height is not in direct warning capability, but in improving models so when an earthquake is detected, you can make reliable predictions and reduce damage to property and people,\" Callahan said.For more information on OSTM/Jason 2, visit: For more information on JPL's climate change research programs, visit:"}

The answer is diverse power input. You integrate different types of local power sources with diverse energy delivery infrastructures through multiple-input converter modules.\"Since the communications industry power standard is direct current (DC) local networks, Kwasinski is exploring DC generation systems using a microgrid-based telecom power plant with a modular distributed architecture. Energy would come from a mixture of renewable energy sources, microturbines, fuel cells, and interconnection to the existing utility grid. Converters in secondary distribution frames would isolate short circuit currents. Since the utility grid is a secondary source, the microgrid would be protected against the grid's surges and failures.The savings would be generous. Microgrids could \"sell\" excess power to the utility grid. Costs decrease because of reduced energy storage, less down time, equipment operating at maximum efficiency, lower hardware expense, and optimal power input control based on energy costs.\"I think the most exciting aspect of the research is how flexible this approach is,\" says Kwasinski. \"It works for developing countries who can add components to the system as they can afford it. Existing systems can easily be retrofitted with a microgrid system operating as a secondary distribution method. Small devices like solar panels and windmills can be added ad hoc, making for a painless transition to renewable energy at a competitive cost.\""}

Gable roofs are common only because they are cheaper to build. Research and testing show that a 30-degree roof slope has the best results, she said.Wind forces on a roof tend to be uplift. \"This explains why roofs blow off during extreme wind events,\" she said.  To combat uplift, she advises connecting roofs to walls with nails, not staples. Stapled roofs were banned in Florida after Hurricane Andrew.Aim for strong connections between the structure and foundation. Structural failure is often progressive where the failure of one structural element triggers the failure of another. Connections can be inexpensively strengthened.Roof overhangs are subject to wind uplift forces which could trigger a roof failure. In the design of the hurricane-resistant home, the length of these overhangs should be limited to about 20 inches.The design of the researched cyclonic home includes simple systems to reduce the local wind stresses at the roof's lower edges such as a notched frieze or a horizontal grid. Install the latter at the level of the gutters along the homes' perimeter.An elevated structure on an open foundation reduces the risk of damage from flooding and storm-driven water.Taher also teaches some courses to help prepare architecture graduates for the Architect Registration Exam.

{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_580", "content": "The new equation, developed by University of Michigan atmospheric and planetary scientist Nilton Renno, could allow scientists to more accurately calculate the maximum expected intensity of a spiraling storm based on the depth of the troposphere and the temperature and humidity of the air in the storm's path. The troposphere is the lowest layer of Earth's atmosphere.This equation improves upon current methods, Renno says, because it takes into account the energy feeding the storm system and the full measure of friction slowing it down. Current thermodynamic models make assumptions about these variables, rather than include actual quantities.\"This model allows us to relate changes in storms' intensity to environmental conditions,\" Renno said. \"It shows us that climate change could lead to increases in how efficient convective vortices are and how much energy they transform into wind. Fueled by warmer and moister air, there will be stronger and deeper storms in the future that reach higher into the atmosphere.\"Renno and research scientist Natalia Andronova used the model to quantify how intense they expect storms to get based on current climate predictions. For every 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit that the Earth's surface temperature warms, the intensity of storms could increase by at least a few percent, the scientists say. For an intense storm, that could translate into a 10 percent increase in destructive power.Renno's model is what scientists call a \"generalization\" of Daniel Bernoulli's 18th-century equation that explains how airplane flight is possible. Bernoulli's equation basically says that as wind speed increases, air pressure decreases. It leaves out variables that were considered difficult to deal with such as friction and energy sources (which, in the case of a whirling storm, is warm air and condensation of water vapor.) And in certain idealized situations, omitting that information works fine.But by including these additional variables, Renno was able to broaden Bernoulli's equation to apply it to more general phenomena such as atmospheric vortices.\"The laws of physics are generally very simple,\" Renno said. \"When you make assumptions, you are not representing the simple, basic law anymore. If you don't make assumptions, your equations have those simple, basic laws in them. It gets a little more complicated to get to the solution, but you don't introduce error, and you answer is more elegant, more simple.\"Renno's work bolsters studies by others who say hurricanes have grown stronger over the past 50 years as sea surface temperatures have risen. This effect has not been extreme enough for humans to notice without looking, scientists say. Hurricane Katrina and Cyclone Nargis were not the most intense storm to hit land in the past half century. Other factors contributed to the devastation they caused.This new model helps explain the formation of spiral bands and wall clouds, the first clouds that descend during a tornado. It's clear now that they are the result of a pressure drop where the airspeed has increased.Renno says unifying convective vortices from dust devils to cyclones will help scientists better understand them.\"This is the first thermodynamic model that unifies all these vortices,\" he said. \"When you unify them, you can see the big picture and you can really understand what makes them form and change.\"A co-investigator on NASA's Mars Phoenix Lander mission, Renno has used his new model to calculate the intensity of dust storms in Mars' polar regions. He found that at the Phoenix landing site dust storms can have winds in excess of 200 mph.Renno is an associate professor in the Department of Atmospheric, Oceanic and Space Sciences. Andronova is a research scientist in the Department of Atmospheric, Oceanic and Space Sciences."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_581", "content": "Ali Tokay, a research scientist from the Joint Center for Earth Systems Technology (JCET) at the University of Maryland Baltimore County, Baltimore, and NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Md., compared the rain measurements collected in tropical storms and hurricanes during the past three Atlantic hurricane seasons with measurements after these storms transitioned to being extra-tropical. Tokay's study appeared in the May issue of the American Meteorological Society's Monthly Weather Review.When a tropical cyclone -- the generic name for tropical depressions, tropical storms and hurricanes -- merges with a mid-latitude frontal storm system, measurable changes to the raindrop size and abundance occur as the system transitions to become extra-tropical. Extra-tropical cyclones also form outside the tropics without being part of a tropical system, and tend to form over land rather than over the open ocean. This category of storm can produce anything from a cloudy sky to a thunderstorm as it develops between weather fronts, the boundaries separating air masses of different densities.Tokay looked at raindrop size, rain intensity, and the area in which rain falls in both tropical cyclones and extra-tropical cyclones using ground-based rain-measuring instruments called disdrometers. These instruments measure the range of raindrop sizes in a storm and the intensity of the rainfall. The disdrometer is an important part of the ground-based rain measuring instruments that are used to validate rainfall seen from satellites including the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM), a joint mission with NASA and the Japanese Space Agency. He concluded that tropical cyclones that form over water tend to rain harder and have a greater amount of smaller drops before they transition to being extra-tropical with raindrops of larger size and mass.\"Torrents of rainfall from tropical storms are not surprising since the systems are large and move slowly. It is also true that slow moving frontal systems associated with an extra-tropical cyclone can result in abundant rainfall at a site,\" said Tokay. \"What is less known is that the distribution of raindrops within a volume of air between the two systems differs substantially even though weather radar may measure the same returned power which is known as reflectivity.\" This is why disdrometer measurements of raindrop size are needed.\"Both rain intensity and reflectivity are integral products of raindrop size distribution, but they are mathematically related to different powers of the drop size,\" said Tokay. Weather radars cannot measure the range of raindrop sizes. As a result, rainfall estimates from weather radars must employ the use of equations that make assumptions about raindrop size. These assumptions can result in underestimation of rain intensity, and the possibility of deadly flooding.In the study, Tokay uses disdrometer data from various sites around the U.S. and abroad. Most of the data were collected at NASA's Wallops Flight Facility, Wallops Island, Va., where Paul Bashor of Computer Sciences Corporation, Wallops Island, Va. maintains several types of disdrometers. The data from two tropical storms were collected at Orlando, Fla., and Lafayette, La. through collaborative efforts with Takis Kasparis at the University of Central Florida's Orlando campus, and Emad Habib of the University of Louisiana at Lafayette."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_582", "content": "âLiving in a coastal state means having a plan for each and every hurricane season. Review or complete emergency plans now - before a storm threatens,â said retired Navy Vice Adm. Conrad C. Lautenbacher, Ph.D., undersecretary of commerce for oceans and atmosphere and NOAA administrator. âPlanning and preparation is the key to storm survival and recovery.âThe Climate   Prediction Center  outlook calls for considerable activity with a 65 percent probability of an above normal season and a 25 percent probability of a near normal season. This means there is a 90 percent chance of a near or above normal season.The climate patterns expected during this yearâs hurricane season have in past seasons produced a wide range of activity and have been associated with both near-normal and above-normal seasons. For 2008, the outlook indicates a 60 to 70 percent chance of 12 to 16 named storms, including 6 to 9 hurricanes and 2 to 5 major hurricanes (Category 3, 4 or 5 on the Saffir-Simpson Scale).An average season has 11 named storms, including six  hurricanes for which two reach major status.âThe outlook is a general guide to the overall seasonal hurricane activity,â Lautenbacher said. âIt does not predict whether, where or when any of these storms may hit land. That is the job of the National Hurricane Center after a storm forms.âÂ Bill Read, director of NOAAâs National Hurricane  Center, said, âOur forecasters are ready to track any tropical cyclone, from a depression to a hurricane, which forms in the Atlantic Basin. We urge coastal residents to have a hurricane plan in place before the season begins and NHC will continue to provide the best possible forecast to the public.âWhen a storm forms in the tropics â and even before that stage â NOAA forecasters at the Miami-based National Hurricane Center are in continuous monitoring mode â employing a dense network of satellites, land- and ocean-based sensors and aircraft reconnaissance missions operated by NOAA and its partners. This array of data supplies the information for complex computer modeling and human expertise that serves the basis for the hurricane centerâs track and intensity forecasts that extend out five days in advance.The science behind the outlook is rooted in the analysis and prediction of current and future global climate patterns as compared to previous seasons with similar conditions.âThe main factors influencing this yearâs seasonal outlook are the continuing multi-decadal signal (the combination of ocean and atmospheric conditions that have spawned increased hurricane activity since 1995), and the anticipated lingering effects of La NiÃ±a,â said Gerry Bell, Ph.D., lead seasonal hurricane forecaster at NOAAâs Climate Prediction Center. âOne of the expected oceanic conditions is a continuation since 1995 of warmer-than-normal temperatures in the eastern tropical Atlantic.ââAmericans in hurricane-prone states must get serious and be prepared.Â  Government â even with the federal, tribal, state and local governments working perfectly in sync â is not the entire answer.Â Everyone is part of the emergency management process,\" said FEMA Administrator R. David Paulison.Â \"We must continue to develop a culture of preparedness in America in which every American takes personal responsibility for his or her own emergency preparedness.âNOAAâs Atlantic hurricane season outlook will be updated on August 7, just prior to what is historically the peak period for hurricane activity.Tropical systems acquire a name â the first of which for 2008 will be Arthur â upon reaching tropical storm strength with sustained winds of at least 39 mph. Tropical storms become hurricanes when winds reach 74 mph, and become major hurricanes when winds reach 111 mph.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, an agency of the U.S. Commerce Department, is dedicated to enhancing economic security and national safety through the prediction and research of weather and climate-related events and information service delivery for transportation, and by providing environmental stewardship of our nation's coastal and marine resources.

{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_583", "content": "\"This study adds more support to the consensus finding of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and other reports that it is likely that hurricanes will gradually become more intense as the climate continues to warm,\" said Tom Knutson, research meteorologist and lead author of the report. \"It's a bit of a mixed picture in the Atlantic, because we're projecting fewer hurricanes overall.âÂ The findings are reported in a study by scientists at NOAA's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory in Princeton, N.J., scheduled to be published online on May 18 in Nature Geoscience. Knutsonâs co-authors are Joseph Sirutis, Stephen Garner,  Gabriel Vecchi, and Isaac Held.The scientists performed hurricane simulations using a new regional model that offers both higher resolution and an improved ability to simulate past observed changes in Atlantic hurricane activity. In a preliminary study published last October in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society, the new model was shown to successfully reproduce Atlantic hurricane counts year-by-year from 1980 to 2006, including the observed increasing trend.In the new study, the model was used to test the influence of greenhouse gas warming on Atlantic hurricane activity through the end of the 21st century. Simulations reveal higher levels of wind shear and other changes, which act to reduce the overall number of hurricanes in the model.Tropical Atlantic sea surface temperatures have increased over the past century and several studies have reported strong correlations between increasing tropical Atlantic sea surface temperatures and measures of hurricane activity since at least 1950. Although it is widely accepted in the climate change research community that increases in greenhouse gases have caused most of the global warming of the last half century, the link between increasing greenhouse gases and hurricane activity has been a topic of wide debate and of little consensus.This new study suggests that in the Atlantic basin, global warming from increasing greenhouse gases will have little impact, or perhaps cause some decrease, in tropical storm and hurricane numbers.âWe'll need to keep an eye on upcoming model studies to see how robust the projected increase in wind shear over the Atlantic turns out to be,â said Knutson.Â Large-scale environmental changes in circulation, such as wind shear, as well as possibly moisture, are likely the dominant factors producing the reduced storm frequency. These results support recent research showing that the primary driver of the recent increase in Atlantic hurricane numbers was the warming of the tropical Atlantic relative to the other tropical basins.These results are also consistent with a number of previous modeling and theoretical studies that have examined the influence of global warming from increasing greenhouse gases on hurricane intensity. An increase in hurricane intensities globally is assessed as \"likely\" in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment Report issued in 2007.Â"}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_584", "content": "âIncreasing evidence now shows that storms are becoming more intense due to climate change,â said lead author and Earthwatch scientist Dr. James Crabbe from the University of Bedfordshire in the United Kingdom.Coral reefsâwhich can grow to be thousands of years oldâform and grow when free-swimming coral larvae in the ocean attach to rocks or other hard surfaces and begin to develop. Intense storms can wipe out this ârecruitmentâ process.âStorms threaten the survival of the entire reef itself,â said Crabbe, who found similar results in another Earthwatch-supported study in Jamaica a few years ago. The new study will appear in the May issue of Marine Environmental Research.âIf the storms donât destroy corals outright, they render them more susceptible to disease, and that is certainly apparent on the Belize reefs,â said Crabbe, who is doing a lecture tour related to this work throughout 2008âdeemed the International Year of the Reef by the International Coral Reef Initiative (ICRI).The study holds implications for marine park managers, Crabbe said. âThey may need to assist coral recruitment and settlement [in hurricane years] by establishing coral nurseries and then placing the baby corals (larvae) in the reef at discrete locationsâ or by setting up artificial reef blocks to help the corals survive.Crabbe conducted the research in 2006 and 2007 with Edwin Martinez, Earthwatch Field Director in Belize and co-author, as well as with the help of young local scientists. Earthwatch, the worldâs largest environmental volunteer organization, has conducted a coral research program in Belize for the last three years.The team measured the size of more than 520 non-branching corals in two major coral reef areas in southern Belize: the Sapodilla Cayes Marine Reserve, a world heritage site in the second largest barrier reef in the world, and the Port Honduras Marine Reserve. In addition to providing habitat for an array of marine life, non-branching massive coralsârobust and shaped like mounds, and sometimes called âbrain coralsââbuffer coastal zones from erosive wave energy.Crabbeâs team determined the surface area covered by the corals and entered the growth rates of the corals into a computer model to determine when in history the coral colonies first settled. They compared numbers of corals that started life in each year with hurricane and storm data, and as suggested by data from fringing reefs of Jamaica, the coral recruitment was much lower during storm years, Crabbe said.âThe rapid growth of the tourism industry in Belize over the past five years tops the list of threats to the corals,â and agricultural runoff is a close second, Martinez said.âClimate change is coming up the list very quickly,â Crabbe said."}

More than 50 people were evacuated from New Orleans, La., through the efforts of two \"core anchors,\" a 58-year-old woman and her daughter, who initiated communication and organization using established familial and social relationships.\"Women in normal times act as the glue for networks,\" Litt said. \"They coordinate networks of care giving, oversee the pooling of resources and know how to find each other. In emergencies, they use those same skills. That pre-existing interdependence, trust and knowledge is what made successful evacuations happen.\"Litt concurs with previous research that networks are central to survival in low-income families. The question she hoped to answer in her study was whether those networks crack under the pressure of emergency situations. Litt discovered the networks were successful during the Katrina evacuations for three reasons.First, government warnings did not appear to carry the same authority as the passing of informal knowledge through trusted network members. Second, women were the key to \"pulling together\" network ties already embedded in their daily lives. Through those network ties, women had previously been organizing child care and sharing money or job information. Third, the network recognized personal ties and allowed for expansion to include other individuals. For example, one person would not leave another behind.\"The importance of respecting and maintaining family and kin ties in disaster response, something we now see the government had no capacity to do, cannot be overestimated,\" Litt said. \"Any formal disaster planning should take into consideration, in a practical way, not only the existence but the usefulness of these networks. It's the order in the chaos.\"Litt's study was based on two years of research on the \"Katrina Diaspora\" (the flight of storm refugees to other parts of the United States). Litt conducted interviews and attended focus groups with approximately 80 evacuees in mid-Missouri and Baton Rouge, La., examining the significance of women's work in emergency evacuation. Her research will be published in a special issue of the National Women's Studies Association Journal (\"New Orleans: gender, the meaning of place, and the politics of displacement.\")"}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_586", "content": "The study, conducted by University of Michigan researcher Narayan Sastry and Tulane University's Mark VanLandingham, examines the mental health status of pre-Katrina residents of the City of New Orleans in the fall of 2006---one year after the hurricane. It also describes and analyzes disparities in mental health by race, education and income.Based on a pilot survey that drew a stratified, area-based probability sample of pre-Katrina dwellings in the city, the study is one of the first to provide data representative of the pre-hurricane population. It was designed by the RAND Corporation, a nonprofit research organization.A total of 144 individuals participated in the pilot study, including many who moved away from the area after the disaster and had not returned a year later. More than half the study participants were black, nearly two-thirds had a high school diploma or less education, and nearly 60 percent were unmarried. Nearly three-fourths were employed in the month before the hurricane hit.According to Sastry, who is affiliated with RAND and with the U-M Institute for Social Research (ISR), about 60 percent of study participants had no psychological distress at the time of the interview, while about 20 percent had mild-to-moderate mental illness and another 20 percent had serious mental illness.To assess mental illness, respondents were asked a series of questions from a widely used measure of general psychological distress. How often during the past 30 days, they were asked, did you feel nervous, hopeless, restless or fidgety, depressed, that everything was an effort, and worthless?Blacks reported substantially higher rates of serious psychological distress than whites, Sastry and Van Landingham reported. Almost one-third of blacks were found to have a high degree of distress, compared to just six percent of whites. Those with higher incomes and more education were much less likely to experience serious psychological distress, and those born in Louisiana were much more likely to have serious distress.The researchers also examined how the extent of housing damage was related to psychological distress a year after the disaster. They found that those who lost their homes were five times more likely than those who did not to have serious psychological distress. In all, about 66 percent of the respondents reported that their homes were badly damaged or unlivable.\"Our findings suggest that severe damage to one's home is a particularly important factor behind socioeconomic disparities in psychological distress, and possibly behind the levels of psychological distress,\" Sastry said. \"These effects may be partly economic, because, for most families who own their home, home equity is the largest element of household wealth.\"Apart from the financial losses, severely damaged or destroyed housing may prevent people who want to return to New Orleans from doing so because they lack a place to live. This affects their social ties, their employment, and many other factors.\"The magnitude and permanence of a housing loss suggests that for many people, the psychological consequences of this experience could be profound and lasting.\"Sastry and VanLandingham emphasize that these findings are preliminary, and that a larger study is now being planned."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_587", "content": "Kerry Emanuel, the lead author of the new study, wrote a paper in 2005 reporting an apparent link between a warming climate and an increase in hurricane intensity. That paper attracted worldwide attention because it was published in Nature just three weeks before Hurricane Katrina slammed into New Orleans.Emanuel, a professor of atmospheric science in MIT's Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences, says the new research provides an independent validation of the earlier results, using a completely different approach. The paper was co-authored by postdoctoral fellow Ragoth Sundararajan and graduate student John Williams and recently appeared in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society.While the earlier study was based entirely on historical records of past hurricanes, showing nearly a doubling in the intensity of Atlantic storms over the last 30 years, the new work is purely theoretical. It made use of a new technique to add finer-scale detail to computer simulations called Global Circulation Models, which are the basis for most projections of future climate change.\"It strongly confirms, independently, the results in the Nature paper,\" Emanuel said. \"This is a completely independent analysis and comes up with very consistent results.\"Worldwide, both methods show an increase in the intensity and duration of tropical cyclones, the generic name for what are known as hurricanes in the North Atlantic. But the new work shows no clear change in the overall numbers of such storms when run on future climates predicted using global climate models.However, Emanuel says, the new work also raises some questions that remain to be understood. When projected into the future, the model shows a continuing increase in power, \"but a lot less than the factor of two that we've already seen\" he says. \"So we have a paradox that remains to be explained.\"There are several possibilities, Emanuel says. \"The last 25 years' increase may have little to do with global warming, or the models may have missed something about how nature responds to the increase in carbon dioxide.\"Another possibility is that the recent hurricane increase is related to the fast pace of increase in temperature. The computer models in this study, he explains, show what happens after the atmosphere has stabilized at new, much higher CO2 concentrations. \"That's very different from the process now, when it's rapidly changing,\" he says.In the many different computer runs with different models and different conditions, \"the fact is, the results are all over the place,\" Emanuel says. But that doesn't mean that one can't learn from them. And there is one conclusion that's clearly not consistent with these results, he said: \"The idea that there is no connection between hurricanes and global warming, that's not supported,\" he says.The work was partly funded by the National Science Foundation."}

By analyzing in detail the trajectories of certain recent hurricanes such as Ivan, Jane, Nicholas, etc., the researchers measured the random factor that is always present in the movement of hurricanes. They then demonstrated the remarkable similarity of these fluctuations with those that characterize the disordered movement of the vortices that they created on soap bubbles.Taking this random factor into account in predicting the trajectory of hurricanes will be useful in anticipating the probability of impact on a given site or locality. Although the mean trajectory of hurricanes (without any fluctuations) is beginning to be well simulated by meteorologists, this random factor has, until now, been poorly understood. This discovery highlights a universality in the statistics of trajectory fluctuations and should make it possible in the future to better predict the behavior of hurricanes and anticipate the risks.Notes :1)  Laboratoire de GÃ©nie Industriel.2)  The skin or film of soap is only several microns thick whereas the diameter of the bubble is around ten centimeters.3) Law corresponding to a âLevy flightâ random type movement, in other words a type of random walk dominated by several jumps of limited number but of large amplitude.4)  With a similar superdiffusive law.Journal reference: Thermal convection and emergence of isolated vortices in soap bubbles, F.

With the help of VORTRAC, vulnerable communities can be better informed of sudden changes in hurricane intensity.\"Lee, NRL's Paul Harasti, and NCAR's Michael Bell led the technique's development. Funding came from NSF and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).One of VORTRAC's strengths is that it can use radar data to calculate the barometric pressure at the center of a hurricane, a key measure of its intensity.\"VORTRAC allows us to take the wind measurements from the radar, turn the crank, and have a central pressure drop out of a calculation,\" says Colin McAdie, a meteorologist at NHC. \"This will be a valuable addition to the tools available to the forecaster.\"Rapidly intensifying storms can catch vulnerable coastal areas by surprise. Last year, Hurricane Humberto struck near Port Arthur, Texas, after unexpectedly strengthening from a tropical depression to a hurricane in less than 19 hours. In 2004, parts of Florida's southwest coast were caught unprepared when Hurricane Charley's top winds increased from 110 to 145 miles per hour in just six hours as the storm neared land.Lee and his collaborators applied VORTRAC retroactively to the two hurricanes and found that the technique would have accurately tracked their quick bursts in intensity.\"VORTRAC has demonstrated that it can capture sudden intensity changes in potentially dangerous hurricanes in the critical time period when these storms are nearing land,\" Bell says.VORTRAC uses the Doppler radar network established by NOAA in the 1990s.About 20 of these radars are scattered along the Gulf and Atlantic coastlines from Texas to Maine. Each radar can measure winds blowing toward or away from it, but no single radar could provide an estimate of a hurricane's rotational winds and central pressure until now.The VORTRAC team developed a series of mathematical formulas that combine data from a single radar near the center of a landfalling storm with general knowledge of Atlantic hurricane structure in order to map the approaching system's rotational winds. VORTRAC also infers the barometric pressure in the eye of the hurricane, a very reliable index of its strength.\"By merging several techniques, we can now provide a missing link in short-term hurricane prediction,\" Harasti says.Forecasters using VORTRAC can update information about a hurricane each time a Doppler radar scans the storm, which can be as often as about every six minutes. Without such a technique, forecasters would need at least two coastal radars in close proximity to each other in order to obtain the same information. But most of the network's radars are too far apart to qualify.Each radar can sample conditions out to about 120 miles. This means VORTRAC can track an incoming hurricane for at least several hours, and possibly even as long as a day or more, depending on the storm's speed, trajectory, and size.To monitor the winds of a landfalling hurricane, forecasters now rely on aircraft to drop instrument packages into the storm that gather data on winds and pressure. But due to flight logistics, the aircraft can take readings no more than every few hours, which means that coastal communities may not be swiftly alerted to changes in approaching hurricanes.VORTRAC may also help improve long-range hurricane forecasts by using data from airborne Doppler radars or spaceborne radars to produce detailed information about a hurricane that is far out to sea.Forecasters could input the data to computer models to improve three- and five-day forecasts."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_590", "content": "So far, there's only one surefire way of measuring the strength of a hurricane: Sending airplanes to fly right through the most intense winds and into the eye of the storm, carrying out wind-speed measurements as they go.That's an expensive approach--the specialized planes used for hurricane monitoring cost about $100 million each, and a single flight costs about $50,000. Monitoring one approaching hurricane can easily require a dozen such flights, and so only storms that are approaching U.S. shores get such monitoring, even though the strongest storms occur in the Pacific basin (where they are known as tropical cyclones).Nicholas Makris, associate professor of mechanical and ocean engineering and director of MIT's Laboratory for Undersea Remote Sensing, thinks there may be a better way. By placing hydrophones (underwater microphones) deep below the surface in the path of an oncoming hurricane, it's possible to measure wind power as a function of the intensity of the sound. The roiling action of the wind, churning up waves and turning the water into a bubble-filled froth, causes a rushing sound whose volume is a direct indicator of the storm's destructive power.Makris has been doing theoretical work analyzing this potential method for years, triggered by a conversation he had with MIT professor and hurricane expert Kerry Emanuel. But now he has found the first piece of direct data that confirms his calculations. In a paper accepted for publication in Geophysical Research Letters, Makris and his former graduate student Joshua Wilson show that Hurricane Gert, in 1999, happened to pass nearly over a hydrophone anchored at 800 meters depth above the mid-Atlantic Ridge at about the latitude of Puerto Rico, and the same storm was monitored by airplanes within the next 24 hours.The case produced exactly the results that had been predicted, providing the first experimental validation of the method, Makris says. \"There was almost a perfect relationship between the power of the wind and the power of the wind-generated noise,\" he says. There was less than 5 percent error--about the same as the errors you get from aircraft measurements.Satellite monitoring is good at showing the track of a hurricane, Makris says, but not as reliable as aircraft in determining destructive power.The current warning systems are estimated to save $2.5 billion a year in the United States, and improved systems could save even more, he says. And since many parts of the world that are subject to devastating cyclones cannot afford the cost of hurricane-monitoring aircraft, the potential for saving lives and preventing devastating damage is even greater elsewhere.\"You need to know, do you evacuate or not?\" Makris explains. \"Both ways, if you get it wrong, there can be big problems.\"To that end, Makris has been collaborating with the Mexican Navy's Directorate of Oceanography, Hydrography and Meteorology, using a meteorological station on the island of Socorro, off Mexico's west coast. The island lies in one of the world's most hurricane-prone areas--an average of three cyclones pass over or near the island every year. The team installed a hydrophone in waters close to the island and are waiting for a storm to come by and provide further validation of the technique.Makris and Wilson estimate that when there's a hurricane on its way toward shore, a line of acoustic sensors could be dropped from a small plane into the ocean ahead of the storm's path, while conditions are still safe, and could then provide detailed information on the storm's strength to aid in planning and decision-making about possible evacuations. The total cost for such a deployment would be a small fraction of the cost of even a single flight into the storm, they figure.In addition, permanent lines of such sensors could be deployed offshore in storm-prone areas, such as the Sea of Bengal off India and Bangladesh. And such undersea monitors could have additional benefits besides warning of coming storms.The hydrophones could be a very effective way of monitoring the amount of sea salt entering the atmosphere as a result of the churning of ocean waves. This sea salt, it turns out, has a major impact on global climate because it scatters solar radiation that regulates the formation of clouds. Direct measurements of this process could help climate modelers to make more accurate estimates of its effects.The research has been supported by the U.S. Navy's Office of Naval Research, ONR Global-Americas, MIT Sea Grant and the Department of Homeland Security Science and Technology Directorate."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_591", "content": "\"Current oceanic and atmospheric trends indicate that we will likely have an active Atlantic basin hurricane season,\" said William Gray, who is beginning his 25th year forecasting hurricanes at Colorado State University.The team's forecast now anticipates 15 named storms forming in the Atlantic basin between June 1 and Nov. 30. Eight of the storms are predicted to become hurricanes, and of those eight, four are expected to develop into intense or major hurricanes (Saffir/Simpson category 3-4-5) with sustained winds of 111 mph or greater.Â Â Long-term averages are 9.6 named storms, 5.9 hurricanes and 2.3 intense hurricanes per year.\"Based on our latest forecast, the probability of a major hurricane making landfall along the U.S. coastline is 69 percent compared with the last-century average of 52 percent,\" said Phil Klotzbach of the Colorado State hurricane forecast team. \"We are calling for a very active hurricane season this year, but not as active as the 2004 and 2005 seasons.\"Current conditions in the Atlantic basin are quite favorable for an active hurricane season. The current sea surface temperature pattern in the Atlantic - prevalent in most years since 1995 - is a pattern typically observed before very active seasons. Warm sea surface temperatures are likely to continue being present in the tropical and North Atlantic during 2008 because of a positive phase of the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO). Also, the currently observed weak Azores High will likely promote weaker-than-normal trade winds over the next few months enhancing warm SST anomalies in the tropical and subtropical Atlantic.Additionally, the team expects neutral or weak La Nina conditions in the tropical Pacific, which, combined with a predicted warm north and tropical Atlantic, is a recipe for enhanced Atlantic basin hurricane activity. These factors are similar to conditions that occurred during the 1950, 1989, 1999, and 2000 seasons. The average of these four seasons had well above-average activity, and Klotzbach and Gray predict the 2008 season will have activity in line with the average of these four years.The hurricane forecast team predicts tropical cyclone activity in 2008 will be 160 percent of the average season. By comparison, 2005 witnessed tropical cyclone activity that was about 275 percent of the average season.The hurricane forecast team reiterated its probabilities for a major hurricane making landfall on U.S. soil:The team also predicted above-average major hurricane landfall risk in the Caribbean.\"The United States was quite fortunate over the last two years in that we had only one hurricane landfall (Humberto - 2007),\" Klotzbach said. \"None of the four major hurricanes that formed in 2006 and 2007 made U.S. landfall.\"The Colorado State hurricane forecast team has cautioned against reading too much into the hurricane seasons of 2004 and 2005 when Florida and the Gulf Coast were ravaged by four landfalling hurricanes each year. Hurricanes Charley, Frances, Ivan and Jeanne caused devastating damage in 2004 followed by Dennis, Katrina, Rita and Wilma in 2005.\"The activity of these two years was unusual, but within the natural bounds of hurricane variation,\" Gray said.Probabilities of tropical storm-force, hurricane-force and intense hurricane-force winds occurring at specific locations along the U.S. East and Gulf Coasts within a variety of time periods are listed on the forecast team's Landfall Probability Web site. The site provides U.S. landfall probabilities for 11 regions, 55 sub-regions and 205 individual counties along the U.S. coastline from Brownsville, Texas, to Eastport, Maine. The Web site, available to the public at The hurricane team's forecasts are based on the premise that global oceanic and atmospheric conditions - such as El Nino, sea surface temperatures and sea level pressures - that preceded active or inactive hurricane seasons in the past provide meaningful information about similar trends in future seasons.The team will issue seasonal updates of its 2008 Atlantic basin hurricane activity forecast on June 3, Aug. 5, Sept. 2 and Oct. 1.

The report finds that climate predictions used by transportation planners and engineers may no longer be reliable, however, in the face of new weather and climate extremes.  Infrastructure pushed beyond the range for which it was designed can become stressed and fail, as seen with loss of the U.S. 90 Bridge in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina.\"The time has come for transportation professionals to acknowledge and confront the challenges posed by climate change, and to incorporate the most current scientific knowledge into the planning of transportation systems,\" said Henry Schwartz Jr., past president and chairman of Svedrup/Jacobs Civil Inc., and chair of the committee that wrote the report.  \"It is now possible to project climate changes for large subcontinental regions, such as the Eastern United States, a scale better suited for considering regional and local transportation infrastructure.\"The committee identified five climate changes of particular importance to U.S. transportation;In addition to climate changes, there are a number of contributing factors that will likely lead to vulnerabilities in coastal-area transportation systems.  Population is projected to grow in coastal areas, which will boost demand for transportation infrastructure and increase the number of people and businesses potentially in harm's way; erosion and loss of wetlands have removed crucial buffer zones that once protected infrastructure; and an estimated 60,000 miles of coastal highways are already exposed to periodic storm flooding.\"Rising temperatures may trigger weather extremes and surprises, such as more rapid melting of the Arctic sea ice than projected,\" Schwartz said.  \"The highways that currently serve as evacuation routes and endure periodic flooding could be compromised with strong hurricanes and more intense precipitation, making some of these routes impassable.\"  Transportation providers will need to focus on evacuation planning and work more closely with weather forecasters and emergency planners.Infrastructure vulnerabilities will extend beyond coastal areas as the climate continues to change.  In the Midwest, for instance, increased intense precipitation could augment the severity of flooding, as occurred in 1993 when farmland, towns, and transportation routes were severely damaged from flooding along 500 miles of the Mississippi and Missouri river systems.On the other hand, drier conditions are likely to prevail in the watersheds supplying the St. Lawrence Seaway and the Great Lakes as well as the Upper Midwest river system.  Lower water levels would reduce vessel shipping capacity, seriously impairing freight movements in the region, such as occurred during the drought of 1988, which stranded barge traffic on the Mississippi River.  And in California, heat waves may increase wildfires that can destroy transportation infrastructure.Not all climate changes will be negative, however.  Marine transportation could benefit from more open seas in the Arctic, creating new and shorter shipping routes and reducing transport time and costs.  In cold regions, rising temperatures could reduce the costs of snow and ice control and would make travel conditions safer for passenger vehicles and freight.Preparing for projected climate changes will be costly.  Transportation decision makers continually make short- and long-term investment decisions that affect how the infrastructure will respond to climate change.  Response measures range from rehabilitating and retrofitting infrastructure to making major additions to constructing entirely new infrastructure.The committee noted the need for \"a more strategic, risk-based approach to investment decisions that trades off the costs of making the infrastructure more robust against the economic costs of failure.\"  In the future, climate changes in some areas may necessitate permanent alterations.  For example, roads, rail lines, and airport runways in low-lying coastal areas may become casualties of sea-level rise, requiring relocations or expensive protective measures, such as sea walls and levees.The report calls for the federal government to have a strong role in implementing many of its recommendations that require broad-based action or regulation, such as the creation of a clearinghouse for information on transportation and climate change; the establishment of a research program to re-evaluate existing design standards and develop new standards for addressing climate change; creation of an interagency working group on adaptation; changes in federal regulations regarding long-range planning guidelines and infrastructure rehabilitation requirements; and re-evaluation of the National Flood Insurance Program and updating flood insurance rate maps with climate change in mind.Many of the committee's recommendations need not wait for federal action.  Local governments and private infrastructure providers can begin to identify critical infrastructure that is particularly vulnerable to climate change.  Professional organizations can single out examples of best practices, and transportation planners and climate scientists can begin collaboration on the development of regional scenarios for likely climate-related changes and the data needed to analyze their impacts.  Focusing on the challenges now could help avoid costly transportation investments and disruptions to operations in the future.This report is a collaborative effort between the Transportation Research Board and the Division on Earth and Life Studies of the National Research Council.

{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_593", "content": "The biology of the nutria species allows it to reproduce at rapid speed, making it an unwieldy animal to control if released into the wild. A female nutria averages about five young per litter, but can birth as many as 13 at a time. A female can breed again within two days after giving birth, meaning one nutria can have up to three litters per year.To get a sense of their productivity, 20 nutria brought to Louisiana in the 1930s bred an estimated 20 million animals within two decades, according to a wildlife group in Maryland that tracks nutria data, quoted in a recent report by Louisiana journalist Chris Kirkham.Although nutria were brought to all parts of the country, said Kirkham's report , warm weather in Louisiana has boosted their numbers. Already under pressure from saltwater intrusion, the marshes also have to deal with the nutria and their voracious appetite for the vital marsh roots that keep wetlands intact.Professor Attygalle and his biological colleagues, Professor Thomas Eisner and Steven Finckbeiner believe they have located the correct chemical compounds that offer an alternative to free-form hunting and trapping, or ecologically harmful poisoning, in the management of the nutria population.\"Several volatile compounds, including terpenoids, fatty alcohols, fatty acids and some of their esters, were identified from solvent extracts prepared from anal scent glands of nutria, a.k.a. coypu,\" said Attygalle. \"These compounds can serve as a powerful attractant to the animals, and thus, when applied strategically, serve as a tool in the efforts to control their spread in the easily damaged coastal ecosphere.\"The major terpenoid constituents were identified as (E,E)-farnesol and its esters by a comparison of their gas chromatographic retention times, and electron-ionization (EI) and chemical-ionization (CI) mass spectra with those of authentic compounds. EI mass spectra of the four farnesol isomers are very similar, however, the ChemStation (Agilent) and GC--MS Solution (Shimadzu) software algorithms were able to identify the natural compound as the (E,E)-isomer, when a high-quality mass spectral library was compiled from reference samples and used for searching. Similarly, the esters were identified as those of (E,E)-farnesol. In contrast to EI spectra, the CI spectra of the (E,E)- and (E,Z)-isomers are distinctly different from those of the (Z,E)- and (Z,Z)-isomers.Moreover, the infrared spectrum of the (E,E)-isomer is distinctly different from those of the other three isomers in the 2962--2968 cm - and 2918--2922 cm 1 bands, which represent asymmetric CH3 and CH2 stretching vibrations, respectively. Finally, the GC retention indices of farnesol and farnesyl ester isomers determined from authentic samples were used to confirm all identifications.For many years, Tabasco sauce magnate E.A. McIlhenny received most of the blame for introducing the rodents from South America to Avery Island in the 1930s. McIlhenny wanted to expand the fur trade in Louisiana at that time, so he brought nutria from South America to his home on Avery Island, the story went. But a hurricane blew down the nutria pen, releasing them into the wild.The myth held for decades, sometimes perpetuated by family members themselves. Five years ago, a historian hired by the family found records that McIlhenny actually bought the nutria from a St. Bernard Parish fur dealer in 1938. He did eventually set the nutria loose, but not because of hurricane damage, said McIlhenny historian and curator Shane Bernard, quoted in reporter Kirkham's recent newspaper interview.\"I'm confident that all the myth has been stripped away,\" he said. \"Anybody who knows oral history or folklore knows how stories can change when they're passed down from one generation to the next.\"While Federal agencies have looked at various poisoning methods, none of those efforts has gone very far because of the effects on other species. The work of Professor Attygalle and his associates offers an environmentally friendly bait technique intended to lure nutria to traps for transport away from sensitive coastal zones and marshlands."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_594", "content": "âWe found that although some decades were quieter and less damaging in the U.S. and others had more land-falling hurricanes and more damage, the economic costs of land-falling hurricanes have steadily increased over time,â said Chris Landsea, one of the researchers as well as the science and operations officer at NOAAâs National Hurricane Center in Miami. âThere is nothing in the U.S. hurricane damage record that indicates global warming has caused a significant increase in destruction along our coasts.âIn a newly published paper in Natural Hazards Review, the researchers also found that economic hurricane damage in the U.S. has been doubling every 10 to 15 years. If more people continue to move to the hurricane-prone coastline, future economic hurricane losses may be far greater than previously thought.âUnless action is taken to address the growing concentration of people and property in coastal hurricane areas, the damage will increase by a great deal as more people and infrastructure inhabit these coastal locations,â said Landsea.The Natural Hazards Review  paper, âNormalized Hurricane Damage in the United States: 1900-2005,â was written by Roger A. Pielke Jr. (University of Colorado), Joel Gratz (ICAT Managers, Inc.), Chris Landsea, Douglas Collins (Tillinghast-Towers Perrin), Mark A. Saunders (University College London), and Rade Musulin (Aon Re Australia).The team used two different approaches, which gave similar results, to estimate the economic damages of historical hurricanes if they were to strike today, building upon the work published originally by Landsea and Pielke in 1998, and by Collins and Lowe in 2001. Both methods used changes in inflation and wealth at the national level. The first method utilized population increases at the county coastal level, while the second used changes in housing units at the county coastal level.The results illustrate the effects of the tremendous pace of growth in vulnerable hurricane areas. If the 1926 Great Miami Hurricane were to hit today, the study estimated it would cause the largest losses at $140 billion to $157 billion, with Hurricane Katrina second on the list at $81 billion.The team concludes that potential damage from storms â currently about $10 billion yearly â is growing at a rate that may place severe burdens on exposed communities, and that avoiding huge losses will require a change in the rate of population growth in coastal areas, major improvements in construction standards, or other mitigation actions."}

Itâs where the TransCanada Highway connecting New Brunswick and Nova Scotia goes through, along with the CN Rail Line. The dykes - built by the original Acadian settlers to transform tidal wetlands into rich farmland â are virtually unchanged since the 17th century.With the area at high risk because of climate change, the 22-year-old Dalhousie student is trying to determine what needs to be done: if dykes need to be reinforced or if salt marshes should be reclaimed. The Tantramar District Planning Commission is working on a rural plan and is interested in Ms. Hoodâs conclusions.âThe area is unplanned â itâs mostly farmland â and planning is really going to take a role as the commission draws up its plan,â says Ms. Hood.Meanwhile, Amanda Kosloskiâs research is looking at how climate change might affect land use along Halifax Harbour, from the Macdonald Bridge to Woodside Ferry Terminal on the Dartmouth side. Should wharves be modified, sea walls reinforced or development restricted?

Nova Scotia is anticipating the high-tide mark on the Atlantic coast will be at least 70 centimetres higher by the next century: thatâs a projected sea level rise of 40 centimetres coupled with the land subsiding by 30 centimetres. Melting glaciers, a melting ice cap and the fact that warmer water takes up more volume than cold are behind the predictions.But climate change isnât a far-off concept: significant weather events such as the spring flood of 2003, Hurricane Juan in September 2003 and White Juan in February 2004 indicates climate change is already affecting Nova Scotia.âAs planners, our job is to think ahead,â says Ms. Kosloski, a 26-year-old in the second year of her masterâs degree. âWe can have a hand in preventing potential problems.âMs. Hood, from Stanley, N.B., and Amanda Kosloski, from Richmond Hill, Ont., were each awarded $5,000 fellowships, offered jointly through Natural Resources Canada, Canadian Institute of Planners and Association of Canadian University Planning Program.

{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_596", "content": "\"At least one third of the recent increase in Atlantic Ocean temperatures is due to a decrease in dust storms,\" says lead author Amato Evan, a researcher at UW-Madison's Cooperative Institute for Meteorological Satellite Studies (CIMSS).In a paper published online in \"Geochemistry, Geophysics, Geosystems,\" the team of scientists describes how dust in the atmosphere cools the ocean by decreasing the amount of energy that reaches the water. The study also demonstrated that the large amount of dust blowing off of Africa in the 1980s and '90s likely cooled the Atlantic enough to prevent conditions that could have resulted in more devastating hurricane seasons similar to 2004 and 2005.As dust from Africa accumulates in the skies over the Atlantic, the atmosphere above the ocean begins to resemble the conditions over Africa. Millions of tons of dust create a drier environment and also reduce the amount of sunlight that reaches the ocean. Using a 25-year data record created by co-author Andrew Heidinger, a researcher with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Evan assessed how much the dust cooled the temperature of the ocean.\"It's not just one dust storm,\" Evan says. \"It's the cumulative effect of several months of dust storms.\"The 2007 Atlantic hurricane season, for example, was much quieter than predicted and the Atlantic was cooler than in previous years. Evan suggests that the relative lack of hurricane activity and cool ocean temperatures could be partially due to a particularly dusty spring and early summer. 2007 was the dustiest year since 1999.By putting satellite observations and other atmospheric information into a computer simulation, Evan assessed how much energy reached the ocean with the dust in the atmosphere and then again after removing the dust. Evan found that dust cools the Atlantic by an average of one degree Celsius, about two degrees Fahrenheit, each year. In years with a lot of dust activity, such as the 1980s, the dust had a larger cooling effect.In a study published in fall 2006 in \"Geophysical Research Letters,\" Evan demonstrated that the intensity of hurricane seasons in the Atlantic increased when the amount of dust blowing off of Africa decreased and vice versa. The study published today is an effort to explain why this relationship exists and what the past few decades would have looked like without the effects of dust.  Evan says these results confirm a direct connection between the intensity of dust storms in Africa and that of hurricanes in the Atlantic.Because of the direct relationship, the amount of dust in the atmosphere could contribute to hurricane season forecasts. \"Dust prediction is another tool to diagnose hurricane activity,\" Evan says. Evan has done some preliminary work to develop an effective way to use satellite observations to predict dust activity up to nine months in advance.Dust storms in Africa have a significant impact on the temperature of the Atlantic Ocean, which, in turn, plays a large role in hurricane activity. Although climate change has taken the spotlight in media conversations about hurricanes, many factors influence these complicated storms. Of the effects of global warming, Evan says: \"It's real, but that's not all there is.\""}

The geochronology data indicates four major episodes when lava flows either erupted into the canyon or flowed over the rim into it: 725-475 thousand years ago (ka), 400-275 ka, 225-150 ka, and 150-75 ka.These flows formed lava dams in western Grand Canyon that had dramatic impact on the Colorado River.This paper* presents light detection and ranging (lidar) data to establish the elevations of the tops and bottoms of basalt flow remnants along the river corridor. These data show the original extent of now-dissected intra-canyon flows and aid in correlation of flow remnants.From 725 to 475 ka, volcanism built a high edifice within Grand Canyon in the area of the Toroweap fault, with dike-cored cinder cones on both rims and within the canyon itself. These large-volume eruptions helped drive the far-traveled basalt flows which flowed down-canyon over 120 km. A second episode of volcanism, from 400 to 275 ka, built a 215-m-high dam along the Hurricane fault, about 15 km downstream.The ca. 200 and 100 ka flows (previously mapped as Gray Ledge) were smaller flows and lava cascades that entered the canyon from the north rim between the Toroweap and Hurricane faults.The combined results suggest a new model for the spatial and temporal distribution of volcanism in Grand Canyon in which composite lava dams and edifices were generally leaky in proximal areas.Available data suggest that the demise of volcanic edifices may have involved either large outburst-flood events or normal fluvial deposition at times when the river was established on top of basalt flows. These data highlight complex interactions of volcanism and fluvial processes in this classic locality.This research, authored by Ryan Crow (University of New Mexico) et al. was published in the February issue of Geosphere, published by the Geological Society of America."}

To quantify the role of sea warming it was necessary to first understand the separate contributions of atmospheric circulation and sea surface temperature to the increase in hurricane frequency and activity.Professor Saunders, the lead author of the study, explained how this was done. \"We created a statistical model based on two environmental variables -- local sea surface temperature and an atmospheric wind field - which replicated 75-80 per cent of the variance in tropical Atlantic hurricane activity and frequency between 1965 and 2005. By removing the influence of winds from the model we were able to assess the contribution of sea surface temperature and found that it has a large effect. \"\"Our analysis does not identify whether greenhouse gas-induced warming contributed to the increase in water temperature and thus to the increase in hurricane activity. However, it is important that climate models are able to reproduce the observed relationship between hurricane activity and sea surface temperature so that we can have confidence in their reliability to project how hurricane activity will respond to future climate change.\"Journal reference: Large contribution of sea surface warming to recent increase in Atlantic hurricane activity, by Prof Mark A.

{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_599", "content": "The article, to be published on January 23 in Geophysical Research Letters, uses observations to show that warming of global sea surface temperatures is associated with a secular, or sustained long-term increase, of vertical wind shear in the main development region for Atlantic hurricanes. The increased vertical wind shear coincides with a downward trend in U.S. landfalling hurricanes.âWe looked at U.S. landfalling hurricanes because it is the most reliable Atlantic hurricane measurement over the long term,â says Chunzai Wang, a physical oceanographer and climate scientist with NOAAâs Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory in Miami and lead author on the article. âUsing data extending back to the middle nineteenth century, we found a gentle decrease in the trend of U.S. landfalling hurricanes when the global ocean is warmed up. This trend coincides with an increase in vertical wind shear over the tropical North Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico, which could result in fewer U.S. landfalling hurricanes.â For the article, Wang worked with Sang-Ki Lee of the Cooperative Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Studies-University of Miami.In terms of hurricane strength, Wang notes, âThe vertical wind shear is not the only factor affecting Atlantic hurricane activity, although it is an important one.â Other factors include atmospheric humidity, sea level pressure, and sea surface temperature.Â This study also suggests that where the global ocean warming occurs is important for determining the vertical wind shear in the Atlantic hurricane main development region â within the 10Â°-20Â° North latitude belt that stretches from west Africa to Central America. Whether future global warming increases Atlantic hurricane activity will probably depend on the relative role induced by sustained long-term warming over the tropical oceans.Observations from 1854 to 2006 show a warming of sea surface temperature occurring almost everywhere over the global ocean, with large warming in tropical regions of the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian oceans. Warmer waters in the tropical Pacific, Indian and North Atlantic oceans produce opposite effects upon vertical wind shear; that is, warming in the tropical Pacific and Indian oceans increase vertical wind shear in the Atlantic hurricane main development region, while warming in the tropical North Atlantic decreases vertical wind shear. Overall, warming in the Pacific and Indian oceans is of greater impact and produces increased levels of vertical wind shear which suppresses Atlantic hurricane activity.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, an agency of the U.S. Commerce Department, is dedicated to enhancing economic security and national safety through the prediction and research of weather and climate-related events and information service delivery for transportation, and by providing environmental stewardship of our nation's coastal and marine resources.

To fight against this rapid destruction, the two universities joined forces in 2003, forming an ongoing research partnership with the goal of rebuilding the vanishing coastal wetland ecosystem that makes up 30 percent of the nationâs total coastal marsh.Researchers also aim to reduce the flow of nitrogen and other chemicals that pour into the Mississippi River each spring from Americaâs heartland. This causes an overabundance of nutrients that rob the water of oxygen, creating a dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico â more than 975 square miles of low-oxygen water that limits the sustainable fisheries of the region.âThis is a multi-billion-dollar problem that affects our entire nation,â said LSU Chancellor Sean OâKeefe. âWhile we battle on the football field, we collaborate in the research field to tackle the issue of coastal wetlands loss.âLouisianaâs wetlands help to make the state the nationâs leader in crude oil production and second in natural gas production, according to Americaâs Wetland Foundation. These fragile ecosystems also support 25 percent of the nationâs total commercial fishing haul and provide storm protection to five of the countryâs largest ports. Wetlands are essential because of their capability to filter the nutrients that would contribute to the dead zone before they get carried into the Gulf; theyâre also vital for hurricane protection in storm-sensitive areas like New Orleans.âLouisiana has both the largest amount of wetland loss and the largest dead zone in the country,â said Robert Twilley, associate vice chancellor of research and economic development at LSU, director of the Coastal Systems and Society Agenda, professor of coastal sciences and leader of the Shell Coastal Environmental Modeling Laboratory, or CEML. âWeâre working hard to rebuild our wetlands and reduce nutrients to the Gulf of Mexico, but we canât do it alone.âThatâs where OSU comes in.While LSU scientists focus on Louisiana, addressing the issues of dramatic wetland loss and the continuously growing dead zone, OSU researchers are developing wetlands upstream so that nutrient loads in the Mississippi that would increase the size of the dead zone will be dramatically reduced by the time they reach the delta region."}

This currently establishes 2007 as the eighth warmest on record. Only February and April were cooler-than-average, while March and August were second warmest in the 113-year record.The warmer-than-average conditions in 2007 influenced residential energy demand in opposing ways, as measured byÂ the nationâs Residential Energy Demand Temperature Index. Using this index, NOAA scientists determined that the U.S. residential energy demand was about three percent less during the winter and eight percent higher during the summer than what would have occurred under average climate conditions.Exceptional warmth in late March was followed by a record cold outbreak from the central Plains to the Southeast in early April. The combination of premature growth from the March warmth and the record-breaking freeze behind it caused more than an estimated $1 billion in losses to crops (agricultural and horticultural).A severe heat wave affected large parts of the central and southeastern U.S. in August, setting more than 2,500 new daily record highs.The global annual temperature â for combined land and ocean surfaces â for 2007 is expected to be near 58.0 F â and would be the fifth warmest since records began in 1880. Some of the largest and most widespread warm anomalies occurred from eastern Europe to central Asia.Including 2007, seven of the eight warmest years on record have occurred since 2001 and the 10 warmest years have all occurred since 1997. The global average surface temperature has risen between 0.6Â°C and 0.7Â°C since the start of the twentieth century, and the rate of increase since 1976 has been approximately three times faster than the century-scale trend.The greatest warming has taken place in high latitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. Anomalous warmth in 2007 contributed to the lowest Arctic sea ice extent since satellite records began in 1979, surpassing the previous record low set in 2005 by a remarkable 23 percent. According to the National Snow and Ice Data Center, this is part of a continuing trend in end-of-summer Arctic sea ice extent reductions of about 10 percent per decade since 1979.Severe to exceptional drought affected the Southeast and western U.S. More than three-quarters of the Southeast was in drought from mid-summer into December. Increased evaporation from usually warm temperatures, combined with a lack of precipitation, worsened drought conditions. Drought conditions also affected large parts of the Upper Midwest and areas of the Northeast.Water conservation measures and drought disasters, or states of emergency, were declared by governors in at least five southeastern states, along with California, Oregon, Maryland, Connecticut, and Delaware at some point during the year.A series of storms brought flooding, millions of dollars in damages and loss of life from Texas to Kansas and Missouri in June and July. Making matters worse were the remnants of Tropical Storm Erin, which produced heavy rainfall in the same region in August.Drought and unusual warmth contributed to another extremely active wildfire season. Approximately nine million acres burned through early December, most of it in the contiguous U.S., according to preliminary estimates by the National Interagency Fire Center.There were 15 named storms in the Atlantic Basin (Atlantic Ocean, Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico) in 2007, four more than the long-term average. Six storms developed into hurricanes, including Hurricanes Dean and Felix, two category 5 storms that struck Mexicoâs Yucatan Peninsula and Nicaragua, respectively (the first two recorded category 5 landfalls in the Atlantic Basin in the same year). No major hurricanes made landfall in the U.S., but three tropical depressions, one tropical storm and one Category 1 Hurricane made landfall along the Southeast and Gulf coasts.La NiÃ±a conditions developed during the latter half of 2007, and by the end of November, sea surface temperatures near the equator of the eastern Pacific were more than 3.6Â°F (2Â°C) below average.

{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_603", "content": "In the debate over the effect of global warming on hurricanes, it is generally assumed that warmer oceans provide a more favorable environment for hurricane development and intensification. However, several other factors, such as atmospheric temperature and moisture, also come into play.Drs. Gabriel A. Vecchi of the NOAA Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory and Brian J. Soden from the University of Miami Rosenstiel School of Marine & Atmospheric Science analyzed climate model projections and observational reconstructions to explore the relationship between changes in sea surface temperature and tropical cyclone 'potential intensity' - a measure that provides an upper limit on cyclone intensity. They found that warmer oceans do not alone produce a more favorable environment for storms because the effect of remote warming can counter, and sometimes overwhelm, the effect of local surface warming. \"Warming near the storm acts to increase the potential intensity of hurricanes, whereas warming away from the storms acts to decrease their potential intensity,\" Vecchi said. Their study found that long-term changes in potential intensity are more closely related to the regional pattern of warming than to local ocean temperature change. Regions that warm more than the tropical average are characterized by increased potential intensity, and vice versa. \"A surprising result is that the current potential intensity for Atlantic hurricanes is about average, despite the record high temperatures of the Atlantic Ocean over the past decade.\" Soden said. \"This is due to the compensating warmth in other ocean basins.\" \"As we try to understand the future changes in hurricane intensity, we must look beyond changes in Atlantic Ocean temperature. If the Atlantic warms more slowly than the rest of the tropical oceans, we would expect a decrease in the upper limit on hurricane intensity,\" Vecchi added. \"This is an interesting piece of the puzzle.\"\"While these results challenge some current notions regarding the link between climate change and hurricane activity, they do not contradict the widespread scientific consensus on the reality of global warming,\" Soden noted.The journal article is entitled \"Effect of Remote Sea Surface Temperature Change on Tropical Cyclone Potential Intensity.\""}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_604", "content": "A new study that provides insight into what kind of storms are best at tackling drought in the southeastern United States. The study focuses on a decade of first-ever daily rainfall measurements by a NASA satellite carrying a weather radar in space. The study's authors believe the same insights can be applied by meteorologists and public officials to other regions where daily satellite rainfall data and storm tracking data are available.In the wake of Hurricane Katrina, meteorologist Marshall Shepherd, an associate professor of geography and atmospheric sciences at the University of Georgia, Athens, and colleagues delved into the ongoing debate about whether global warming is leading to an increase in rainfall intensity. The researchers wanted to determine how much rainfall each type of cyclone, from tropical depressions to category five hurricanes, contributes to overall rainfall. They focused the study on the Southeast in the hope that results could be harnessed to improve drought relief information for the region. Their findings were published today in the American Geophysical Union's Geophysical Research Letters.\"As much of the Southeast experiences record drought, our findings indicate that weak tropical systems could significantly contribute to rainfall totals that can bring relief to the region,\" said Shepherd, lead author of the NASA-funded study. \"These types of storms are significant rain producers. The larger hurricanes aren't frequent enough to produce most of the actual rain during the season and therefore are not the primary storm type that relieves drought in the region.\"Shepherd created a new measurement method as an efficient way to get a real sense for how much rainfall each type of storm contributes in a given year around the coastal regions of the southeastern U.S. To do so, he had to distinguish an average rainfall day from an extreme rainfall day. Though data from NASA's Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite could offer daily rainfall amounts, the data could not be used to set apart whether rainfall was average or extreme for any given day.Shepherd and his team modeled their metric on the \"cooling degree day\" that energy companies use to relate daily temperature to energy needs for air conditioning. A cooling degree day is found by subtracting 65 degrees from the average daily temperature. Values larger than zero give some indication whether a day was abnormally warm. Shepherd used daily rainfall data from TRMM to determine 28.9 as the base value of average daily rainfall at one of the world's wettest locations, Maui's Mount Wailea in Hawaii. In the same way as the cooling degree day, the \"millimeter day\" metric is calculated by subtracting 28.9 millimeters from the average daily rainfall in each of four ocean basins along coastal areas scattered across the south near Houston and New Orleans, east of Miami and south of North Carolina. Values greater than zero indicate a so-called \"wet millimeter day\" of extreme rainfall.Using daily rainfall data from the TRMM satellite from 1998-2006, Shepherd's team compared the amount of rain that fell in the basins on extreme rainfall days with the location of tropical storms from the National Hurricane Center's storm tracking database to determine how many extreme rainfall days were associated with a particular type of tropical storm.The team found that the most extreme rainfall days occurred in September and October, two of the busiest months of the Atlantic hurricane season. They also found that though major hurricanes produced the heaviest rainfall on any given day, the smaller tropical storms and depressions collectively produced the most rainfall over the entire season. Over half of the rainfall during the hurricane season attributed to cyclones of any type came from weaker tropical depressions and storms, compared to 27 percent from category 3-5 hurricanes.TRMM has transformed the way researchers like Shepherd measure rainfall by providing day-to-day information that did not exist before the satellite's 1997 launch. \"Though we've had monthly rainfall data available since 1979 from other sources, it's the daily rainfall data that allows us to see that tropical storm days contributed most significantly to cumulative rainfall for the season due to how frequently that kind of storm occurs,\" said Shepherd.\"It's important in the future to build a longer record of daily rainfall to establish, with better confidence, whether trends are occurring,\" said Shepherd. \"This study sets the stage for us to understand how much rainfall weak and strong tropical cyclones contribute annually and whether this contribution is trending upward in response to global warming-fueled growth in tropical cyclones.\"Shepherd believes advances that will improve study of cyclones and rainfall are \"just around the corner\" with NASA's Global Precipitation Measurement satellite, scheduled for launch in 2013. An extension of TRMM's capabilities, it will measure precipitation at higher latitudes, the actual size of snow and rain particles, and distinguish between rain and snow."}

The telephone survey was conducted between Jan. 19 and March 31, 2006, five to seven months after the storm. Participants were asked about stressors related to the hurricane and screened for symptoms of mood and anxiety disorders--which include depression, panic disorders and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)--within 30 days of the interview.A total of 31.2 percent of the participants had an anxiety-mood disorder, including 49.1 percent of the New Orleans metropolitan area residents and 26.4 percent of the other participants. Among all participants, 16.3 percent had PTSD; this included 30.3 percent of New Orleans residents and 12.5 percent of the others. Individuals who were younger than age 60, female, did not graduate college, had a low family income or were unmarried or unemployed before the hurricane were more likely to have anxiety-mood disorders, and those who were Hispanic or other minorities excluding blacks had lower rates of these conditions.\"The vast majority of respondents both in the New Orleans metro (91.9 percent) and in the remainder of the sample (81.7 percent) reported experiencing at least one of the 10 categories of hurricane-related stressors,\" including the death of a loved one, robbery, injury or property loss, the authors write. Among New Orleans residents, the extent of exposure to these stressors was more strongly related to anxiety-mood disorders than among residents of other areas. While New Orleans residents were most likely to develop anxiety-mood disorders following physical illness or injury and physical adversity, the rest of the participants were more likely to develop such a disorder following property loss.The rate of anxiety and mood disorders in New Orleans residents was higher than that typically found in studies of mental illness following natural disasters in the United States, while the rate among the other respondents was roughly equivalent, the authors note. In addition, they conclude, \"evidence that avoidable stressors associated with the slow government response to Hurricane Katrina (e.g., physical adversity) had important implications for the mental health of people who lived through Katrina argues strongly for the importance of efficient provision of practical and logistical assistance in future disasters, not only on humanitarian grounds, but also as a way to minimize the adverse mental health effects of disasters.\" \tJournal reference: Arch Gen Psychiatry. 2007;64(12):1427-1434.

{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_606", "content": "University of Wisconsin-Madison scientists have found that the Atlantic organizes the ingredients for a powerful hurricane season to create a situation where either everything is conducive to hurricane activity or nothing is-potentially making the Atlantic more vulnerable to climate change than the world's other hurricane hot spots.After the 2004 and 2005 hurricane seasons, many worry what Atlantic hurricane seasons will look like in a warmer world. Evidence indicates that higher ocean temperatures add a lot of fuel to these devastating storms. In a paper published today in the \"Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society,\" co-authors Jim Kossin and Dan Vimont caution against only looking at one piece of the puzzle. \"Sea surface temperature is a bit overrated,\" says Kossin, an atmospheric scientist at UW-Madison's Cooperative Institute of Meteorological Satellite Studies. \"It's part of a larger pattern.\"Kossin and Vimont, a professor in the Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences, noticed that warmer water is just one part of a larger pattern indicating that the conditions are right for more frequent, stronger hurricanes in the Atlantic. The atmosphere reacts to ocean conditions and the ocean reacts to the atmospheric situation, creating a distinct circulation pattern known as the Atlantic Meridional Mode (AMM). The AMM unifies the connections among the factors that influence hurricanes such as ocean temperature, characteristics of the wind, and moisture in the atmosphere.Finding that a basin-wide circulation pattern drives Atlantic hurricane activity helps explain evidence of significant differences in long-term hurricane trends among the world's basins. In a study published last February, Kossin and his co-authors created a more consistent record of hurricane data that accounted for the significant improvement in storm detection that followed the advent of weather satellites. An analysis of this recalibrated data showed that hurricanes have become stronger and more frequent in the Atlantic Ocean over the last two decades. The increasing trend, however, is harder to identify in the world's other oceans.Kossin and Vimont wanted to determine why long-term trends in the Atlantic looked different from those in other basins, particularly in the Pacific, where the majority of the world's hurricane activity occurs. \"The AMM helps us understand why hurricanes in the Atlantic react differently to climate changes than those in the Pacific,\" Vimont says. According to Vimont, the other oceanic basins have their own modes of variability.  \tUnderstanding how factors vary together provides a new framework from which to consider climate change and hurricanes. \"Our study broadens the interpretation of the hurricane-climate relationship,\" Vimont says.Looking at the larger set of varying conditions provides a more coherent understanding of how climate change affects hurricane activity. In the Atlantic, warmer water indicates that other conditions are also ideal for hurricane development. However, in the Pacific, a hurricane-friendly environment goes along with cooler ocean temperatures in the area where the storms spend their lives. The inconsistent relationship with sea surface temperature leads Vimont and Kossin to conclude that the connection between hurricane activity and climate variability hinges on more than just changes in ocean temperatures.\"You can never isolate one factor on this planet,\" Kossin says. \"Everything is interrelated.\"Depending on the other conditions hurricanes care about, warmer oceans can mean different outcomes. Concentrating on how the atmosphere and the ocean work together helps hurricane researchers see the bigger picture. Because higher sea surface temperatures in the Atlantic act in concert with the AMM, Vimont and Kossin suggest that Atlantic hurricanes will be more sensitive to climate changes than storms in other ocean basins.In addition to helping researchers understand and predict the effects of climate change on hurricane activity, Vimont and Kossin can forecast the AMM up to a year in advance. If the AMM is positive, all the conditions are right for hurricane development. If it is negative, those living on the coasts can generally expect a quieter hurricane season. Vimont and Kossin plan to further develop their AMM forecasts for use during the hurricane season. The duo also hopes to continue to research the physical relationships that constitute the AMM as well as how future climate change will affect these modes of climate variability."}

For instance, migrants clash over jobs, resources and way of life, and violent interactions such as theft, beating, armed scuffles, seizure of resources and property, murders and insurgencies are likely.In order to minimize the impact of environmental migrations, which can cause violent conflict in areas receiving migrants, Reuveny says developed countries would be wise to invest in preventive strategies both at home and in developing countries â since climate change is expected to degrade the environment considerably this century.Reuvenyâs analysis of three case studies â the US Dust Bowl in the 1930s; Bangladesh since the 1950s; and Hurricane Katrina in 2005 â shows that although climate change can spur large population movements, public policy can alleviate the pressures of ecomigration.Â  Indeed, if a country can invest in areas affected by environmental problems, the scope of ecomigration can be reduced and transitions can be smoother as more people are likely to return to the area.In Reuvenyâs view, âminimizing climate change-induced migration and violent conflict in receiving areas requires an engineered economic slowdown in the developed countries, and population stabilization and economic growth in developing countries financed by the developed countries.â These policies form the basis of the five-step approach he advocates to policy makers.1.Â Reuveny R (2007).

{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_608", "content": "\"We are not the first to come up with an estimate of the number of undercounted storms,\" says Michael E. Mann, associate professor of meteorology, Penn State, and director of the Earth System Science Center. \tIn the past, some researchers assumed that a constant percentage of all the storms made landfall and so they compared the number of tropical storms making landfall with the total number of reported storms for that year.   Other researchers looked at ship logs and ship tracks to determine how likely a tropical storm would have been missed.  In the early 1900s and before, there were probably not sufficient ships crossing the Atlantic to ensure full coverage. \tThe researchers report in the current issue of Geophysical Review Letters \"that the long-term record of historical Atlantic tropical cyclone counts is likely largely reliable, with an average undercount bias at most of approximately one tropical storm per year back to 1870.\" \tThe previously estimated undercounts of three or more storms are inaccurate. \t\"We have a very accurate count of Atlantic tropical cyclones beginning in 1944 when aircraft became common,\" says Mann.  \"In the 1970s, satellites were added to that mix.\" \tWith more than 60 years of accurate hurricane counts, the researchers, who included Thomas Sabbatelli, an undergraduate in meteorology and the Schreyer Honors College at Penn State, and Urs Neu, a research scientist at ProClim, Swiss Academy of Sciences, looked at other, independent ways to determine the number of hurricanes before 1944. \tThey looked at how the cycle of El Nino/La Nina, the pattern of the northern hemisphere jet stream and tropical Atlantic sea surface temperatures influence tropical storm generation by creating a model that includes these three climate variables.  The information is available back to 1870.   \tThe statistical model proved successful in various tests of accuracy.  The model also predicted 15 total Atlantic tropical storms with an error margin of 4 before the current season began.  So far, 14 storms have formed, with a little more than one week left in the season. \tThe model, trained on the tropical storm occurrence information from 1944 to 2006 showed an undercount before 1944 of 1.2 storms per year. When the researchers considered a possible undercount of three storms per year, their model predicted too few storms total.  The model only works in the range of around 1.2 undercounted storms per year with the climate data available.  The model was statistically significant in its findings. \t\"Fifty percent of the variation in storm numbers from one year to the next appears to be predictable in terms of the three key climate variables we used,\" says Mann.  \"The other 50 percent appears to be pure random variation.  The model ties the increase in storm numbers over the past decade to increasing tropical ocean surface temperatures. \t\"We cannot explain the warming trend in the tropics without considering human impacts on climate.  This is not a natural variation,\" says Mann. \t\"This . . . supports other work suggesting that increases in frequency, as well as powerfulness, of Atlantic tropical cyclones are potentially related to long-term trends in tropical Atlantic sea surface temperatures, trends that have in turn been connected to anthropogenic influences on climate,\" the researchers report."}

Syndromic surveillance in New Orleans, Louisiana, following these hurricanes indicated that 22 percent of diseases treated were dermatologic conditions (i.e., skin or wound infections and rashes).\"Rebecca Noe, M.P.H., at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, and colleagues analyzed the results of surveys, skin biopsy specimens and the environmental exposures of 136 civilian construction workers working and living at a New Orleans military base between August 2005 and October 2005. Many of these workers lived in wooden huts and tents with limited sanitation facilities.  \"Of 136 workers, 58 reported rash, yielding an attack rate of 42.6 percent,\" the authors write. Forty-one (70.7 percent) of those who reported a rash were examined for diagnosis. Twenty-seven (65.9 percent) were found to have papular urticaria, a sensitivity reaction to insect bites resulting in solid raised bumps on the skin; eight (19.5 percent) had bacterial folliculitis, an infection causing inflammation around the hair follicles; six (14.6 percent) had fiberglass dermatitis, an irritation and inflammation of the skin from contact with fiberglass; and two (4.9 percent) had brachioradial photodermatitis, an abnormal skin reaction to sunlight causing irritation and burning in the arms. Workers who were Native American, worked as roofers or slept in huts that had sustained flooding during Hurricane Katrina were more likely to suffer from papular urticaria than other workers. Native American workers were also more likely to develop fiberglass dermatitis than workers of another race. \"A suspected mite infestation of flooded housing units is the most plausible hypothesis, although we were unable to identify the arthropod [such as insects, spiders and scorpions] source,\" the authors conclude. \"People working and living in post-hurricane environments where flooding has occurred may be at an increased risk of exposure to arthropods.

{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_611", "content": "The August 2005 hurricane affected five million acres of forest across Mississippi, Louisiana and Alabama, with damage ranging from downed trees, snapped trunks and broken limbs to stripped leaves.Young growing forests play a vital role in removing carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, from the atmosphere by photosynthesis, and are thus important in slowing a warming climate. An event that kills a great number of trees can temporarily reduce photosynthesis, the process by which carbon is stored in plants. More importantly, all the dead wood will be consumed by decomposers, resulting in a large carbon dioxide release to the atmosphere as the ecosystem exhales it as forest waste product.\"The loss of so many trees will cause these forests to be a net source of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere for years to come,\" said the study's lead author Jeffrey Chambers, a biologist at Tulane University in New Orleans, La. \"If, as many believe, a warming climate causes a rise in the intensity of extreme events like Hurricane Katrina, we're likely to see an increase in tree mortality, resulting in an elevated release of carbon by impacted forest ecosystems.\"Young forests are valued as carbon sinks, which remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and store it in growing vegetation and soils. In the aftermath of a storm as intense as Katrina, vegetation killed by the storm decomposes over time, reversing the carbon storage process, making the forest a carbon source.\"The carbon cycle is intimately linked to just about everything we do, from energy use to food and timber production and consumption,\" said Chambers. \"As more and more carbon is released to the atmosphere by human activities, the climate warms, triggering an intensification of the global water cycle that produces more powerful storms, leading to destruction of more trees, which then act to amplify climate warming.\"Chambers and colleagues from the University of New Hampshire in Durham, N.H., studied Landsat 5 satellite data captured before and after Hurricane Katrina to pull together a reliable field sampling of tree deaths across the entire range of forests affected by Katrina. They found that some forests were heavily damaged while others like the cypress-tupelo swamp forests fared remarkably well.The NASA-built Landsat 5, part of the Landsat series of Earth-observing satellites, takes detailed images of the Earth's surface.  Chambers combined results from the Landsat image sampling with data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer instrument on NASA's Terra satellite to estimate the size of the entire forested area affected by Katrina. The instrument can detect minute changes in the color spectrum on the land below, enabling it to measure differences in the percentage of live and dead vegetation. This helps researchers improve their estimates of changes in carbon storage and improves their ability to track the location of carbon sinks and sources.The field samples and satellite images, along with results from computer models that simulate the kind of vegetation and other traits that make up the forests, were used to measure the total tree loss the hurricane inflicted.  The scientists then calculated total carbon losses to be equivalent to 60-100 percent of the net annual carbon sink in U.S. forest trees.\"It is surprising to learn that one extreme event can release nearly as much carbon to the atmosphere as all U.S. forests can store in an average year,\" said Diane Wickland, manager of the Terrestrial Ecology Program at NASA Headquarters in Washington.  \"Satellite data enabled Chambers' research team to pin down the extent of tree damage so that we now know how these kinds of severe storms affect the carbon cycle and our atmosphere.  Satellite technology has really proven its worth in helping researchers like Chambers assess important changes in our planet's carbon cycle.\" The team's findings were published Nov. 15 in the journal Science."}

Over 500,000 people were evacuated, and nearly 90,000 square miles were declared a disaster area (roughly equal to the land mass of the United Kingdom). Although occurring over two years ago, infrastructure reconstruction efforts continue to lag, raising concerns about long-term mental health effects. The Hurricane Katrina Community Advisory Group initiative was launched to provide an ongoing tracking survey of those effects. The data are designed to help support public health decisions. The survey data presented in the report released today come from a follow-up survey from an original sample of 1,043 people who agreed to join the survey panel and to participate in repeated surveys over several years.  The fact that hurricane-related stressors were still quite common in the population nearly two years after the hurricane, and that much of this could be attributed to these continuing stresses suggests that efforts to address the problem of increased mental illness and suicidality among Hurricane Katrina victims must confront continuing needs for practical and logistical assistance. This may be particularly challenging since many pre-hurricane residents of the affected areas are now living elsewhere in the country. Still, it is especially important to reach these geographically displaced people because of their comparatively high risk of serious mental illness.The study is led by researchers from Harvard Medical School and is funded by the National Institute of Mental Health, FEMA, and the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services for Planning and Evaluation.The detailed results of this report are in press in the journal Molecular Psychiatry."}

These \"partner communities\" will help develop and share essential knowledge, best practices, tools and techniques to strengthen a community's ability to withstand a major disaster event with minimal downtime to basic government and business services, said CARRI director Warren Edwards.  \"We will be seeking insights from the experiences of the Gulfport, Memphis and Charleston communities to construct what we are calling our 'resiliency toolbox,' \" Edwards said. \"We hope to identify what the partner communities need to be truly resilient; use that information to assess vulnerabilities in other communities; and work with them to help them close the gaps.  \"A resilient community is prepared to help prevent or minimize the loss or damage to life, property and the environment and more quickly return citizens to work, reopen businesses, and restore essential services needed for a full and swift economic recovery.\"  Edwards said the three cities were approached about becoming the first communities for the project because they are susceptible to both natural and man-made disasters.  \"Memphis is particularly vulnerable to earthquakes because of its proximity to the New Madrid fault line,\" Edwards said. \"And, of course, Gulfport is currently in the process of recovering from Hurricane Katrina with a strong commitment to becoming an even more resilient community in the event of future storms. Charleston has significant hurricane and earthquake threats. Having made great strides in resilience planning, the city has lessons to share.\"  CARRI also may provide clues to potential community response to climate change. Tom Wilbanks, ORNL Corporate Fellow and research director for CARRI, said global warming could potentially affect world weather and precipitation patterns. Government leaders are beginning to look at climate change as a national security issue and examining its impacts on ecosystems and economies.  \"While the immediate purpose of the study is to examine communities' resilience to storms, this work has definite implications for climate change and will give us a better understanding of how cities will respond to the expected shifts in temperature, weather patterns and environmental conditions we expect as a result,\" Wilbanks said.  Edwards said CARRI could help communities move beyond their reliance on government and first responders and draw on business, education, and civic resources to prepare, plan and respond as efficiently and quickly as possible in the event of a disaster. CARRI will have access to national and international researchers and practitioners who can augment the findings from the community activities with the best information and practices available.  \"All of our partner communities are already doing some great work, so we look forward to working closely with key leaders in those communities to learn from what they are doing well, to help them locate and address any gaps, and to then formalize and develop some new best practices that can be shared and used by other communities.\"  CARRI is part of the Southeast Region Research Initiative (SERRI).

In the last three decades, more than 37 million people, 19 million homes, and countless businesses have been added to coastal areas. These areas are under severe stress owing to increased human activities and climate change.With the rapid development of computer technology, significant advances in modeling storm surges and surface waves have been made in coastal engineering over the last decade. The simulation and prediction of storm surges and waves are intrinsically complex.In the study, the advanced surge model (ADCIRC), coupled with the wave model (SWAN), was used to construct the prediction and effects of Hurricane Georges on the Mobile Bay estuary in 1998. Agreement between the model and data of the poststorm survey was found, demonstrating the effectiveness of the wave and surge prediction on coastal roadways around shallow estuaries. The coupled wave and surge modeling system has also been used to simulate the storm surge and wind waves during Hurricane Katrina that caused the collapse of several coastal bridges."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_616", "content": "Researchers can now investigate with greater accuracy how the rate of lightning strikes produced within a hurricane's eyewall is tied to the changing strength of that hurricane. A hurricane's eyewall is the inner heat-driven region of the storm that surrounds the \"eye\" where the most intense rainfall and most powerful winds occur. By monitoring the intensity of lightning near a hurricane's eye, scientists will be able to improve their forecasts of when a storm will unleash its harshest conditions.During the study, researchers used data from a growing network of new, long-range, ground-based lightning sensors, a NASA satellite and aircraft-based sensors. They explored the relationship between eyewall lightning outbreaks and the intensity of two of the most severe Atlantic storms on record before they made U.S. landfall: category five hurricanes Katrina and Rita. An article on this research, also supported by the U.S. Office of Naval Research, will be published in the American Meteorological Society's Monthly Weather Review later this year. \"There are very few observing systems that offer a broad view of a storm over the open ocean where hurricanes tend to build or lose strength,\" said lead author Kirt Squires, a recent graduate of the meteorology program at the University of Hawaii in Honolulu. \"What's really compelling about the new sensors is their increased sensitivity to pick up lightning's electromagnetic signal over water from such a long distance. As a result, we can see thunderstorm activity over the ocean from thousands of miles away for the first time. This development is essential to improving the way meteorologists can look at a growing storm to judge just how harsh it will be.\"When water condenses from vapor into a cloud droplet, latent or hidden heat is released, which in turn builds updrafts -- air moving upwards in a cloud. Latent heat provides the energy that fuels hurricanes. If the ensuing updrafts are strong enough, they can cause the separation of charge that produces lightning. The tight correlation between the rate of lightning strikes, the amount of rainfall and the heat released in the eyewall of a storm allows the lightning rate data to be useful in computer models that forecast hurricane track and intensity.\"Hurricane forecasters and researchers are very interested in developing methods that allow a continuous examination of the structural growth of the eyewall within hurricanes,\" said co-author Steven Businger, a senior professor of meteorology at the University of Hawaii. \"The fact that lightning is directly linked to the heat energy released in the eyewall makes it a priority for us to examine the evolution of lightning within a storm.\"Researchers studied data on intensity and lightning strike rate from hurricanes Katrina and Rita, both from 2005. They were trying to determine whether a link existed between the two traits. The researchers combined data from NASA's Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission satellite's microwave radiometers and from sensors onboard the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's P-3 \"hurricane hunter\" aircraft that fly into the storm, with the enhanced sensor capability of the NASA co-funded Pacific Lightning Detection Network.The network comprises four state-of-the-art, long-range, high-sensitivity sensors located around the central northern Pacific Ocean. Businger is working with the U.S. division of Finnish technology firm Vaisala, Tucson, Ariz., and other agencies to expand the network with eight additional sensor sites by the end of 2008. It is part of the larger North American Lightning Detection Network of nearly 200 sensors that monitors lightning over the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Though Businger acknowledges that more research is needed, results from this study show that the growth and density of lightning strikes in a hurricane's eyewall provide important insight into the inner workings of the most powerful storms on Earth, information that may in the future help save lives through improved hurricane forecasts."}

In September, the forecast calls for four of the five storms to become hurricanes and two to become major hurricanes. In October-November, the team forecasts two of the five named storms to become hurricanes and one to become a major hurricane.\"We expect the remainder of the season to be active,\" said Phil Klotzbach, lead author of the hurricane forecast. \"The conditions in the Pacific are transitioning to a weak La Nina.Â Â We have seen low pressure readings in the tropical Atlantic during August. The combination of these two factors usually implies an active season.\"\"We predict that September-November will exhibit characteristics of an active year based on climate signals through August,\" said William Gray, who has been issuing hurricane forecasts at Colorado State for 24 years.These conditions include Atlantic basin sea surface temperatures that have remained at near-normal values along with ENSO conditions that trended slightly cooler during August. Atlantic sea level pressure values were at near-record low levels during August.Â Â June-July 2007 had average activity with two named storms forming during the two-month period (Barry and Chantal). No activity occurred in the deep tropics during June and July.August had about average numbers of tropical cyclone formations.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 935 millibars.Scientists now have the ability to see what a hurricane looks like sideways, thanks to NASA's CloudSat Satellite. CloudSat's Cloud Profiling Radar captured these profiles of Hurricane Dean on August 17 and August 19 as he was heading toward the Yucatan.Dean is moving west-northwest near 20 mph (32 km/hr) and is expected to move on a west-northwestward to westward motion through Tuesday and Tuesday night.Â  On the forecast track, Dean's center will reach the southern Bay of Campeche late Tuesday afternoon and still remain a hurricane.A hurricane watch is in effect for the Gulf coast of Mexico from north of Veracruz to Tampico. A hurricane watch means that hurricane conditions are possible within the watch area, generally within 36 hours. Interests elsewhere in the southern Gulf of Mexico should closely monitor the progress of Dean.The National Hurricane Center noted in its 8:00 a.m. EDT report, \"Storm surge flooding and waves will gradually diminish along the east coast of the Yucatan Peninsula today.  Within the hurricane warning area in the Bay of Campeche, storm surge flooding of 6 to 8 feet above normal tide levels is possible, along with large and dangerous battering waves.\"Dean is expected to produce storm total rainfall of 5 to 10 inches over the Isthmus of Tehuantepec and Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico, Belize, Guatemala, and northern Honduras with maximum amounts of up to 20 inches.  These rains could cause life-threatening flash floods and mud slides."}

Knowing the strength and path of hurricanes is critical for issuing timely warnings; satellites are the best means of providing data on the forces that power the storm, such as cloud structure, wind and wave fields, sea surface temperature and sea surface height.Instruments aboard ESAâs Envisat and ERS-2 satellites allow them to peer through hurricanes. Envisat carries both optical and radar instruments, enabling researchers to observe high-atmosphere cloud structure and pressure in the visible and infrared spectrum. The Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) optical instrument shows the swirling cloud-tops of a hurricane, while radar instruments such as the Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ASAR) pierce through the clouds to show how the wind fields shape the sea surface and estimate their likely destructive extent. ERS-2 uses its radar scatterometer to observe the hurricane's underlying wind fields. The scatterometer instrument works by firing a trio of high-frequency radar beams down to the ocean, then analysing the pattern of backscatter reflected up again. Wind-driven ripples on the ocean surface modify the radar backscatter, and as the energy in these ripples increases with wind velocity, backscatter increases as well. Scatterometer results enable measurements not only of wind speed but also of direction across the water surface.  What makes ERS-2's scatterometer especially valuable is that its C-band radar frequency is almost unaffected by heavy rain, so it can return useful wind data even from the heart of the fiercest storms. Dr Ad Stoffelen of the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute (KNMI), which processes ESAâs scatterometer images, said: \"Observed winds from hurricane Dean by ESA's ERS-2 scatterometer are provided to meteorologists within the hour. This C-band radar wavelength scatterometer peeks right into the âeyeâ of a hurricane like Dean, providing timely and precise information on its position and force.\"The wind field derived from the ESA ERS-2 scatterometer measurements are distributed via a EUMETSAT (European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites) project to a registered database of a few hundred users, originating from all over the world, includng the Americas, Australia, Asia and Europe. Scatterometer winds are used directly by shift meteorologists in forecast rooms and to initialise Numerical Weather Prediction models aiding the forecasting of hurricanes 5 days ahead.\" Another Envisat instrument called the Radar Altimeter-2 (RA-2) uses radar pulses to measure sea surface height (SSH) down to an accuracy of a few centimetres. Near-real time radar altimetry is a powerful tool for monitoring a hurricane's progress and predicting its potential impact because anomalies in SSH can be used to identify warmer ocean features such as warm core rings, eddies and currents. Water temperatures are the main underlying energy reservoir that power hurricanes; together with the correct atmospheric conditions, temperatures need to exceed 26ÂºC in order to form and maintain a tropical cyclone. Because warm water expands, scientists can locate warm underwater ocean features by detecting bulges in the ocean surface height, as detected by RA-2. The thermal energy of warm water, which partly powers a hurricane, is known as tropical cyclone heat potential (TCHP). Warm waters may extend to at least 100 metres beneath the surface in many of these oceanic features, representing waters of very high heat content. Several hurricanes have intensified when their tracks pass over eddies or other masses of warm water with high TCHP values. The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is using Envisat RA-2 results along with those from other space-borne altimeters to chart TCHP and improve the accuracy of hurricane forecasting.  Envisat's Advanced Along Track Scanning Radiometer (AATSR) works like a space-based thermometer, acquiring the temperature of the sea surface down to a fraction of a degree. It also returns useful atmospheric data, measuring the temperature of the top of hurricane clouds â the higher into the atmosphere they extend, the colder they are.AATSR information can be correlated with MERIS data cloud height and development to gain a good estimate of the hurricane's precipitation potential, and improve understanding of how this relates to its overall intensity. Condensation of water vapour releases latent heat, which warms the vicinity of the hurricane eye. This in turn evaporates more surface water and feeds the heat engine powering the hurricane. The International Charter 'Space and Major Disasters' has been activated to provide Earth Observation satellite data for assessing the damage of Hurricane Dean in Belize."}

The first period, between 1900 and 1930, saw an average of six Atlantic tropical cyclones (or major storms), of which four were hurricanes and two were tropical storms. From 1930 to 1940, the annual average increased to 10, consisting of five hurricanes and five tropical storms. In the final study period, from 1995 to 2005, the average reached 15, of which eight were hurricanes and seven were tropical storms.This latter period has not yet stabilized, which means that the average hurricane season may be more active in the future. Holland and Webster caution, however, that it is not possible at this time to predict the level at which the frequency and intensity of storms will stabilize.The increases over the last century correlate closely with SSTs, which have risen by about 1.3 degrees Fahrenheit in the last 100 years. The changes in SSTs took place in the years prior to the sharp increases in storm frequency, with an SST rise of approximately 0.7 degrees Fahrenheit leading up to 1930 and a similar rise leading up to 1995 and continuing even after. The authors note that other studies indicate that most of the rise in Atlantic SSTs can be attributed to global warming.The unusually active hurricane seasons of 2004 and 2005 have spurred considerable research into the question of whether more intense tropical cyclones are correlated with natural cycles, global warming, or some other cause. The new study indicates that natural cycles are probably not the entire cause because the increase has happened across the last century rather than oscillating in tandem with a natural cycle. The study also finds that enhanced observations in recent decades cannot account for all of the increase. To observe storms in the Atlantic more systematically, meteorologists began relying on data from aircraft flights in 1944 and satellites about 1970. The distinct transitions in hurricane activity noted by Holland and Webster occurred around both 1930 and 1995.\"We are of the strong and considered opinion that data errors alone cannot explain the sharp, high-amplitude transitions between the climatic regimes, each with an increase of around 50 percent in cyclone and hurricane numbers, and their close relationship with SSTs,\" the authors state.While the number of storms has steadily increased, the proportion of hurricanes to all Atlantic tropical cyclones has remained steady. Hurricanes have generally accounted for roughly 55 percent of all tropical cyclones. However, the proportion of major hurricanes (those with maximum sustained winds of at least 110 miles per hour) to less intense hurricanes and tropical storms has oscillated irregularly, and has increased significantly in recent years.The 2006 hurricane season was far less active than the two preceding years, in part because of the emergence of an El Nino event in the Pacific Ocean. However, that year, which was not included in the study, would have ranked above average a century ago, with five hurricanes and four other named storms.\"Even a quiet year by today's standards would be considered normal or slightly active compared to an average year in the early part of the 20th century,\" Holland says.The University Corporation for Atmospheric Research manages the National Center for Atmospheric Research under primary sponsorship by the National Science Foundation.

{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_622", "content": "The survey was conducted in eight states--Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina and Texas--and only included residents of counties within 20 miles of the coast. The poll included a special sample of the New Orleans metropolitan area. The top reasons people give for not evacuating involve issues of safety and security. Three-quarters (75%) say their home is well-built and they would be safe there. Over half (56%) feel that roads would be too crowded, and slightly more than one in three (36%) feels that evacuating would be dangerous. One-third (33%) worry that their possessions would be stolen or damaged while one in four (27%) say they would not evacuate because they do not want to leave their pets.\"Public officials need to be concerned that the further we get from the severe hurricanes of 2005, the less willing people are to evacuate,\" said Robert J. Blendon, Professor of Health Policy and Political Analysis at the Harvard School of Public Health. \"Officials need to remind people that many homes are vulnerable to major storms. They also need to ensure safe evacuation routes are available and the public is aware of them.\"These findings are based on interviews conducted June 18 - July 10, 2007 with 5,046 adults in high hurricane risk counties in eight states.Â  If residents of high-risk hurricane areas have to evacuate because of a major hurricane, most would be concerned about the conditions of evacuation shelters if they had to go to one. The biggest worries people have are that shelters would be unsanitary (68%), there wouldn't be enough clean water to drink (66%), the shelter would be too crowded (65%), they would be exposed to sick people (62%), and medical care would be lacking (58%).Many residents of hurricane-prone areas have not made critical preparations for a major storm. If running water were cut off due to a hurricane, one in four (23%) would run out of clean water after two days, and over half (54%) would run out after six days. If power were shut off, one in ten (9%) would be without food after two days, and nearly half (44%) after six days. Hurricane Katrina showed that families can get separated and communication can break down in the aftermath of a major storm, but most residents have not prepared for that possibility. Two in three (66%) have not agreed on a meeting place if their family is separated, and one in two (49%) have not agreed on a phone number outside the region that family members could call. Of those who intend to evacuate and need help to do so (13%), half (50%) do not have that help lined up.Past experience with hurricanes has identified some critical information that people should know in order to be prepared for a storm. Many residents of high-risk areas were unaware of some key information. One out of three (34%) do not know if their home is located in an evacuation zone. Thirty-nine percent do not know the location of an evacuation center in their community where they could go if they had to. A large majority of people would be at risk of eating food that has spoiled due to a loss of refrigeration in a power outage. The USDA recommends that perishable food should not be eaten if refrigeration has been turned off for four hours. Only one in five (20%) knew that perishable food would be safe for just a few hours. One in three (36%) said that food is safe for up to one day, one in four (25%) said two days, and 16% said three or more days. In addition, one in five did not know that each household member requires at least one gallon of clean water per day, the amount recommended by the CDC.Nearly one-half (46%) of the respondents in the survey live in communities that were damaged by a hurricane during the past three years. The survey asked them about the problems they had during these hurricanes in order to identify issues that could be prevented in future hurricanes. The most common problem was getting gas to evacuate (35%). Twenty percent reported they did not have enough money at some point, 14% did not have enough water and 12% did not have enough food. Of note, smaller numbers reported needing medical care but not getting it (5%), getting injured (5%) or being threatened by violence (3%). One area where few people reported problems was getting the information they needed to keep themselves and their families safe (8%). The survey included a sample of the New Orleans metropolitan area to see if residents there differed from other high-risk area residents. After their experiences during Hurricane Katrina, most New Orleans residents say they would evacuate for a future storm. Only 14% would not evacuate compared to 32% of residents of other high-risk areas. Six in ten (61%) do not know the location of an evacuation shelter if they needed to go to one, which is significantly more than residents of other areas (38%). Despite the dramatic images of people stranded during Katrina, over half (54%) of New Orleans residents are confident they would be rescued if they needed to be during a future storm.\"It is worrisome that New Orleans, the site of one of the most severe hurricanes in U.S. history, has such a large proportion of people who don't know the location of an evacuation center,\" said Professor Blendon. \"An important priority for government and voluntary agencies should be to inform people of the location of shelters well before a storm hits.\"Even after Katrina, a substantial percentage of New Orleans residents are not prepared for a major storm. One-half of New Orleans residents (51%) have not agreed on a place for family to meet if they get separated. Thirty-nine percent have not agreed on a phone number outside the region that family members could call. A sizable percentage of New Orleans residents (23%) do not have more than two days of water if the water supply were cut off. When asked to rate the response of government and voluntary agencies to the problems created by the last major hurricane, 78% percent of New Orleans residents said it was fair or poor compared to 39% of residents of other areas damaged by a hurricane. Only 19% of New Orleans residents said the response was excellent or good compared to 57% in other areas. Hurricane Katrina illustrated the additional challenges facing minorities and the poor in these high-risk coastal areas during a major hurricane. This survey finds that although African-Americans (73%) and Latino-Americans (71%) are more likely than whites (59%) to say they would evacuate if government officials said they had to leave in the event of a major hurricane, they are also more likely to need help to do so. Seventeen percent of African-Americans and 10% of Latino-Americans say they need help to evacuate and do not have that help lined up compared to 3% of whites (Figure 7). Low-income residents also would have more problems evacuating than those who are better off financially. Eighteen percent of those making less than $25,000 a year and who intend to evacuate do not have the necessary help compared to 4% of those making $25,000 a year or more. If minorities and low-income residents are unable to evacuate because they do not have help, they are less prepared to stay in their homes and weather the storm and its aftermath. Approximately one-third of African-Americans (32%), Latino-Americans (35%) and low-income residents (33%) say they are not prepared if a major hurricane were to strike their community in the next six months. This compares to 14% of whites and 19% of those making $25,000 a year or more. A greater percentage of African-Americans (18%), Latino-Americans (11%) and low-income residents (14%) do not have enough food on hand to last more than three days compared to whites (6%) and those making $25,000 a year or more (8%). This is the 25th in a series of studies by the Harvard School of Public Health Project on the Public and Biological Security. The study was designed and analyzed by researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health (HSPH). The project director is Robert J. Blendon of the Harvard School of Public Health. The research team also includes Tami Buhr, John M. Benson, and Kathleen J. Weldon of the Harvard School of Public Health, and Melissa J. Herrmann of ICR/International Communications Research. Fieldwork was conducted via telephone for the Project by ICR/International Communications Research of Media (PA) between June 18 and July 10, 2007. The survey was conducted with a representative sample of 5,046 non-institutionalized adults ages 18 and over in high hurricane risk counties in eight states. Survey participants included residents of all counties within 20 miles of the coast in Alabama (503 interviews), Florida (1,006), Georgia (506), Louisiana (1,004), Mississippi (513), North Carolina (504), South Carolina (507), and Texas (503). The survey included 502 residents of the New Orleans metropolitan area, where interviews were conducted with adults from cellphone-only households, as well from households with landline telephones. The results were weighted to represent the total adult population in the high hurricane risk counties of the region as a whole. The margin of error for the total sample is plus or minus 2.6 percentage points; for the New Orleans-area sample, plus or minus 4.7 percentage points.Possible sources of nonsampling error include nonresponse bias, as well as question wording and ordering effects. Nonresponse in telephone surveys produces some known biases in survey-derived estimates because participation tends to vary for different subgroups of the population. To compensate for these known biases, sample data are weighted to the most recent Census data available from the Current Population Survey for gender, age, race, education, as well as number of adults in the household. Other techniques, including random-digit dialing, replicate subsamples, callbacks staggered over times of day and days of the week, and systematic respondent selection within households, are used to ensure that the sample is representative.

{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_623", "content": "Researchers charting the growth of vines in two forests in South Carolina found up to a 10-fold increase in the number of vines in just two decades. Vines commonly found in both forests include grapevines, trumpet vine, poison ivy and Virginia creeper. Most of the vines use adhesive roots or tendrils to climb trees.The patterns observed in the south add to a growing number of studies that found similar patterns in temperate and tropical forests, said Bruce Allen, the study's lead author and a recent doctoral graduate of Ohio State University's School of Environment and Natural Resources.âCollectively, we're talking about an increase of more than 500 vine stems in 27 acres of forest area that we studied,â he said. âAnd all of the growth is within the last 10 to 20 years. Old photographs from the sites indicate there may have been fewer vines historically.âThere are now so many vines that they're starting to change the makeup of the forest,â he continued. âIt appears that as the number of vines increase, the density of small trees decreases at a fairly uniform rate.âAlthough the specific reasons for this shift aren't fully understood, Allen and his colleagues say possible mechanisms include increases in carbon dioxide concentrations, which have been shown to increase vine growth more than tree growth.âMany vines thrive on elevated levels of carbon dioxide,â he said. âSeveral studies suggest that vines like poison ivy benefit more than other plants from higher COThe findings appear in a recent issue of the journal Forest Ecology and Management. Allen conducted the study with P. Charles Goebel, an associate professor of environment and natural resources at Ohio State, and with Rebecca Sharitz, a senior research ecologist at the University of Georgia 's Savannah River Ecology Laboratory in Aiken, S.C.The researchers collected 12 years' worth of data from six plots that each covered 2.5 acres â that's about the size of a football field â in an old-growth forest in South Carolina's Congaree National Park. They surveyed the plots every four years, beginning in late 1989. That was the same year that Hurricane Hugo struck the southeastern United States, killing an estimated 20 percent of the forest's trees.The researchers also surveyed five 2.5-acre plots in a second-growth forest â a forest that was partially logged about 100 years ago and has grown back â along the Savannah River and a major tributary, Upper Three Runs Creek. The Savannah River creates a natural border between South Carolina and Georgia.The researchers gathered data on vine growth in this protected forest every six to 10 years, beginning in 1979.Allen said that he wanted to see if there was any difference in vine density between the old growth and newer forest.During each survey session researchers would count the number of vine stems in each plot, identify new and dead stems, and look at vine growth from previous surveys.Vine density in the old-growth, Congaree forest nearly doubled within 12 years. Right after Hurricane Hugo, there were about 100 vines in each plot. By 2002, that average had increased to slightly more than 200 vines per plot. While the second-growth, Savannah River forest had fewer vines by the end of the study, the researchers calculated a 10-fold increase in the number of vines in this forest -- they counted an average of 10 vines per plot by the end of the study in the Savannah River forest. In 1979, researchers had found just one vine in all of the research plots.The five-fold difference in vine density between the two forests suggests that second-growth forests may be at more risk to threatening vine growth. Researchers wonder whether the steadily increasing growth in these forests will continue in the coming years. Unpublished data on vine growth in these forests gathered during the last four years suggests that this growth will continue. If it does, that could have an economic effect on the people who manage floodplain forests for timber.âAlthough there was a substantial difference in the number of vines in each forest, the increase in density at the Savannah River site represents a linear increase in the number of vines,â Allen said. âWe would expect vine density to increase after a disturbance, such as a hurricane.âBut to see such a clear, definitive increase at the undisturbed site along the Savannah River was unexpected, based on current models of floodplain forest development.âA few years ago, Allen and his colleagues published a study suggesting that increased vine growth equates to a decrease in tree growth.As the number of vines increase, their leaves fill a forest's canopy and essentially reduce the amount of sunlight that reaches the forest floor. Some of the competing plants die because they can't get enough light.âThe likely result is that more vines will grow on existing trees, and compete directly with tree seedlings,â Allen said. âA steady increase in vine numbers will likely influence the kind of trees that ultimately grow in these forests.âStill, Allen says it would take many lifetimes to completely change the look of the forests.âBoth study sites lie in a floodplain and are often in the path of hurricane-force winds, so their landscape can change rapidly,â Allen said. âData we've gathered from the Congaree forest shows a reduction in vine density after a hurricane. The winds wipe out many of the trees on which vines grow, thereby letting more light into the forest and also triggering a short-term increase in tree growth beneath the canopy.âThis work received support from several agencies, including the National Park Service, the U.S. Department of Energy, the Ohio Agricultural Research and Development Center, Ohio State and the Savannah River Ecology Laboratory."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_624", "content": "The next generation of hurricane models is being developed by URI Professor Isaac Ginis, in collaboration with scientists at the NOAA Centers for Environmental Prediction, to replace an earlier version used by the National Hurricane Center since 1995.âThe new Hurricane Weather and Research Forecasting model will incorporate satellite data, as well as temperature data collected from instruments dropped from aircraft into the water at the eye of the storm, to create the first hurricane model that consolidates information from the air, sea and land,â said Ginis. âThis new model has improved physics and numerics, allowing us to do a much better job of simulating the hurricane core at much higher resolution, which results in better forecasts.âWhile the accuracy of forecasting the path of a hurricane has improved dramatically over the years, little improvement has been made in accurately predicting hurricane intensity, according to Ginis. The new model is expected to greatly improve hurricane intensity predictions, while also becoming the first model to predict the storm surge and inland flooding associated with hurricanes.Ginis began work on the new model in 2006 and was recently awarded two grants from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to complete work on it and make it operational for the 2008 hurricane season.The URI researcher also received a grant from the U.S. Navy to adapt his original model, which was developed exclusively for use in the Atlantic Ocean, Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico, to forecast typhoons in the Pacific Ocean.âThe atmosphere is the same over the Pacific,â noted Ginis, âbut the ocean is very different. It has different temperatures, geography and coastlines, so Iâll be incorporating a wide range of data specific to the Pacific region into the model for the Navyâs use.âThe Korean Oceanographic Research Institute has also awarded Ginis a grant to adapt his model to the particular conditions of the Korean peninsula. A typhoon in 2001 devastated two major ports in Korea, and the government believes that better storm forecasts would have allowed the ports to be better prepared. Ginis said that the governments of Japan and Taiwan may also be interested in working with him to improve typhoon forecasts in the region.âThe major challenge in the Pacific is to better understand the ocean dynamics there,â Ginis explained. âWe need a great deal more data from the Pacific region, particularly observational data that is already available for the Atlantic but that hasnât been collected in the Pacific.âKorean researchers will be collecting most of the necessary data.As for the 2007 Atlantic hurricane season, Ginis believes that the Eastern Seaboard may be at greater risk for a hurricane this year.âWe just finished an El Nino period, which results in fewer storms, but now weâre transitioning to La Nina, which favors storm development,â he said. âWeâre overdue here in New England for a big storm. Category 3 storms strike our region about every 60 years, and the last one was Carol in 1954.â"}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_625", "content": "The findings appear in the report âMeasuring the Impacts of Climate Change on North Carolina Coastal Resources,â which assesses the impact of rising sea levels on property values, recreation and quality of life, and was conducted by researchers from Appalachian State University, East Carolina University, University of North Carolina Wilmington and the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research. The study finds that:The study surveyed the counties of New Hanover, Dare, Carteret and Bertie. These four counties represent a cross-section of the North Carolina coastline in geographical distribution and economic development, according to the study. Researchers found that North Carolinaâs coast is highly vulnerable to climate change, and looked at the economic impact global warming could have on its resources. They also considered how sea level rise would affect damage to property values, coastal recreation and tourism. According to current research, sea levels globally are expected to rise significantly during the next century. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimates that changes in the earthâs climate could raise global sea levels by one to more than two feet over the next 25 to 75 years. The researchers used the IPCC projections, along with county tax, recreation and travel, and fishing data to determine their findings.John Whitehead, a professor of economics at Appalachian State University, was lead author. Other contributors were Okmyung âPaulâ Bin from East Carolina Universityâs Department of Economics and Chris Dumas from the Department of Economics and Finance at UNC Wilmington. Ben Poulter, formerly of Duke Universityâs Nicholas School of the Environment and Earth Sciences and now with the Department of Global Change and Natural Systems at Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany, assisted with computer modeling of the non-economic data used to generate the report. Whitehead looked at the impact that loss of beach width would have on fishing and recreational trips.  âAnglers who like to catch saltwater fish but donât own boats or have enough money for a charter boat rental have two options: They can fish off a pier or fish from the beach,â Whitehead said. âIf the beach disappears, anglers can switch to the piers, which may become crowded and less enjoyable. People traveling to the beach for recreation wonât have a similar option.â By the year 2080, 14 of the 17 recreational swimming beaches in southern North Carolina could, without adaptation, erode all the way to the road, eliminating the possibility for beach recreation in those areas.As the beach diminishes, Whitehead said, people would spend less time and money at the coast as a result of the lost recreational opportunities. Using economic models, he estimated the lost economic value for southern North Carolina beaches would total $3.9 billion over the next 75 years. ECUâs Okmyung âPaulâ Bin looked at the impact of sea level rise on property value. He found that losses of $6.9 billion could occur in just four North Carolina coastal counties during the next 75 years, without adaptation, with the most significant losses occurring in the vulnerable northern coastal counties.âThe amount of developed property along the North Carolina coastline has steadily increased over the last several decades due to a strong preference for coastal locations,â Bin said. âThe number of building permits in Carolina Beach during the last four years alone exceeds the number of permits issued over the previous 20 years, and the average selling price for residential properties in Wrightsville Beach has increased more than 200 percent since 2001. This growth, coupled with soaring property values in North Carolina, has created greater vulnerability to rising sea levels.âDepending on the sea level rise scenarios over the next 75 years, Bin found that the residential property value at risk in Dare County could range from $242 million to $2.7 billion, and the property value at risk in Carteret County would be between $26 million and $291 million. More protected New Hanover and Bertie counties would likely have smaller impacts. New Hanover County could have residential property value at risk between $37 million and $212 million, and Bertie Countyâs risk could range from $2 million to $7 million in property value. âThese estimates focus on the loss of property value from permanent inundation,â Bin said. âTemporary inundation caused by high tides and storms occurs much sooner in time than permanent flooding, and the costs associated with it can be quite large relative to those associated with permanent flooding.âIncreased storm severity would also impact the agriculture, forestry, commercial fisheries and general business sectors in these counties. UNC Wilmington economist Chris Dumas estimated that business interruption losses in New Hanover, Dare, Carteret and Bertie counties associated with an increase in Category 3 hurricanes would rise by $34 million per storm event by 2030, and by $157 million per storm event by 2080. Even if there were no increases in hurricane frequency through 2080, cumulative losses in the four counties could still exceed $1.4 billion when regional economic growth is considered. âBusiness interruption losses could be even larger if storm frequency increases, whether or not storm severity intensifies,â Dumas said. âAlthough current climate models could not predict storm frequency changes, if climate change were to cause an increase in storm frequency, we would expect more frequent flooding, evacuations, downed power lines â and larger economic impacts.âIn addition to business interruption, increasing storm intensity would also have serious impacts on agriculture and forestry. Agricultural damage from hurricanes currently runs at about $50 million for a Category 1 hurricane, about $200 million for a Category 2 storm, and about $800 million for a Category 3. Any escalation of hurricane activity would significantly increase the amount of agricultural damage. Similarly, timber damage assessments indicate that an increase in hurricane severity from Category 2 to Category 3 can raise timber losses by about $900 million. Hurricane Fran, a Category 3 storm that made landfall in September 1996, damaged 44 percent of the commercial forest land along the northern coastal plan, an estimated $1.39 billion in lost timber. Although work is underway at the North Carolina Division of Marine Fisheries to assess the impacts of hurricanes on North Carolina fisheries, it is still a work in progress. Results from limited case studies indicate that commercial fisheries suffer economic losses primarily in the form of damaged fishing gear and reduction in the number of safe fishing days. In addition, populations of some fish species may fall following hurricanes, further reducing fishing profitability. Climate change would likely increase these losses if storm severity or frequency escalates. âCoastal North Carolina has been identified as one of the United States most vulnerable regions to climate change,â Poulter said. âMore than 2,000 square miles of North Carolinaâs coastal ecosystems and urban areas are below one-meter elevation and within the range of projected sea level rise from climate change for the year 2100. This study demonstrates that, as climate change contributes to inundation, increased shoreline erosion and higher hurricane intensity, coastal economies will experience significant economic losses in the absence of mitigation and local adaptation.âWhitehead hopes the study will be used by policy makers to better understand the benefits of implementing climate change policy. âUsually, decision makers focus on one of two things: the benefits of a policy or the costs of a policy,â Whitehead said. âRight now, it seems that people are focusing on the costs of addressing climate change. The benefits of implementing climate change policy would occur further down the road, which makes them easier to ignore or postpone. We hope this study will help fill in some of the gaps in knowledge about this issue.â"}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_626", "content": "The July Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology presents an update on the nephrology community's efforts to meet the unique needs of people with kidney disease in the aftermath of disaster. Drawing on the experience of nephrologists who responded to Hurricane Katrina, recent earthquakes in Asia, and other disasters, four articles in the special section draw on past lessons to inform future plans for responding to future crises. The articles are preceded by an introduction from Dr. Paul Kimmel, highlighting the role of the ASN and other professional organizations in planning the response to disasters. Dr. Jeffrey Kopp of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, National Institutes of Health, and coauthors analyze the lessons of two historic 2005 disasters: Hurricane Katrina and other storms that wreaked havoc along the U.S. Gulf Coast and the devastating earthquake in Kashmir, South Asia. After Katrina, 94 dialysis facilities in the region were closed for a week or longerâincluding more than one-third of all centers in the state of Louisiana. The best guess is that of over 5,800 Gulf Coast dialysis patients affected by Katrina, 2.5 percent died in the month after the stormâalthough given the high mortality rate among dialysis patients, it is difficult to determine how many deaths were storm-related. The Kashmir earthquake offered different lessons, especially in terms of the risk of acute renal failure (ARF). This is a special concern in earthquakes or other causes of building collapse, because muscle damage from crush injuries can cause a condition called rhabdomyolysis, which can rapidly lead to ARF. In response to these disasters, the Kidney Community Emergency Response Coalition (KCERC) was formed, with representatives from over 50 governmental and private organizations. A second article by Dr. Kopp and colleagues outlines the KCERC's plans for responding to future emergencies that interrupt dialysis services.The recommendations focus on establishing \"a timeline to safety\" for dialysis patients: \"If we accomplish specific tasks at each disaster stage, then it is likely that we can protect the health of these vulnerable patients,\" the authors conclude. They note that health care providers should \"create an individualized disaster plan for each patient, and review the plan regularly with each patient.\" The KERC's approach may also help to guide disaster preparedness planning for other vulnerable populations.Dr. Robert J. Kenney of Renal Associates of Baton Rouge, LLC, focuses on the need for every dialysis center to develop a specific disaster plan, addressing issues like communication, which was one of the most critical challenges after Katrina; electrical and water supplies; and special patient populations, such as evacuees and children. \"The lack of organization and miscommunication following Katrina prompted providers at all levels to ask just how prepared dialysis facilities are for future catastrophes,\" says Dr. Kenney. \"We hope to stimulate physicians, dialysis facilities, and staff to familiarize themselves with emergency preparedness concepts while noting specific resources where more specific information can be obtained.\" Dr. Masafumi Fukagawa of Kobe University offers insights from the viewpoint of a renal physician in Japan, where various types of natural disastersânot only earthquakes and typhoons, but volcanic eruptions and tsunamisâare a threat. Drawing on the experience of the Hanshin-Awaji Earthquake of 1995, Dr. Fukagawa emphasizes the need to reopen medical centers as soon as possible after a disaster. He also emphasizes the need for sharing experiences across generations, as people who haven't lived through them \"forget\" how severe such rare disasters can be. \"My hope is to summarize preparedness not only for usual degrees of earthquakes, but also for unexpectedly severe earthquakesâonce in a lifetime or in centuries,\" says Dr. Fukagawa.

Wind researchers at the Center for Building Science and Technology (CSTB) in France, researched and tested reduced-scale home models at its wind tunnel facilities, and developed a prototype of a \"cyclonic\" or hurricane-resistant dwelling. Taher cooperated with the CSTB wind researchers, working on the structural aspect of the home's design. That design eventually became an elevated structure of a square plan form on an open foundation. The home had a hip roof and was equipped with a central shaft with aerodynamic features designed to reduce wind forces during an extreme wind event. Wind tunnel tests at CSTB showed that such a home would be far more efficient under high winds and hurricane conditions than a typical structure. CSTB is working with a builder to construct a prototype of such a home on RÃ©union in the West Indian Ocean. From this work and other studies Taher recommends the following construction considerations for homeowners in hurricane-prone regions."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_628", "content": "An important ongoing avenue of investigation in the climate and meteorology research communities is to determine the relative roles of anthropogenic forcing (i.e., global warming) and natural variability in producing the observed recent increases in hurricane frequency in the Atlantic, as well as the reported increases of tropical cyclone activity measures in several other ocean basins. A survey of the existing literature shows that many types of data have been used to describe hurricane intensity, and not all records are of sufficient length to reliably identify historical trends. Additionally, there are concerns among researchers about possible effects of data inhomogeneities on the reported trends. Much of the current debate has focused on the relative roles of sea-surface temperatures or large-scale potential intensity versus the role of other environmental factors such as vertical wind shear in causing observed changes in hurricane statistics. Significantly more research â from observations, theory, and modeling â is needed to resolve the current debate around global warming and hurricanes."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_629", "content": "Now, researchers are learning how to predict where tropical storms and hurricanes will dump the most rain â even days after â and hundreds of miles away from â landfall.In a paper in the current issue of the journal Professional Geographer, Corene Matyas, an assistant professor of geography at the University of Florida, outlines new tools to predict how the stormâs intensity, distance it has moved inland and landscape topography alters its ârain shieldsâ â the bands of heavy rain so visible in Doppler radar images. Among other things, her tools proved adept at modeling observations that when hurricanes or tropical storms encounter the Texas hill country or the Appalachian Mountains, their rain shields tend to line up in the same direction and with the same orientation as the underlying topography. âThere are a lot of different things that can affect where the rainfall can occur in the storm and how heavy that rainfall will be,â Matyas said. âOur goal is to work toward predicting how those factors will determine the rainfall pattern.âHistorically, hurricanes have proven most fatal at landfall, with coastal residents overcome by storm surge and high winds. But over the past four decades, forecasters have become more skilled at predicting hurricanesâ tracks over open water, enabling most coastal residents to flee or prepare for the storms well in advance.As a result, the highest proportion of hurricane and tropical fatalities has shifted inland. One study cited in the Matyas paper found 59 percent of deaths from tropical storms or hurricanes between 1970 and 1999 occurred because of heavy rainfall rather than wind or storm surge. As storms track inland, they inevitably ensnare more cities and towns. In 1998, Tropical Depression Charley left 20 people dead near Del Rio, Texas, more than 200 miles from where the storm made landfall, Matyas notes.Researchers are developing some models for forecasting inland rain patterns, but they have difficulty accounting for the lopsided or elongated shape the pattern often takes, with most if not all rain falling on one side of the storm. A common assumption is that rainfall will decrease as the hurricane moves away from the ocean, which is generally true but may be obviated by other weather systems and local landscape. Matyasâ goal was to find new tools to improve the models.She studied radar data from 13 U.S. storms that made landfall between 1997 and 2003, then used a common tool in geography â geographical information systems, or GIS â to measure how rainfall patterns changed. GIS is a computer system that makes it possible to analyze spatial patterns of data. It is often used to track things such as voting patterns, but using GIS in meteorology â where spatial patterns change â is relatively new, Matyas said.Matyas outlined the edge of the rain shields using radar data, then measured their shapes by calculating characteristics such as the position of their center of mass. She repeated the analysis for each hour that the storms were over land. She then used a statistical technique, discriminant analysis, to determine which shape and size best place the storms into groups based on their intensity, how far they travel inland and the topography they encounter. The success of the discriminant analyses indicates that these shape measures could serve as predictive tools for future rainfall models.In a demonstration of the potential, the shape measures helped to confirm that that the orientation of stormsâ rain shields corresponds closely to the orientation of the land topography. With hurricanes crossing Texas hill country, the rain shields tend to line up parallel to the main axis of the hills, running west to east. Storms near the Appalachians also line up parallel to the mountains, whose axis runs southwest to northeast, with the heaviest rain consistently occurring to the west of the track. This is due to a combination of the mountains and a wedge of cold and dry continental air forcing the moist air upward, causing the water vapor to condense and fall to the ground as rain. This phenomenon does not happen with the Texas storms, as the dry continental air masses over Texas are similar in temperature to tropical moist air masses that accompany hurricanes.Frank Marks, a research meteorologist and director of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrationâs Hurricane Research Division, said Matyasâ conclusions âhave a lot of merit in terms of understanding the structure, size and shape of the rain shield.âHe said the next step is to add rainfall amount to the variables. The end goal: a model that will provide inland residents with the same targeted advance warnings and watches that coastal residents get today â but for heavy rainfall rather than wind or storm surge."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_630", "content": "The 84-page report, âThe New Orleans Hurricane Protection System: What Went Wrong and Why,â targets the public and policymakers, and complements and synthesizes the thousands of pages released so far by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers during their post-Katrina investigation.Dr. Robert Gilbert, the risk expert on the ASCE panel and a civil engineering professor at The University of Texas at Austin, noted that their risk analysis confirms the vulnerable nature of the cityâs hurricane protection system. In the report, the panel estimated that despite the levees and floodwalls, New Orleans residentsâ pre-Katrina risk was at a 1,000-fold higher rate than considered minimally acceptable for a major U.S. dam. âA thousand people died in New Orleans, and the system failed once in 40 years,â said the international risk assessment expert. âThatâs way off the chart of acceptable risk if you compare the system to major U.S. dams, which have governmental oversight and must meet federal safety guidelines.âÂ  Determining the factors that directly or indirectly led to this high risk was a major goal of the ASCE panel as an essential step to help the city make informed decisions about the future.âGiven the high risk, some very significant decisions need to be made about how New Orleans is going to be redeveloped and function in the future,â Gilbert said. âThe risk of flooding should influence everything from how people are evacuated to where and how houses are re-built and land is re-developed. Building houses on ground that is 5 to 10 feet below sea level and assuming they will never get wet is nonsensical.âThe U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is expected in June to release its assessment of the inherent risk of the 350-mile, New Orleansâ hurricane protection system. Â As part of assessing the risk and making recommendations for future improvements, the panel considered factors that included- how inconsistencies in the features of the levees and floodwalls â including their varying heights and construction from erodible materials â resulted from their piecemeal development and disjointed oversight, and how this fed into the failure at 50 locations along the system during Hurricane Katrina;- how the hurricane protection system was under-designed to handle a major storm surge produced by hurricane winds that would reach New Orleans. No one had ever estimated the height of the surge likely to reach different points of the levee system using the standard benchmark â a major hurricane that would hit an average of every 100 years. Despite the importance of engineering improvements, Gilbert cautioned that fortification steps alone arenât enough.âIt isnât just about improving the reliability of the levees and making them taller,â he said. âSpending federal money towards developing a way to evacuate people effectively is crucial, and very little emphasis has been put on this or on determining how to rebuild the city in a way that will keep people and property safe.âRelying only on levees isnât the answer, Gilbert said, because upgrading them is expensive, and itâs difficult to anticipate the magnitude of future storms, which can impact a small portion of a levee system and have catastrophic consequences. He also noted that higher levees can create greater danger because of the higher wall of water that is released if they fail.Â âIâm hopeful that getting this report out into the public forum about all these challenges will help motivate the people involved in making tough decisions about the future of New Orleans to start doing so.â"}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_631", "content": "These findings support a 2001 theory by Kerry Emanuel, a professor of atmospheric science at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and suggest that there is an additional factor to be included in climate models that may change predictions of future climate scenarios.\"It was thought that hurricanes occurred over too short of a time period and over too small of an area to affect the global system,\" said Matthew Huber, the Purdue University professor of earth and atmospheric sciences who led the research group. \"This research provides evidence that hurricanes play an important role and may be one of the missing pieces in the climate modeling puzzle.\"The research also showed that hurricanes cool the tropics, forming in response to higher temperatures and acting as a thermostat for the area, Huber said.\"Warm water fuels hurricanes, which have been shown to leave cold water in their wake,\" said Huber, who also is a member of the Purdue Climate Change Research Center at Discovery Park. \"I like to say the good news is that hurricanes function like a thermostat for the tropics, and the bad news is that hurricanes function like a thermostat for the tropics. The logical conclusion of this finding, taking into account past research into the impact of rising temperatures on cyclone and hurricane intensity, is that as the world and the tropics warm, there will be an increase in the integrated intensity of hurricanes.\" Movies such as \"The Day After Tomorrow\" brought into the spotlight information about the ocean conveyer belt and its impact on climate. The upper part of the conveyer belt travels from the south to the north, passing through the Pacific Ocean and Indian oceans and past warmer latitudes warming the water brought to North America and Europe, Huber said.In the tropical oceans, this pattern must be reversed; warm, buoyant water must be mixed downward, and cold, dense water must be mixed upward. This process, called vertical mixing, plays an important role in the conveyer belt's circulation. It was known that this mixing occurred, but the cause was not well-understood, said Ryan Sriver, the paper's lead author and a Purdue graduate student.\"Climate models today use what is called 'background mixing' to solve this problem,\" he said. \"They represent the mixing as an average of the total amount that is needed and apply it over these regions consistently. However, we believe this mixing is not consistent; it is not everywhere all of the time. It is sporadic and happens over a small area for a limited amount of time.\"In some areas of the world, such as the equator, there are no cyclones, and no mixing occurs.\"If cyclones were added to models in place of the background mixing, there would be zero mixing at the equator,\" Huber said. \"This is very important because it is well-known that to get El NiÃ±o right in a climate model, the background mixing at the equator must be greatly reduced. Our data has a beautiful no-mixing zone right where there should be no mixing.\" This explains some of the mystery of the observed temperatures from the distant past during a greenhouse climate. The poles were much warmer than today, about 82 degrees Fahrenheit, but the tropics were not much warmer than the present, he said.\"Using the best, most comprehensive models in existence, we could not obtain results that matched this past climate that we know existed,\" Huber said. \"We knew a basic, fundamental process that cooled the tropics was missing from the models.\"The results of the study, being published in the May 31 issue of Nature, are consistent with providing all of the mixing necessary to match what is needed in climate models. \"Our results suggest that this is the missing mixing and it is a vital part of ocean circulation,\" Huber said.Steven Jayne, an assistant scientist at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts, said Huber and Sriver present strong evidence for a cyclone-driven heat pump.\"It is remarkable how closely the amount of mixing generated by the cyclones and the location of this mixing matches what appears to be needed to improve climate models,\" Jayne said. \"People suspected these connections, but no one had done the necessary detailed calculations. It means there may be another feedback loop in the climate system, and that is significant.\"Huber and Sriver studied the cooling effects of hurricanes from 1981 to the present using the cold wakes that follow a hurricane.\"These cold wakes can be easily observed,\" Sriver said. \"The typical size is about 200 kilometers across and about 1,000 kilometers long, or about as big as the Eastern Seaboard.\" The researchers used surface temperature data during the cold wakes to obtain an estimate of the cooling in the tropics due to cyclones and hurricanes. The data analyzed was provided by the National Center for Atmospheric Research, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The team then examined the process that leads to this cooling and evaluated the ocean water mixing.Â \"Multiple studies have shown that tropical cyclones are an excellent source of inertial oscillations, or internal waves that cause mixing in the upper layer of the ocean,\" Huber said. \"It is like putting sugar in a cup of coffee. The sweetened coffee is more dense and will form a layer at the bottom of the cup. It needs to be stirred or agitated somehow to bring the sweet layer up to mix with the rest. The same thing is needed to mix ocean water. Dense water hangs out at bottom unless something stirs it up. Cyclones stir it up in addition to other processes.\"Tropical cyclones cause waves below the surface of the ocean that break, just like what can be seen on the beach shore. When the waves break, the top layer of water curls into the bottom layer and water of different densities and temperatures mix, Huber said.\"Warm, fresh water is less dense than cold, salty water, so the cold water sinks, and this drives the conveyer belt,\" Huber said. \"However, cold, salty water rises in the Pacific, and there has been no complete explanation for this. Cyclones and hurricanes appear to pump warm water down and bring cold water to the surface. Mixing down buoyant, warm water lessens the density of the cold water and allows it to rise \"The study did not examine deep ocean mixing, but it is reasonable to speculate that warm water pumped down joins the ocean circulation and becomes a part of the upper limb of the conveyer belt where dense water makes it up to the surface, Huber said.Huber and Sriver plan to incorporate their findings into a climate model for further testing.\"Current predictions are based on tropical ocean mixing remaining constant or decreasing with warmer temps,\" Huber said. \"This evidence suggests the opposite is true, and upper ocean tropical mixing increases with warmer temperatures. This has major implications for oceanography and climate as a new factor that had not been included in previous predictions.\" The National Science Foundation and the Purdue Research Foundation funded this research. The Purdue Cyber Center and the Office of Information Technology at Purdue provided computational resources and support."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_632", "content": "Two days before the June 1 start of the 2007 hurricane season, University of Florida wind engineers unveiled the worldâs largest portable hurricane wind and rain simulator. Mounted on a trailer, the industrial-sized behemoth is composed of eight 5-foot-tall industrial fans powered by four marine diesel engines that together produce 2,800 horsepower. To cool the engines, the system taps water from a 5,000-gallon tank aboard a truck that doubles as the simulatorâs tow vehicle.UF civil and coastal engineers plan to use the simulator to blast vacant homes with winds of up to 130 mph â Category 3 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale â and high-pressure water jets that mimic wind-driven torrential rain.The goal: to learn more about exactly how hurricanes damage homes, and how to modify them to best prevent that damage.âWe want to conduct experiments to evaluate real homes in communities that are impacted by hurricanes,â said Forrest Masters, an assistant professor of civil and coastal engineering and the leader of the project. âThis simulator also gives us the ability to test home retrofits and new building products aimed at preventing hurricane damage.âThe simulator, which cost about $500,000 in parts and labor, was designed and constructed entirely by Masters, lab manager Jimmy Jesteadt and a team of undergraduate students. It is one of a kind.Unlike previous, smaller simulators, the new simulator uses an innovative hydraulic system, rather than chains or mechanical drive trains, to transfer power from the engines to the fans. Designed by Linde Hydraulics Corporation and Cunningham Fluid Power Inc., the engines spin pumps, which then drive fluid through motors housed in the fans. The result is lighter, less bulky and safer than traditional drive systems, Masters said.At full power, the fans turn at about 1,800 revolutions per minute, producing wind speeds of about 100 mph. A custom-built duct reduces the space available for the air to flow through, ratcheting up the wind speeds to a potential 130 mph. Steering vanes allow the engineers to direct the air wherever they want it to blow.Implanted in the vanes, the water jets can simulate the most extreme rainfall of up to 35 inches per hour, although 8 inches per hour is more typical, Masters said.The simulator is the latest addition to a growing arsenal of hurricane research equipment designed and assembled by UF wind engineering researchers trying to learn more about ground-level hurricane winds and how they affect structures. In a related project, the researchers built several portable hurricane wind monitoring towers that were deployed in the path of land-falling hurricanes in recent years.âWhen this program first started, we brought the lab to the hurricane,â Masters said. âNow, weâre bringing the hurricane back to the lab.âRick Dixon, executive director of the Florida Building Commission, said state officials began to tap UF research for help in strengthening the stateâs hurricane-related building codes shortly after Hurricane Andrew in 1992.The 2004 storms showed that while improved codes were effective in preventing catastrophic building failures, challenges remained in blocking wind and water intrusion, he said. It will take more research to learn how to protect windows, doors, soffits, roof coverings and other so-called âcomponents and claddingsâ â research for which the new wind simulator will be pivotal, he said.âThe test facility that Forrest has built allows us to evaluate those components and claddings and determine where they are failing,â he said. âSo if the building code establishes minimum performances, than that can give us new standards for upgrading the building code.â"}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_633", "content": "Donnelly and Woodruff began reconstructing the history of land-falling hurricanes in the Caribbean in 2003 by gathering sediment-core samples from Laguna Playa Grande on Vieques (Puerto Rico), an island extremely vulnerable to hurricane strikes. They examined the cores for evidence of storm surgesâdistinctive layers of coarse-grained sands and bits of shell interspersed between the organic-rich silt usually found in lagoon sedimentsâand pieced together a 5,000-year chronology of land-falling hurricanes in the region. In examining the record, they found large and dramatic fluctuations in hurricane activity, with long stretches of frequent strikes punctuated by lulls that lasted many centuries. The team then compared their new hurricane record with existing paleoclimate data on El NiÃ±o, the West African monsoon, and other global and regional climate influences. They found the number of intense hurricanes (category 3, 4, and 5 on the Saffir-Simpson scale) typically increased when El NiÃ±o was relatively weak and the West African monsoon was strong.âThe processes that govern the formation, intensity, and track of Atlantic hurricanes are still poorly understood,â said Donnelly, an associate scientist in the WHOI Department of Geology and Geophysics. âBased on this work, we now think that there may be some sort of basin-wide âon-off switchâ for intense hurricanes.âDonnelly and his colleagues have pioneered efforts to extend the chronology of hurricane strikes beyond what can be found in historical texts and modern meteorological records and previously applied their methods to the New England and the Mid-Atlantic coasts of the United States. Their research area, Laguna Playa Grande, is protected and separated from the ocean during all but the most severe tropical storms. However, when an intense hurricane strikes the region, storm surges carry sand from the ocean beach over the dunes and into Laguna Playa Grande. Such âover-toppingâ events leave markers in the geological record that can be examined by researchers in sediment core samples.The geological record from Vieques showed that there were periods of more frequent intense hurricanes from 5,000 to 3,600 years ago, from 2,500 to 1,000 years ago, and from 1700 AD to the present. By contrast, the island was hit less often from 3,600 to 2,500 years ago and from 1,000 to 300 years ago. To ensure that what they were seeing was not just a change in the direction of hurricanes away from Viequesâthat is, different storm tracks across the Atlantic and Caribbeanâthe scientists compared their new records with previous studies from New York and the Gulf Coast. They saw that the Vieques record matched the frequency of land-falling hurricanes in New York and Louisiana, indicating that some Atlantic-wide changes took place.Donnelly and Woodruff, a doctoral student in the MIT/WHOI Joint Graduate Program, then decided to test some other hypotheses about what controls the strength and frequency of hurricanes. They found that periods of frequent El NiÃ±o in the past corresponded with times of less hurricane intensity. Other researchers have established that, within individual years, El NiÃ±o can stunt hurricane activity by causing strong winds at high altitudes that shear the tops off hurricanes or tip them over as they form. When El NiÃ±o was less active in the past, Donnelly and Woodruff found, hurricane cycles picked up.The researchers also examined precipitation records from Lake Ossa, Cameroon, and discovered that when there were increased monsoon rains, there were more frequent intense hurricanes on the other side of the Atlantic. Researchers have theorized that frequent and stronger storms over western Africa lead to easterly atmospheric waves moving into the Atlantic to provide the âseedlingsâ for hurricane development.Much media attention has been focused recently on the importance of warmer ocean waters as the dominant factor controlling the frequency and intensity of hurricanes. And indeed, warmer sea surface temperatures provide more fuel for the formation of tropical cyclones. But the work by Donnelly and Woodruff suggests that El NiÃ±o and the West African monsoon appear to be critical factors for determining long-term cycles of hurricane intensity in the Atlantic.Donnelly and Woodruff published their latest results in the May 24 issue of the journal Nature. The research by Donnelly and Woodruff was funded by the National Science Foundation, the Risk Prediction Initiative, the National Geographic Society, the WHOI Coastal Ocean Institute, and the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation."}

St. Lucie and Martin counties in Florida rank third and fourth, respectively, at 20.8 percent and 20.7 percent. Charleston County, S.C., and Indian River County, Fla., tied for fifth at 20.1 percent.Johnson and Watson based their analysis on statistical models that incorporate the paths of storms from the past 155 years, along with models using the actual climate conditions for January through May 2007 that compute the expected global climate conditions for the rest of the year. The researchers have worked together for 10 years on probability analyses for hurricanes and have released their projections for the past eight years.Johnson is an expert in the statistical aspects of hurricane modeling and forecasting. Watson specializes in developing hazard models based on engineering and geophysics. They collaborate on a Web site, \"Because so much of the U.S. and Florida coastlines are at higher risks for hurricanes, residents need to prepare carefully for the upcoming storm season,\" Johnson said. \"Residents also should expect gas prices to potentially climb higher if the expected disruptions to Gulf of Mexico oil and gas production materialize in 2007.\"The combination of La NiÃ±a weather conditions that are expected to develop throughout the summer and warmer-than-normal Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic Ocean temperatures increase the chances of hurricanes and disruptions in oil and gas production.Of the 852 counties included in the analysis, the probability of hurricane-force winds (74 mph or greater) this year is 15 percent or greater in 61 counties. In an average year, only six counties face probabilities of at least 15 percent.The 20 counties with the highest probabilities for hurricane-force winds include 10 in Florida, eight in North Carolina, one in Louisiana and one in South Carolina.To develop estimates for oil-and-gas production, the researchers operate a computer model that includes every oil platform, pipeline, refinery and terminal in the Gulf of Mexico. The model simulated how every storm since 1851 would have affected oil and gas infrastructure based on 2007 locations.In those simulations, at least one week's worth of production in the Gulf has been disrupted in 98 percent of the years with La Niña conditions. Johnson and Watson have developed maps to support local mitigation strategies for the State of Florida, developed data for Caribbean governments in an effort funded by the Organization of American States and researched hurricane damage models used in the insurance industry. Watson is assisting the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and Watson and Johnson are actively working on research on the potential impact of climate change on hurricanes and hurricane damage frequencies.They also have worked as consultants to the Florida Commission on Hurricane Loss Projection Methodology, which reviews and accepts public and private hurricane insurance models."}

Conrad            C. Lautenbacher, Ph.D., undersecretary of commerce for oceans and            atmosphere and NOAA administrator. An average Atlantic hurricane season            brings 11 named storms, with six becoming hurricanes, including two            major hurricanes.           Climate patterns responsible for the expected above normal 2007 hurricane            activity continue to be the ongoing multi-decadal signal (the set of            ocean and atmospheric conditions that spawn increased Atlantic hurricane            activity), warmer-than-normal sea surface temperatures in the Atlantic            Ocean and the El            NiÃ±o/La NiÃ±a cycle.Last            year, seasonal hurricane predictions proved to be too high when an unexpected            El NiÃ±o rapidly developed and created a hostile environment for            Atlantic storms to form and strengthen. When storms did develop, steering            currents kept most of them over the open water and away from land.\"There            is some uncertainty this year as to whether or not La NiÃ±a will            form, and if it does how strong it will be,\" said Gerry Bell, Ph.D.,            lead seasonal hurricane forecaster at the NOAA Climate Prediction Center.            \"The Climate Prediction Center is indicating that La NiÃ±a            could form in the next one to three months. If La NiÃ±a develops,            storm activity will likely be in the upper end of the predicted range,            or perhaps even higher depending on how strong La NiÃ±a becomes.            Even if La NiÃ±a does not develop, the conditions associated with            the ongoing active hurricane era still favor an above-normal season.\"            Bell also            noted that pre-season storms, such as Subtropical Storm Andrea in early            May, are not an indicator of the hurricane season ahead. \"With            or without Andrea, NOAA's forecast is for an above normal season.\"\"With            expectations for an active season, it is critically important that people            who live in East and Gulf coastal areas as well as the Caribbean be            prepared,\" said Bill Proenza, NOAA            National Hurricane Center director. \"Now is the time to update            your hurricane plan, not when the storm is bearing down on you.\"The Atlantic            hurricane season runs from June 1 through November 30, with peak activity            occurring August through October.

{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_636", "content": "\"With this technique, meteorologists         for the first time will be able to monitor the strength of a hurricane         every few minutes as it approaches landfall and quickly alert coastal         communities if it suddenly intensifies or weakens,\" says NCAR scientist       Wen-Chau Lee.The technique is known as VORTRAC, which stands for Vortex       Objective Radar Tracking and Circulation.VORTRAC uses the Doppler radar         network established by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration         (NOAA) in the 1980s and 1990s. About 20 of these radars are scattered         along the Gulf and Atlantic coastlines from Texas to Maine. Each radar         can measure winds blowing toward or away from it, but no single radar       could provide a 3-D picture of hurricane winds before now.Lee and his         collaborators developed a series of mathematical formulas that combine         data from a single radar near the center of a landfalling storm with         general knowledge of Atlantic hurricane structure in order to map the         approaching system's winds in three dimensions. The technique also infers         the barometric pressure in the eye of the hurricane, a very reliable       index of its strength.Forecasters using VORTRAC can update information about a hurricane each time a NOAA Doppler radar scans the storm, which can be as often as about every six minutes. Without such a technique, forecasters would need at least two coastal radars in close proximity to each other in order to obtain the same information. But most of the network's radars are too far apart to qualify.Because of the limited range of         Doppler radars, VORTRAC works only for hurricanes that are within about         120 miles of land. Depending on a hurricane's speed, that could enable         forecasters to monitor it for the critical 10-15 hours or so before landfall.         The National Hurricane Center will test VORTRAC during this year's hurricane       season, which officially starts on June 1.To monitor the winds of a         landfalling hurricane, forecasters now rely on aircraft to drop instrument         packages into the storm that gather data on winds and pressure. But due         to flight logistics, the aircraft can take readings no more than every         few hours, which means that coastal communities may not be swiftly alerted         to changes in approaching hurricanes. In 2004, parts of Florida's southwest         coast were caught by surprise when Hurricane Charley's top winds increased         from 110 to 145 miles per hour in just six hours as the storm neared       land.Lee and his collaborators applied VORTRAC retroactively to Hurricane         Charley. In a recent article in Geophysical Research Letters, they reported         that the technique would have accurately captured the burst in the hurricane's       intensity.\"Our research shows that this technique can capture sudden         intensity changes in potentially dangerous hurricanes,\" says NCAR scientist       Michael Bell, a coauthor of the article.In time, VORTRAC may also help           improve long-range hurricane forecasts by using data from airborne         radars to produce detailed information about a hurricane that is far         out to sea. Forecasters could input the data to computer models to         improve three- and five-day forecasts.The research was funded primarily           by the National Science Foundation and NOAA."}

{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_638", "content": "Using computer simulations and observations of 1998's Hurricane Bonnie in southern North Carolina, scientists were able to get a detailed view of pockets of swirling, warm humid air moving from the eye of the storm to the ring of strong thunderstorms in the eyewall that contributed to the intensification of the hurricane. The findings suggest that the flow of air parcels between the eye and eye wall - largely believed trivial in the past - is a key element in hurricane intensity and that there's more to consider than just the classic \"in-up-and-out\" flow pattern. The classic pattern says as air parcels flow \"in\" to the hurricane's circulation, they rise \"up,\" form precipitating clouds and transport warm air to the upper atmosphere before moving \"out\" into surrounding environmental air.\"Our results improve understanding of the mechanisms that play significant roles in hurricane intensity,\" said Scott Braun, research meteorologist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Md. \"The spinning flow of air parcels - or vortices - in the eye can carry very warm, moist eye air into the eyewall that acts as a turbocharger for the hurricane heat engine.\" The research appears in the June 2007 issue of the American Meteorological Society's Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences.  \"While the 'in-up-and out' pattern has been the prevailing paradigm for the past five decades, when you closely examine intense hurricanes it's apparent that a second family of moist air parcels often travels from the border of the eyewall to the eye, where it picks up moisture from the ocean surface,\" said co-author Michael Montgomery, professor of meteorology at the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School, Monterey, Calif. \"These moisture-enriched air parcels then rather quickly return to the main eyewall and collectively raise the heat content of the lower eyewall cloud, similar to increasing the octane level in auto fuel.\"The researchers analyzed thousands of virtual particles to track the movement of air between the eye and eyewall, and between the eyewall and its outside environment. To uncover the impact of these particles on storm intensity, they used a simulation of Hurricane Bonnie from a sophisticated computer model and data gathered during the NASA Convection and Moisture Experiment (CAMEX). The simulation has also helped to explain the formation of deep \"hot towers\" observed in Bonnie and many other hurricanes by NASA's Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite. TRMM carries the first and only space-based precipitation radar that allows researchers to peer through clouds and get a 3-D view of storm structure. It captured a particularly deep hot tower in Bonnie as the storm intensified several days before striking North Carolina.  Hot towers are deep, thick clouds that reach to the top of the troposphere, the lowest layer of the atmosphere, usually about ten miles high in the tropics. The updrafts within these \"towers\" act like express elevators, accelerating the movement of energy that boosts hurricane strength, and are called \"hot\" because of the large amount of latent heat they release as water vapor is condensed into cloud droplets. Deep hot towers in the eyewall are usually associated with a strengthening storm.  In previous research, Braun, Montgomery, and Zhaoxia Pu of the University of Utah, Salt Lake City, found a direct relationship between these deep hot towers and the intense vortices inside the eye. \"The vortices were shown to be especially crucial in providing the focus and lift needed for hot tower formation and add insight into when and where hot towers will develop in storms,\" said Braun. The study was published in the January 2006 CAMEX special issue of the Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences. Vortices are created in response to the rapid change in wind speed from the fierce eyewall to the calm eye. Near the surface, air spiraling inward collides with these vortices to force air up, forming updrafts. Strong updrafts in the eyewall carry moisture much higher than normal and help create hot towers. The current study suggests that in addition to providing lift, these vortices also feed high energy air from the low-level eye into the eyewall, boosting the strength of the updrafts. This transfer of energy allows the storm to remain stronger than expected, particularly when encountering weakening influences, including cooler ocean water temperatures and wind shear, the change in the direction and speed of winds with altitude. \"This discovery may help explain why strong storms can remain intense for several hours or longer after encountering conditions that usually bring weakening,\" said Montgomery. \"Ongoing research will add to our understanding of the dynamics associated with storm intensity so that we can pinpoint the variables and processes that must be represented in numerical models to improve intensity forecasts.\"When hurricane Bonnie finally began to lose strength a couple days before landfall, a significant amount of air in the eyewall was traced back - not to the eye - but to the middle levels of the atmosphere away from the storm. This inflow was caused by wind shear and brought much cooler, drier environmental air into Bonnie's circulation, acting like an anti-fuel to reduce energy in the storm and weaken its strong winds.Despite these and other recent advances in understanding the internal workings of hurricanes, forecasting their intensity is still a significant challenge. \"Most of today's computer models that aid forecasters cannot sufficiently account for the extremely complex processes within hurricanes, and model performance is strongly dependent on the information they are given on the structure of a storm,\" said Braun. \"We also typically only see small parts of a storm at a given time. That is why it is important to combine data from field experiments such as CAMEX with data from TRMM and other satellites. As observing technologies and models improve, so too will forecasts.\""}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_639", "content": "According to the study authors, including Marine Biological Laboratory (MBL) Assistant Research Scientist, Dr. Linda Amaral Zettler, while floodwaters pumped from New Orleans back into Lake Ponchartrain following the Hurricanes showed higher-than-normal levels of bacteria and pathogens, fecal indicator microbe and pathogen concentrations in the lake returned to pre-hurricane levels within two months. However, the sediments left behind in the flooded regions of the city appear to contain microbes commonly found in sewage treatment and remain a cause for concern because they may serve as a potential source of ongoing microbial exposure. The reportÂ  maintains that further investigation is needed to evaluate the microbial quality of floodwater sediments deposited in the New Orleans area and highly recommends epidemiologic studies to determine whether there is an elevated risk of exposure to human pathogens through contact, ingestion, and inhalation of these sediments.The study was a collaborative response of several institutions, including the Woods Hole Center for Oceans and Human Health, of which the MBL and Amaral Zettler are a part. The researchers began collecting water and sediment samples from the interior canals and shoreline of New Orleans and the offshore waters of Lake Pontchartrain in October 2005 after the floodwaters had receded.  They examined the presence of a diverse group of microbes including fecal indicators E.coli and others,as well as human pathogenic bacteria Vibrio and Legionella. Amaral Zettler and her colleagues at the MBL led the effort to analyze overall microbial diversity in the post-hurricane water and sediment samples using DNA sequencing technology.  Through analyzing the DNA makeup of the microbes found, they were able to get a big picture view of the kinds of microbes in the environment and whether or not they were similar in makeup to known pathogens or to microbes typically found in sewage treatment. Amaral Zettler points out the importance of knowing the microbial landscape of an area before a natural disaster hits. Some pathogens are endemic to the natural environment and some are introduced through sewage and run-off.  Likewise, microbial communities are under the influence of seasonal variability in temperature and salinity that will naturally affect microbial population structure. \"Our hope is that this data will provide some perspective not just on the immediate impact to the area, but the long term effects of this kind of natural disaster,\" says Amaral Zettler. \"We certainly know a lot more now about the microbial diversity present in Pontchartrain than we did when we started the study.\"According to Amaral Zettler, the Centers for Oceans and Human Health network enabled the team to mobilize quickly. The logistics of sampling were tremendous,\" she says.  \"Security was huge and the logistics of just getting around the city at that time were not trivial,\" she says.   A collaborative grant from the National Science Foundation made it possible for the scientists to leverage their expertise and use their resources to contribute to a common goal. \"We really felt that as centers we were serving a role.  This research would have been next to impossible if we would have had to go it alone--a true example of the whole being greater than the sum of its parts.\"This work was funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF), the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences Ocean and Human Health Program, and the NSF Small Grant for Exploratory Research Program, the NSF Research Experiences for Undergraduates Program, and by the Georgia Sea Grant College Program.

{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_640", "content": "The research, which is featured in the March 2007 issue of the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society (BAMS), explains that current predictive models used in forecasting hurricane formation and intensity have difficulty accurately representing data such as ocean temperature, surface wind, rain and waves, and pressure and wind-speed relationships. A new fully coupled atmosphere-wave-ocean modeling system is capable of forecasting detailed hurricane inner-core structure, as well as surface temperature and wind, ocean currents, and surface waves that are crucial for improving hurricane intensity forecasts.  The CBLAST â Hurricane field program was conducted from 2002 to 2004 using NOAA's âHurricane Hunterâ aircraft, as well as drifting buoys and subsurface floats deployed ahead of Hurricanes Fabian in 2003, and Frances in 2004. Dr. William Drennan, associate professor of applied marine physics and one of the scientists who participated in the fieldwork, has helped to provide an unprecedented amount of information about how variations in ocean and sea surface conditions can accelerate or inhibit the intensification of hurricanes.  âMeasuring processes near the sea-surface in hurricanes is a challenge! The CBLAST field program which brought together many new ideas and techniques has provided a wealth of new data that will help us to improve our understanding of how hurricanes gain and lose energy,â Drennan said  Rosenstiel scientist Dr. Shuyi Chen, a professor of meteorology and physical oceanography, led CBLAST's Hurricane modeling effort. She and other scientists have developed a fully coupled atmosphere-wave-ocean, high-resolution model able to predict the structure of a hurricane eye and eyewall at nearly a 1-km resolution, which is well within the recommendation for next-generation hurricane-prediction models set by the NOAA Science Advisory Board Hurricane Intensity Research Working Group.  âExtreme high winds, intense rainfall, large surface waves, strong ocean currents, and copious sea spray in hurricanes are all difficult to measure, limiting our capability in predicting their effects on hurricane intensity. The new coupled model takes into account the fully interactive nature of the atmosphere and ocean in tropical storms and represents an important first step toward developing the next-generation hurricane prediction models,â Chen said.  The effect of air-sea interactions on hurricane structure and intensity change is the main focus of the CBLAST â Hurricane program. The new, high-resolution model for hurricane research and prediction is a fully integrative modeling system, taking advantage of the new observations from the CBLAST field program to account for data from three important aspects of hurricane modeling. The overall modeling system is comprised of an atmospheric model, a surface wave model, and an ocean circulation model, all of which combine to form an innovative way of modeling storms.  CBLAST â Hurricane modeling and observation efforts were sponsored by the Office of Naval Research (ONR), and involved many scientists from numerous universities as well as from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). âIt is one of the most comprehensive studies ever of the way the ocean and atmosphere interact in hurricanes, offering the scientific community new pathways in modeling and observation that will lead to further predictive modeling progress. Improved weather forecasting will have global impacts; helping every nation affected by hurricanes and typhoons,â said Dr. Linwood Vincent, Acting Head of the Ocean, Atmosphere and Space Research Division of ONR.  The 2005 Hurricane season highlighted the urgent need for better understanding of the factors that contribute to hurricane formation and intensity change, and for developing future predictive models to improve intensity forecasts. Scientists are hoping that with improved predictive science will come better preparation and warning for areas affected by tropical storms."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_641", "content": "The past 10 hurricane seasons have been the most active on record, with climatologists predicting that heightened activity could continue for another 10 to 40 years. In early April, Colorado State University meteorologists predicted a very active 2007 hurricane season for the Atlantic coast, with 17 named storms, including 5 major hurricanes. The analysis included a 74 percent probability of a major hurricane hitting the U.S. coast before the season ends on November 30. \"Coastal areas in the southern United States are adapted to disturbance from both fire and high wind,\" says Stanturf, project leader of the SRS disturbance ecology unit based in Athens, GA. \"But those adaptations only go so far in the face of a major hurricane. Forest owners and natural resource managers need strategies to deal with hurricane damage to coastal forests.\"In early fall 2005, Hurricanes Katrina and Rita caused what may be the most costly natural disaster in U.S. history, with over 5.5 million acres of timberland in the coastal states of Texas , Lousiana , Mississippi , and Alabama affected. Using available data on the damage from these storms, the researchers constructed an adaptive strategy that distinguishes event risk (hurricane occurrence) from the vulnerability of coastal forests and outcome risk (hurricane severity). \"There really isn't any way for managers to reduce the risk of a hurricane occurring or the severity of a hurricane when it hits,\" says Stanturf. \"The long-term focus of managers should be on reducing the vulnerability of coastal ecosystems, particularly in those areas with higher event risk.\" The researchers developed an approach that considers all the potential disturbances in an area--the threat matrix--then assesses the risks of severe hurricanes within this context. Activities following a hurricane event are divided into those dealing with immediate outcomes (short-term) and those managing the recovery (long-term). \"If disturbances such as major hurricanes are in the threat matrix of an area, policies and procedures should be in place to manage effects,\" says Stanturf. \"The infrastructure to restore access and communication should be put into place before the storm hits to meet both the short-term goals of salvage and fire prevention and the long-term goal of reforestation and ecological recovery.\"Stanturf and fellow authors use the case study of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita to illustrate the major decisions and actions that must be taken after a major event. These include rapid assessment of damage, protection of timber resources and recovery of value, management of second order events such as wildfire, protection of other resources such as endangered plants and animals, and best practices for proceeding with salvage.\"Stands within a hurricane damage zone that are not salvaged will require monitoring for up to 5 years to detect delayed mortality or the onset of insect infestations or diseases,\" says Stanturf. \"Beyond the initial flurry of cleanup and salvage logging, the recovery process will take many years, and require the investment of time and resources. The recovery period is a good time to look at how to reduce the vulnerability of forests.\"Vulnerability can be lessened by converting to species that are less susceptible to hurricane damage, by controlling stand structure, and by dispersing harvesting and thinning operations. The authors simulated the potential damage to 9 theoretical stands of pine trees, looking at how each would react to hurricane wind speeds, to make recommendations for different situations.\"Our simple simulation of stem breakage potential suggests that stand spacing and tree height can be manipulated to reduce risk, and provides a start for managing forests for hurricane risk,\" says Stanturf. \"Additional research is needed on the effects on vulnerability of fragmentation, harvest systems, and other aspects of stand structure.\""}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_642", "content": "This new finding is reported in a study by scientists at the Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science at the University of Miami and NOAA's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) in Princeton, N.J., and, scheduled to be published April 18th in Geophysical Research Letters.While other studies have linked global warming to an increase in hurricane intensity, this study is the first to identify changes in wind shear that could counteract these effects.  \"The environmental changes found here do not suggest a strong increase in tropical Atlantic hurricane activity during the 21st century,\" said Brian Soden, Rosenstiel School associate professor of meteorology and physical oceanography and the paper's co-author.  However, the study does identify other regions, such as the western tropical Pacific, where global warming does cause the environment to become more favorable for hurricanes. \"Wind shear is one of the dominant controls to hurricane activity, and the models project substantial increases in the Atlantic,\" said Gabriel Vecchi, lead author of the paper and a research oceanographer at GFDL.  \"Based on historical relationships, the impact on hurricane activity of the projected shear change could be as large -- and in the opposite sense -- as that of the warming oceans.\"Examining possible impacts of human-caused greenhouse warming on hurricane activity, the researchers used climate models to assess changes in the environmental factors tied to hurricane formation and intensity.  They focused on projected changes in vertical wind shear over the tropical Atlantic and its ties to the Pacific Walker circulation -- a vast loop of winds that influences climate across much of the globe and that varies in concert with El NiÃ±o and La NiÃ±a oscillations. By examining 18 different models, the authors identified a systematic increase in wind shear over much of the tropical Atlantic due to a slowing of the Pacific Walker circulation. Their research suggests that the increase in wind shear could inhibit both hurricane development and intensification.  \"This study does not, in any way, undermine the widespread consensus in the scientific community about the reality of global warming,\" said Soden. \"In fact, the wind shear changes are driven by global warming.\"  The authors also note that additional research will be required to fully understand how the increased wind shear affects hurricane activity more specifically. \"This doesn't settle the issue; this is one piece of the puzzle that will contribute to an incredibly active field of research,\" Vecchi said."}

Through this endeavor, NOAA is exploring partnerships with countries            and scientific organizations in the Americas and Caribbean to share            Earth observations and develop and strengthen data networks. Western            Hemisphere nations will work together to ensure the satellite data are            disseminated and training is available to enable full use of the new            information. \"The            satellite is functioning well and ready for hurricane season,\"            said Gilberto CÃ¢mara, Ph.D., director of Brazil's National Space            Research Institute (Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais). \"In            the past, coverage has been interrupted during hurricanes and other            severe weather events in the U.S. Now, South Americans will have continuing            satellite coverage. We will no longer be left in the dark.\"Â NOAA's            GOES satellites orbit Earth's equator at a speed matching the planet's            rotation, allowing them to hover over one position. They provide scientists            with detailed weather measurements and frequent imagery used to develop            short-term forecasts that help protect life and livelihoods. In South            America, the new satellite coverage is already having an impact. On            March 8, for instance, Argentina was able to trace a low pressure development            and then accurately issue a high-rainfall alert that helped save lives            in Buenos Aires and other highly-populated areas. The new coverage also            is contributing to improved fire detection in the Amazon rainforest            of western Brazil.In            addition, GOES-10 is providing South America with images of the Earth's            atmosphere system twice as frequently as before. South America now receives            coverage nearly as far south as the South Pole, with images every 15            minutes. History has proven that there is a vital need for the advanced            warning this additional information may provide. During the1990s in            South America, natural disasters caused nearly 70,000 deaths, and more            than half were from flooding. Storms, cyclones, hurricanes and mudslides            caused another 20 percent of the deaths. In May 2003, the largest flooding            in 500 years hit Argentina's north-central region, displacing more than            100,000 people and causing $1 billion in damage.Â In the            Western Hemisphere, nine countries are working with global            partners to build GEOSS, including Argentina, Brazil, Belize, Canada,            Chile, Honduras, Mexico, Paraguay and the United States. More countries            are expected to begin participating later this year. In the U.S., 15            federal agencies and three White House offices are engaged in developing            the U.S. component of GEOSS. The goal of the integrated system of systems            is to provide comprehensive, coordinated and sustained Earth observations            from thousands of instruments worldwide, transforming the data they            collect into a range of societal benefits spanning global public health,            energy, agriculture and weather and climate, among others."}

Gene Takle, professor of agronomy and geological and atmospheric sciences, and colleagues Mike Chen and Xiaoqing Wu in atmospheric science were asked to develop a set of guidelines for rebuilding coastal forests based on their research on wind reduction by the use of agricultural shelterbelts.The Iowa State group was commissioned to write a paper on designing coastal forests and shelterbelts, which are known as \"bioshields.\" Takle represented the group at a workshop under sponsorship of the FAO last summer in Khao Lak, Thailand, where hundreds of bodies had washed up on the beach after the 2004 tsunami.\"Much loss of life from this tsunami was attributed to destruction of coastal forests. Villages in India and Southeast Asia that preserved their coastal mangroves suffered far less damage,\" Takle said. \"FAO requested guidelines for rebuilding these bioshields based on our work and understanding of agricultural shelterbelts.\"Their suggested guidelines include planting trees as close to the sea as possible; using short salt-tolerant and sparse shelters on the seaward edge; using tall species of high wind resistance on the landward side; and leaving gaps between rows and irregularly within the rows to extend the protected zone, but allowing for onshore flow of the cooling sea-breeze in nonhazardous conditions.\"Very little research has been done on this topic, so we used our computer model and previous experience on flow through living barriers to evaluate alternative shelter designs like tree heights, density, spacing and orientation to develop our recommendations,\" Takle said.Federal managers in Southeast Asia and India will consider the guidelines when rebuilding damaged coastal areas.Takle has teamed with meteorology graduate students Dan Rajewski and Sarah Schmidt to conduct additional studies to refine the preliminary guidelines he presented at the Thailand workshop and explore additional uses of bioshields against high winds."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_645", "content": "One of the research team's surprising conclusions: when it comes to the damage they wreak, hurricanes and tsunamis can bring surprisingly similar forces to bear. \"A lot of the hurricane damage along the Mississippi coastline came from storm surges -- not from high winds or levee flooding that occurred in the New Orleans area,\" said Yin Lu \"Julie\" Young, an assistant professor of civil and environmental engineering at Princeton University. \"Storm surges result in very different mechanisms. When it comes to forces on a structure, what happens in a storm surge is very similar to what happens in a tsunami.\"During a storm surge, structures that were built to withstand the downward force of gravity now must cope with a totally different force: the upward and lateral push of water. In addition, buildings have to withstand assaults from debris caught up in the surge.\"Eighteen-wheeler containers, freed floating barges, and boats can all become projectiles that will strike objects in their path,\" said Young. \"Large debris may also become lodged between structural elements like columns and lead to complete collapse of the structures.\"Young's collaborators are Ronald Riggs and Ian Robertson, professors at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, and Solomon Yim, a professor at Oregon State University. The team members will publish their work in an upcoming special edition of the Journal of Waterway, Port, Coastal and Ocean Engineering.During their two field visits, the team took more than 2,000 photographs of the destruction to the Mississippi coast. One of Young's favorites is a photograph of a stack of delicate unchipped china that survived the storm completely unharmed. All that remains of the church where the china was used is a bent steel frame. \"You have to appreciate the irony of nature,\" Young said. \"Most of the time, the scenery is tragic, ironic, and beautiful all at the same time.\"One of the group's interesting research findings from the Mississippi work has to do with a phenomenon better known for occurring in neither hurricanes nor tsunamis but, rather, earthquakes. That is something known as \"liquefaction.\" As the storm surge recedes, the sudden decrease in downward pressure on the saturated soil causes the sand to liquefy and flow out like a heavy slurry.  This can lead to the eventual collapse of buildings, highways, or bridge abutments, as well as gigantic potholes along coastal roads.The team was awarded a NSF NEES-SG grant to study the effect of tsunamis on engineered structures.  The final goal of the project is to develop design recommendations to enhance the safety of coastal infrastructures subject to tsunamis. \"If you consider the gravitation, wind, seismic and wave forces, as well as the surrounding soil composition, a building can be designed such that it should be available for immediate occupancy after a minor event, and be able to remain structurally intact to allow for safe evacuation during a Category 3 hurricane like Katrina,\" said Young.Understanding how to build hurricane-resistant buildings is one thing; getting society to implement that knowledge is quite another, Young said. \"Politics and human values come into play,\" she said. \"People are resilient and have short memories and think that if another hurricane comes along they can just rebuild. I admire their strength but at the same time there is a certain stubbornness about not learning from past mistakes. People like to do what they did before because it's easier than fixing the root of the problem.\"Last week, Young gave a presentation on her research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  She will also be giving presentations at the Oregon State University, California Institute of Technology, the University of Southern California, and the University of California at Berkeley.  \"We hope to present our findings widely so that engineers can learn from this and modify future design codes to minimize damage,\" she said.Title: Lessons from Hurricane Katrina Storm Surge on Bridges and Buildings, By Ian N. Robertson, H. Ronald Riggs, Solomon Yim and Yin Lu Young.Abstract : The storm surge associated with Hurricane Katrina caused tremendous damage along the Gulf Coast in Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama. Similar damage was observed subsequent to the Indian Ocean Tsunami of December 26, 2004. In order to gain a better understanding of the performance of engineered structures subjected to coastal inundation due to tsunami or hurricane storm surge, the authors surveyed damage to bridges, buildings and other coastal infrastructure subsequent to Hurricane Katrina.  Numerous lessons were learned from analysis of the observed damage, and these are reported herein. A number of structures experienced significant structural damage due to storm surge and wave action. Structural members submerged during the inundation were subjected to significant hydrostatic uplift forces due to buoyancy, enhanced by trapped air pockets, and hydrodynamic uplift forces due to wave action.  Any floating or mobile object in the nearshore/on-shore areas can become floating debris, affecting structures in two ways: impact and water-damming. Foundation soils and foundation systems are at risk from shear- and liquefaction-induced scour, unless designed appropriately."}

Long-term averages are 9.6 named storms, 5.9 hurricanes and 2.3 intense hurricanes per year.\"We are calling for a very active hurricane season this year, but not as active as the 2004 and 2005 seasons,\" said Phil Klotzbach of the Colorado State hurricane forecast team. \"Based on our latest forecast, the probability of a major hurricane making landfall along the U.S. coastline is 74 percent compared with the last-century average of 52 percent.\"In December and January, we had a weak to moderate El Nino event in the tropical Pacific Ocean. When you have El Nino conditions during the hurricane season, it increases vertical wind shear across the tropical Atlantic and typically results in a weaker tropical cyclone season,\" Klotzbach said. \"However, we've seen El Nino conditions dissipate quite rapidly late this winter, so we do not think that's going to be an inhibiting factor this year. Also, we have warm Atlantic sea surface temperatures this year which we've seen just about every year since 1995.\"The hurricane forecast team predicts tropical cyclone activity in 2007 will be 185 percent of the average season. By comparison, 2005 witnessed tropical cyclone activity that was about 275 percent of the average season.The hurricane forecast team reiterated its probabilities for a major hurricane making landfall on U.S. soil:The team also predicted above-average major hurricane landfall risk in the Caribbean.\"We were quite fortunate last year in that we had no hurricane landfalls,\" Klotzbach said. \"The 2006 season was only the 12th year since 1945 that the United States witnessed no hurricane landfalls. Since then, we have had only two consecutive-year periods where there were no hurricane landfalls - 1981-1982 and 2000-2001.\"The Colorado State hurricane forecast team has cautioned against reading too much into the hurricane seasons of 2004 and 2005 when Florida and the Gulf Coast were ravaged by four landfalling hurricanes each year. Hurricanes Charley, Frances, Ivan and Jeanne caused devastating damage in 2004 followed by Dennis, Katrina, Rita and Wilma in 2005.\"The activity of these two years was unusual, but within the natural bounds of hurricane variation,\" said William Gray, who began forecasting hurricane seasons at Colorado State 24 years ago. \"Following the two very active seasons of 2004 and 2005, 2006 experienced slightly below-average activity with no landfalling hurricanes.\"We've had an upturn of major storms since 1995,\" Gray said. \"We think this upturn of major storms will continue for another 15 or 20 years.\"Probabilities of tropical storm-force, hurricane-force and intense hurricane-force winds occurring at specific locations along the U.S. East and Gulf Coasts within a variety of time periods are listed on the forecast team's Landfall Probability Web site. The site provides U.S. landfall probabilities for 11 regions, 55 sub-regions and 205 individual counties along the U.S. coastline from Brownsville, Texas, to Eastport, Maine. The Web site, available to the public at The hurricane team's forecasts are based on the premise that global oceanic and atmospheric conditions - such as El NiÃ±o, sea surface temperatures and sea level pressures - that preceded active or inactive hurricane seasons in the past provide meaningful information about similar trends in future seasons.For 2007, Gray and the hurricane forecast team expect continued warm tropical and north Atlantic sea-surface temperatures, prevalent in most years since 1995, as well as neutral or weak La Nina conditions - a recipe for greatly enhanced Atlantic basin hurricane activity. These factors are similar to conditions that occurred during the 1952, 1964, 1966, 1995 and 2003 seasons. The average of these five seasons had well above-average activity, and Klotzbach and Gray predict the 2007 season will have activity in line with the average of these five years.Gray does not attribute changes in recent and projected Atlantic hurricane activity to human-induced global warming.\"Although global surface temperatures have increased over the last century and over the last 30 years, there is no reliable data available to indicate increased hurricane frequency or intensity in any of the globe's seven tropical cyclone basins, except for the Atlantic over the past 12 years,\" Gray said. \"Meteorologists who study tropical cyclones have no valid physical theory as to why hurricane frequency or intensity would necessarily be altered significantly by small amounts of global mean temperature change.\""}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_647", "content": "Proper evaluation of the air-sea exchange under extreme winds is of great importance for modeling and forecasting used in hurricane studies, such as in forecasting of storm track and intensity, surges, waves, and currents, particularly since our coasts have become so heavily populated. These results should be of widespread interest to the public, oceanographers, atmospheric scientists, numerical modelers, oil and gas concerns, commerce, and government agencies, explains William Teague of NRL. This research has a direct impact on storm surge modeling. Many models have been estimating the air-sea momentum exchange by assuming that it increases as the wind speed increases. But the NRL research definitely shows that this is not the case. This research will lead to a better estimation of the air-sea momentum exchange which will improve both ocean circulation and storm surge models.During NRL's Slope to Shelf Energetics and Exchange Dynamics (SEED) field experiment, six current profiler moorings were deployed on the continental shelf at water depths ranging between 60 and 90 meters just west of the DeSoto Canyon, about 100 miles south of Mobile Bay, Alabama. Eight moorings were also deployed down the slope, but not used in this study. Fortuitously, early on September 16, the eye of Hurricane Ivan passed directly over the array of moorings. Historically, instruments moored in the ocean do not even survive such powerful storms, much less direct hits. Fortunately, all of the SEED moorings survived this powerful storm, and provided the best ocean measurements of currents and waves ever obtained directly under a major hurricane.  Past studies have attempted to determine the air-sea momentum exchange from the atmospheric side of the air-sea interface (\"top-down determination\") using limited, difficult to interpret meteorological observations and/or models developed for the atmospheric boundary layer. For instance, drop sondes launched from airplanes during hurricanes have been used to measure wind profiles and to estimate air-sea momentum transfer. These wind analyses suggest that the air-sea momentum transfer decreases at high wind speeds, not increases as previously thought. No attempt has been made to determine this momentum transfer independently based on ocean observations until now. The initial forced oceanic response to Hurricane Ivan on the continental shelf consisted of a strong barotropic flow and a much weaker baroclinic component. This response was governed to the first order by the linear time-dependent depth-integrated momentum balance. Such behavior of the currents allowed a direct estimation of air-sea momentum exchange for winds greater than 20 meters per second. NRL's direct derivation of the air-sea momentum exchange using unique ocean current profiles measured directly under Hurricane Ivan confirms the trend suggested by studies based on meteorological measurements and models developed for the atmospheric boundary layer. NRL researchers found that the exchange decreases when hurricane winds exceed 32 meters per second. These findings are compared with the atmospheric-based work using the drag coefficient. The wind stress at the sea surface, which was directly calculated from current measurements, is related to the square of the wind speed times the drag coefficient.  NRL researchers were able to determine good estimates of the drag coefficient with error bounds for high winds up to 48 meters per second.Â"}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_648", "content": "In June and July 2006, there were several significant dust storms over the Sahara Desert in Africa. As this dust traveled westward into the Atlantic, satellite data show that the particles blocked sunlight from reaching the ocean surface, causing ocean waters to cool. These cooler waters may have impeded some storminess since hurricanes rely on warm waters to form. The 2006 Atlantic hurricane season wrapped up on Nov. 30 with just four tropical storms and five hurricanes, relatively calm compared to the record number of 12 tropical storms and 15 hurricanes in 2005. While several factors likely contributed to the sharp decrease in the number of storms, \"this research is the first to show that dust does have a major effect on seasonal hurricane activity,\" said lead author William Lau, chief of the Laboratory for Atmospheres at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Md. \"Dust concentrations may play as big a role as other atmospheric conditions, like El NiÃ±o, and offer some predictive value, so they should be closely monitored to improve hurricane forecasts.\"Other researchers, however, say that atmospheric dust may have had relatively little influence on the 2006 hurricane season compared to the effects of underlying El NiÃ±o conditions.Sea surface temperatures in 2006 across the prime hurricane-breeding regions of the Atlantic and Caribbean were found to be as much as 1 degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit) cooler than in 2005. Most striking was how quickly sea surface temperatures responded to variations in the amount of Saharan dust, Lau said. Following the most significant dust outbreak, which occurred in June and July, ocean waters cooled abruptly in just two weeks, suggesting that the dust had an almost immediate effect.The dust worked to cool the ocean, but it also warmed the atmosphere by absorbing more of the sun's energy. This temperature difference resulted in a shift in the large-scale atmospheric circulation. As air rose over West Africa and the tropical Atlantic, it sank and became less moist over the western Atlantic and Caribbean. This pattern helped to increase surface winds that enhanced ocean evaporation and churned deeper, colder waters, causing the area of cool seas to expand. Lau and co-author Kyu-Myong Kim of Goddard analyzed data on ocean temperatures, clouds, and water vapor from NASA's Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission satellite and atmospheric dust levels from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument on NASA's Aura satellite. The study was published in the Feb. 27 issue of the American Geophysical Union's Eos.The research also considered the role of El NiÃ±o by examining historical data on the intensity and development of tropical storms and hurricanes across the Atlantic basin. \"We found that Saharan dust may have a stronger influence than El NiÃ±o on hurricane formation in the subtropical western Atlantic and Caribbean, but that El NiÃ±o has a greater impact in the tropical eastern Atlantic, where many storms are generated,\" said Lau. El NiÃ±o is the periodic warming of the ocean waters in the central and eastern equatorial Pacific, which in turn can influence pressure and wind patterns across the tropical Atlantic.\"In 2006, it is quite possible that the Saharan dust may have amplified or even initiated pre-existing atmosphere-ocean conditions due to El NiÃ±o,\" said Lau. But other researchers say that while the amount of atmospheric dust in 2006 was greater than in 2005, the increase may have been too insignificant to be influential on the season. Instead, they believe the atmospheric effects from the underlying El NiÃ±o pattern in 2006 likely played a greater role.Scott Braun, a hurricane specialist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, said that in 2006, El NiÃ±o brought about broad changes to atmospheric conditions that likely had at least some influence on hurricane formation across much of the Atlantic. Braun noted that during most of the hurricane season a large area of high pressure was located across the eastern Atlantic. This steered disturbances away from the warmest waters, so that they were less able to mature into tropical storms and hurricanes. At the same time, sinking motion -- an atmospheric air mass that has cooled and is falling -- combined with enhanced winds in the middle and upper atmosphere to minimize development in the Caribbean and western Atlantic and keep storms away from the U.S. These strong upper-level winds would contribute to a drastic change of winds with height, known as \"shear\" that can rip storms apart. \"This large-scale pattern has been associated with the effects of El NiÃ±o, suggesting it may have played a role in the seasonal activity,\" said Braun. \"In fact, the last time the Atlantic produced so few storms was in 1997, when an El NiÃ±o pattern was also in place.\"Braun and another hurricane researcher, Bowen Shen at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, agree that factors other than increased atmospheric dust may have contributed to cooler ocean waters in 2006.\"It is arguable that stronger surface winds over the tropical Atlantic may have cooled sea surface temperatures,\" said Shen. These winds likely helped to keep waters cooler by mixing the upper layers of the ocean and sweeping warmer waters westward. And although the waters were certainly cooler in 2006 than in 2005, they were still at or slightly above normal, suggesting other conditions helped to shape the season.Current and future research efforts that examine how the ocean responds to surface winds and dust should help clarify their role in hurricane development. Although seasonal atmospheric patterns may increase the amount of dust across the Atlantic, the same atmospheric patterns may also be responsible for creating stronger winds at the ocean surface. By modeling the oceans, winds, and dust, researchers will generate a clearer picture of how these conditions vary from season to season.\"Although we continue to make significant strides in forecasting hurricanes and understanding their development, it is important to remember that the atmosphere is a chaotic system and numerous meteorological variables influence individual storms and activity throughout the season. NASA's constellation of several Earth-observing satellites, including Aura, is designed to provide coordinated measurements of these many variables for future research,\" said Lau."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_649", "content": "Kam-biu Liu, George William Barineau III Professor in LSU's Department of Oceanography and Coastal Sciences, is the pioneer of a relatively new field of study called paleotempestology, or the study of prehistoric hurricanes. Liu, a long-time resident of Louisiana, became even more interested in the subject during the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, when a national debate was sparked concerning hurricane intensity patterns and cycles. \t\"People were discussing the probability of a Category 5 hurricane making direct impact on New Orleans,\" said Liu. \"That's tricky, because it's never actually happened in history. Even Katrina, though still extremely powerful, was only a Category 3 storm at landfall.\"  \tCurrently, experts tend to agree that Atlantic hurricane activity fluctuates in cycles of approximately 20-30 years, alternating periods of high activity with periods of relative calm. But records of such events have only been kept for the last 150 years or so. What would happen, Liu wondered, if you looked back thousands of years? Would larger cycles present themselves?  \tHow does a scientist study storms that happened during prehistoric times? \"Basically, we worked under the assumption that the storm surge from these catastrophic hurricanes would have the capability to drive sand over beach barriers and into coastal lakes,\" said Liu. \"This is called an overwash event. We believed that pulling sediment cores from coastal lakes and analyzing the sand layers might give us the information we needed.\" The same methodology can be used to find overwash sand layers in coastal marshes. Using radiocarbon analysis and other dating techniques, Liu and his research team worked to develop a chronology of prehistoric storms in order to analyze any emerging patterns or cycles. \tThis methodology has proven successful for the group. In an article printed in the March issue of American Scientist, the magazine of Sigma Xi, the Scientific Research Society, Liu states that evidence from the Gulf Coast drill sites shows that hurricanes of catastrophic magnitude directly hit each location only approximately 10 -- 12 times in the past 3,800 years. \"That means the chances of any particular Gulf location being hit by a Category 4 or Category 5 hurricane in any given year is around 0.3 percent,\" said Liu. \tAfter spending more that 15 years studying dozens of lakes and marshes along the U.S. Gulf and Atlantic Coasts, Liu and his students are moving on to a more tropical location. Liu was recently awarded more than $690,000 from the Inter-American Institute for Global Change Research, or IAI, for his new project titled \"Paleotempestology of the Caribbean Region,\" which is slated to run for five years. He serves as the principal investigator for this international and multi-disciplinary project, which involves 12 other co-investigators from four different countries, including another contributor from LSU, Nina Lam, a professor in the Department of Environmental Studies.  Institutions participating in the study include: the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, Brown University, Boston College, the University of Tennessee, the University of Toronto, the Memorial University of Newfoundland, the University of Costa Rica, and the Instituto Mexicano de Tecnologia del Agua, or IMTA, in Mexico.\tLiu's Caribbean research has attracted funding not only from the IAI but also from the U.S. National Science Foundation. He and his students have already engaged in three separate expeditions to the Caribbean, stopping in Anguilla, Barbuda and the Bahamas, in the summer and fall of 2006 to core coastal salt ponds in order to gather paleohurricane evidence for analysis. He has recently returned from a coring trip to the Mosquito Coast of Honduras, where he and his co-workers studied how Hurricane Mitch, a catastrophic hurricane that killed more than 12,000 people in Honduras and Nicaragua in 1998, impacted the local communities and environment.  His students have also conducted coring fieldwork in Barbados, Nicaragua and Belize during the past year. With many future trips to the Caribbean in the planning stages, they hope to reproduce a prehistoric hurricane analysis as successful as their Gulf Coast study."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_650", "content": "During July and August 2006, a team of international scientists, including NASA researchers, journeyed to the west coast of Africa. Their mission was to better understand why some clusters of thunderstorms that drift off the African coast, known as easterly waves, develop into furious hurricanes, while others simply fade away within hours. A major component of the campaign, called the NASA African Monsoon Multidisciplinary Analyses (NAMMA), was to study the Saharan Air Layer. The layer is a mass of very dry, dusty air that forms over the Sahara Desert and influences the development of tropical cyclones, the general name given to tropical depressions, storms and hurricanes. Budding hurricanes in the tropical Atlantic off the African coast often rapidly deteriorate when they interact with this stable air mass and its strong winds. This mission was unique because it incorporated NASA's state-of-the-art technology in space and in the air. With sophisticated satellite data and aircraft, scientists are better able to examine the \"tug-of-war\" between forces favorable for hurricane development -- warm sea surface temperatures and rotating clusters of strong thunderstorms -- and forces that suppress hurricanes such as dust particles and changing wind speed and direction at high altitudes.\"Most late-season Atlantic basin hurricanes develop from African easterly waves, so improving our knowledge of these hurricane seedlings is critical,\" said Ramesh Kakar, program manager for NAMMA at NASA headquarters. \"Several studies have shown that the Saharan Air Layer suppresses hurricane development, but the exact mechanisms are very unclear, and it remains a wild card in the list of ingredients necessary for hurricane formation.\" NASA's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer instrument on the Terra and Aqua satellites identified the location, size, and intensity of dust plumes throughout the mission. Using other satellites, scientists could then determine any possible connection between dust outbreaks and changes in tropical easterly waves. The Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission satellite, for instance, provided information on rainfall and thunderclouds, while the QuikSCAT satellite identified how low-level winds were rotating, both critical elements in hurricane formation. NASA scientists also used a satellite product designed specifically to assess the strength of the Saharan Air Layer that uses imagery from Meteosat, a European satellite. Well-developed regions of the Saharan Air Layer were easily identified by measuring tiny dust particles and atmospheric water vapor content. Multiple images taken over time tracked dust movement and evolution across the Atlantic.After analyzing satellite data, researchers flew aircraft into specific, targeted areas to probe storm clouds over a very short time and small area to learn how microscopic dust particles, called aerosols, interact with cloud droplets contained in thunderstorms. Aerosols potentially influence rainfall and the overall structure and future strength of a developing tropical cyclone. The extreme dry air, warm temperatures, and wind shear within these elevated dust layers may also weaken fledgling tropical cyclones.Scientists flew a total of 13 aircraft missions inside seven storm systems. NASA's DC-8 research aircraft contained numerous instruments to take measurements deep inside clouds, the environment of thunderstorms, and the Saharan Air Layer. Researchers also took advantage of several aircraft probes and especially dropsondes, a sensor attached to a parachute that is dropped into storm clouds. It typically collects data on wind speed and direction, temperature, humidity, and pressure that are relayed to a computer in the airplane.Aircraft sensors and laser devices called lidars measured water vapor content and cloud, dust and precipitation particle sizes, shapes, and types. Revolutionary radar on the aircraft was also used to gather better details on the intensity of rainfall and where exactly it was falling. One special sensor aboard the DC-8, called the High-Altitude MMIC Sounding Radiometer, provided a 3-D distribution of temperature and water vapor in the atmosphere. The sensor is ideal for hurricane studies since it can look through thick clouds and probe into the interior of the storms. It has also led to the development of a new microwave sounder for geostationary satellites, GeoSTAR, which will make it possible to monitor the interior of hurricanes continuously without having to wait for a satellite to pass overhead.Throughout the field mission, a Web-based real time mission monitor, developed by Marshall Space Flight Center, allowed scientists to track the progress of the experiment from anywhere on the globe using a standard internet connection.\"Through the use of sophisticated technology, NAMMA provided an excellent opportunity to advance our understanding of tropical cyclones, as we gathered data on the critical elements at both the very small and large scales, from microscopic dust to air currents spanning hundreds of miles,\" said Jeff Halverson, one of four NAMMA mission scientists. \"Much of the data gathered is still being analyzed, but the preliminary findings are very promising.\"As researchers study the data collected, and input them into computer models, they will test hypotheses surrounding tropical cyclone formation in the Atlantic. NASA scientists will also compare NAMMA findings to data from previous missions that took place in the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico. The results should help determine the role of factors universal to hurricane formation and those uniquely dependent on location, such as the Saharan Air Layer in the eastern Atlantic and tall mountains in Central America. Ultimately, research findings will improve the group of computer models that help meteorologists forecast hurricane strength and intensity.Other scientists will be using NAMMA data for a variety of related research goals, including advancing the understanding of precipitation and cloud microphysics, examining the link between tropical cyclone development and West Africa rainfall, and assessing the accuracy of new satellites."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_651", "content": "Hurricanes can gain or lose intensity with startling quickness, a phenomenon never more obvious than during the historic 2005 hurricane season that spawned the remarkably destructive Katrina and Rita.\tResearchers flew through Rita, Katrina and other 2005 storms trying to unlock the key to intensity changes. Now, data from Rita is providing the first documented evidence that such intensity changes can be caused by clouds outside the wall of a hurricane's eye coming together to form a new eyewall.\t\"The comparison between Katrina and Rita will be interesting because we got excellent data from both storms. Rita was the one that showed the eyewall replacement,\" said Robert Houze Jr., a University of Washington atmospheric sciences professor and lead author of a paper detailing the work in the March 2 edition of the journal Science.\t\"The implication of our findings is that some new approaches to hurricane forecasting might be possible,\" he said.\tHouze and Shuyi Chen, an associate professor of meteorology and physical oceanography at the University of Miami Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science, lead a scientific collaboration called the Hurricane Rainband and Intensity Change Experiment. The project is designed to reveal how the outer rainbands interact with a hurricane's eye to influence the storm's intensity. Chen is a co-author of the Science paper, as are Bradley Smull of the UW and Wen-Chau Lee and Michael Bell of the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo.\tThe project is the first to use three Doppler radar-equipped aircraft flying simultaneously in and near hurricane rainbands. The project also uses a unique computer model developed by Chen's group at the Rosenstiel School.\t\"The model provided an exceptionally accurate forecast of eyewall replacement, which was key to guiding the aircraft to collect the radar data,\" Chen said.\tA hurricane's strongest winds occur in the wall of clouds surrounding the calm eye. The researchers found that as the storm swirled into a tighter spin, a band of dry air developed around the eyewall, like a moat around a castle. But while a moat protects a castle, the hurricane's moat eventually will destroy the existing eyewall, Houze said. Meanwhile, outer rainbands form a new eyewall and the moat merges with the original eye and the storm widens, so the spin is reduced and winds around the eye are slowed temporarily, something like what happens as a figure skater's arms are extended. But the storm soon intensifies again as the new eyewall takes shape.\t\"The exciting thing about the data from Rita is that they show that the moat is a very dynamic region that cuts off the old eye and establishes a wider eye,\" Houze said. \"It's not just a passive region that's caught in between two eyewalls.\"\tHurricane forecasters in recent years have developed remarkable accuracy in figuring out hours, even days, ahead of time what path a storm is most likely to follow. But they have been unable to say with much certainty how strong the storm will be when it hits land. This work could provide the tools they need to understand when a storm is going to change intensity and how strong it will become.\tScientists already knew that intensity can change greatly in a short time -- in the case of Rita the storm grew from a category 1, the least powerful hurricane, to a category 5, the most powerful, in less than a day. Aircraft observation of the moat allowed scientists to see Rita's rapid loss of intensity during eyewall replacement, which was followed by rapid intensification.\t\"Future aircraft observations focused in the same way should make it possible to identify other small-scale areas in a storm where the processes that affect intensity are going on, then that data can be fed into high-resolution models to forecast storm intensity changes,\" Houze said.\tThat understanding could prove valuable for coastal residents deciding whether a storm is powerful enough to warrant their seeking safety farther inland. Rita and Katrina, among the six most intense Atlantic hurricanes ever recorded in terms of the barometric pressure within the core of the storm, struck just three weeks apart in August and September 2005, together resulting in some 2,000 fatalities and more than $90 billion in damage along the Gulf of Mexico coastline. The most-intense Atlantic storm ever recorded, Wilma, also struck in the record-setting 2005 hurricane season, which produced 15 hurricanes, including a fourth category 5 storm, Emily, and a category 4 storm, Dennis.\tThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration provided two research aircraft for the project and the third was provided by the U.S. Navy and funded by the National Science Foundation.\tThe planes flew several novel flight paths, including a circular track in Rita's moat, to gather information from the edges of rainbands and other structures in the hurricane.\t\"We used a ground-control system with a lot of data at our fingertips to focus the aircraft into places in the storm where there were processes happening related to intensity changes,\" Houze said."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_652", "content": "Moore, chair of the chemical and physical sciences, headed to Greenland Feb. 18 as part of the Greenland Flow Distortion experiment (GFDex), an International Polar Year research project involving Canadian, British, Norwegian and Icelandic scientists. Moore, a professor of atmospheric physics, is leading the Canadian contingent.GFDex will provide the first evidence of the role that Greenland plays in distorting atmospheric flow around its massive land and ice mass, affecting European and Asian weather systems. Moreover, the findings may reveal how sea and atmospheric interactions in the Arctic and North Atlantic areas influence climate.At the heart of GFDex are wind patterns known as âtip jets.â Greenland, an icy obstacle more than three times the size of Texas, forces air to go around its bulk and creates regions of high wind speeds. Tip jets travel east from the tip of Greenland towards Iceland at speeds of 30 to 40 metres per second. Just as wind blows heat away from the body, making windy winter days feel even colder, tip jets blow heat away from the surface of the ocean. This cooler, denser water sinks, affecting currents of circulating warm and cool water within the ocean.About two years ago, Moore discovered a different kind of tip jet, one that blows west towards Labrador. Now known as reverse tip jets, these also force circulation of water over the Labrador Sea to the west of Greenland. âWeâve seen these things in satellite imagery but no oneâs ever actually observed them,â Moore said. âWeâll be making the first in situ observations of these jets. Itâs kind of exciting.âThe data will help scientists understand how the flow of air around Greenland affects weather downwind. âIf things are happening near Greenland today, probably two days from now that [air mass] will move down over Europe,â said Moore. âTwo or three days after itâs affected Europe, it affects Asia and then ultimately comes around and affects North America. So Greenland ultimately affects the whole Northern Hemisphere â¦ our knowledge will potentially help improve forecasts.âMoore is also hoping the findings will clarify the climate processes affecting Greenlandâs glaciers, which have shrunk significantly in the past few years. âThereâs evidence that the ice cap is retreating quite dramatically. In 2003, a cyclone came up on the east side of Greenland and there was a huge melting event,â Moore said. âItâs one of my hopes that weâll be able to understand a bit more about the processes that determine the mass balance of the Greenland ice cap.âMaking these observations requires both advanced technology and a cast-iron stomach. Moore and his colleagues, along with graduate students and post-doctoral fellows, will be making 17 flights into the tip jets in a British research aircraft called FAAM (facility for airborne atmospheric measurements). Pods and sensors stud the outside of the aircraft. In order to get the best data, the researchers need to fly just 100 feet above the heaving seas, in winds of more than 140 kilometres per hour. âIn these conditions and at these levels, the turbulence will be quite severe,â Moore said. âOnce, on a similar flight in the Arctic, the lens of my glasses popped out!â"}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_653", "content": "The unsettling trend is confined to the Atlantic, however, and does not hold up in any of the world's other oceans, researchers have also found. \tScientists at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported the finding in the journal Geophysical Research Letters. The work should help resolve some of the controversy that has swirled around two prominent studies that drew connections last year between global warming and the onset of increasingly intense hurricanes. \t\"The debate is not about scientific methods, but instead centers around the quality of hurricane data,\" says lead author James Kossin, a research scientist at UW-Madison's Cooperative Institute for Meteorological Satellite Studies. \"So we thought, 'Lets take the first step toward resolving this debate.'\" \tThe inconsistent nature of hurricane data has been a sore spot within the hurricane research community for decades. Before the advent of weather satellites, scientists were forced to rely on scattered ship reports and sailor logs to stay abreast of storm conditions. The advent of weather satellites during the 1960s dramatically improved the situation, but the technology has changed so rapidly that newer satellite records are barely consistent with older ones. \tKossin and his colleagues realized they needed to smooth out the data before exploring any interplay between warmer temperatures and hurricane activity. Working with an existing NCDC archive that holds global satellite information for the years 1983 through 2005, the researchers evened out the numbers by essentially simplifying newer satellite information to align it with older records. \t\"This new dataset is unlike anything that's been done before,\" says Kossin. \"It's going to serve a purpose as being the only globally consistent dataset around. The caveat of course, is that it only goes back to 1983.\" \tEven so, it's a good start. Once the NCDC researchers recalibrated the hurricane figures, Kossin took a fresh look at how the new numbers on hurricane strength correlate with records on warming ocean temperatures, a side effect of global warming. \tWhat he found both supported and contradicted previous findings. \"The data says that the Atlantic has been trending upwards in hurricane intensity quite a bit,\" says Kossin. \"But the trends appear to be inflated or spurious everywhere else, meaning that we still can't make any global statements.\" \tSea-surface temperatures may be one reason why greenhouse gases are exacting a unique toll on the Atlantic Ocean, says Kossin. Hurricanes need temperatures of around 27 degrees Celsius (81 degrees Fahrenheit) to gather steam. On average, the Atlantic's surface is slightly colder than that but other oceans, such as the Western Pacific, are naturally much warmer. \t\"The average conditions in the Atlantic at any given time are just on the cusp of what it takes for a hurricane to form,\" says Kossin. \" So it might be that imposing only a small (man-made) change in conditions, creates a much better chance of having a hurricane.\" \tThe Atlantic is also unique in that all the physical variables that converge to form hurricanes -- including wind speeds, wind directions and temperatures -- mysteriously feed off each other in ways that only make conditions more ripe for a storm. But scientists don't really understand why, Kossin adds. \t\"While we can see a correlation between global warming and hurricane strength, we still need to understand exactly why the Atlantic is reacting to warmer temperatures in this way, and that is much more difficult to do,\" says Kossin. \"We need to be creating models and simulations to understand what is really happening here.

{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_655", "content": "An international team of climate scientists led by the University of East Anglia will measure for the first time the influence of the atmosphere over Greenland and Iceland on the weather in Northern Europe.The mountainous region at the southern tip of Greenland produces hurricane-strength 'tip jets', 'barrier winds' and 'mesoscale cyclones' which 'force' the overturning of the ocean. The atmosphere here also impacts on weather downstream in the UK some three to four days later. The experiment will make detailed measurements of weather features that are influenced by the flow around Greenland. For example, small cyclones known as 'polar lows' can sometimes produce heavy snow in North-West Europe.The pioneering research led by Dr Ian Renfrew of UEA's School of Environmental Sciences comes at the start of the International Polar Year which begins on March 1 and is launched in the UK by HRH the Princess Royal on Feb 26.  \"In Britain we tend to view medium-range weather forecasts with a certain scepticism, so it is very exciting to be part of a project which could significantly improve their accuracy,\" said Dr Renfrew.\"Though we have suspected for several years that the mountainous presence of Greenland has a strong influence over our own weather, this will be the first time that its impact has been observed.\"This will be the first time that this area has been targeted with additional meteorological observations aimed at improving subsequent weather forecasts.  Richard Swinbank, who is leading the Met Office team, said: \"We will identify areas where additional targeted observations should be particularly beneficial, and afterwards we will check the benefit that the extra observations had on our forecasts.\"The intention is that this targeting will help to improve forecast quality during the experiment, and also help with designing the observational networks of the future.As well as improving predictions of UK weather, the research will also fill in missing gaps in the existing climate change models, such as those used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in its major report on February 2. This will help to improve both the accuracy and the long-term range of climate change predictions.From February 21 to March 10 the researchers will take to the skies over Greenland in a specially adapted aircraft, supplied by the Facility for Airborne Atmospheric Measurements (FAAM), to conduct the Greenland Flow Distortion Experiment (GFDex) experiment.

{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_656", "content": "Although hurricane cycles still remain somewhat of a mystery that scientists are trying to solve, the general ingredients of what causes a hurricane to form are relatively well known. You need the winds to behave correctly, sea surface temperatures of at least 82 degrees Fahrenheit, and no interference from African dust, among other things.The Atlantic hurricane season ended on Nov. 30, and wound up having near-normal activity with nine named storms, including five hurricanes, two of which became major hurricanes of Category 3 strength or higher. An average Atlantic season has 11 named storms, with six growing into hurricanes and two becoming major hurricanes. Unlike the past three years, in 2006, the stronger hurricanes stayed at sea.In 2006, there were several factors that reduced the number of Atlantic Ocean storms from forming compared to 2005, while the eastern Pacific still saw 25 storms develop in 2006. In 2006, the Atlantic factors included lower sea-surface temperatures, the switch from weak La Nina to weak El NiÃ±o conditions and changes in the large-scale steering flow of winds associated with the Bermuda High (a semi-permanent high pressure system near Bermuda in the Atlantic that moves storms around it in a clockwise motion). Persistent low-level easterly winds may have acted to keep the Atlantic Ocean sea surface temperatures lower through mixing of the upper ocean. When winds blow constantly, they push the warmer waters away, allowing cooler, deeper waters to come to the surface, keeping the ocean's surface cooler.This past year, the Bermuda High steered systems away from the U.S. by steering them northward into the cooler waters of the Central Atlantic Ocean instead of into the warmer waters of the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico as it did to storms in 2004 and 2005. While dust activity from Africa was somewhat greater than in 2005, it probably played a much smaller role than these other factors.Scott Braun, hurricane specialist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Md. noted that the sea surface temperatures in the Atlantic Ocean were much closer to normal this year, and considerably cooler than last year. \"Sea surface temperatures in the Atlantic were unusually warm in 2005,\" Braun said. \"Sea-surface temperature data from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite showed that ocean temperatures were up to two degrees warmer in 2005. TRMM observed surface winds were persistently strong over the tropical Atlantic in 2006 while in 2005 they were somewhat weaker and more variable. The stronger winds in 2006 likely helped to keep temperatures cooler by mixing the upper layer of the ocean.\" The persistent winds were a key in keeping the Atlantic waters cooler than they were in 2005. As the winds kept blowing, they swept the warmer water west, and it was replaced by cooler waters from below the surface. Hurricanes need warm waters of at least 82 degrees Fahrenheit to form and strengthen. The winds prevented those warmer conditions from happening. In addition, Braun noted that those winds may have also been indicative of strong vertical winds called \"shear\" that rip storms apart.The Bermuda High is a fairly stationary high-pressure system that sits near Bermuda in the western Atlantic Ocean. Surface high pressure develops when air is being forced down from above. That prevents the formation of storms and usually brings sunshine to an area that sits underneath it. However, the \"Bermuda High\" is always strong enough to act as a guide for the path hurricanes take when they move from the eastern Atlantic and head west toward the Caribbean and the U.S. and storms go around it in a clock-wise direction.The position and the size of the Bermuda High is a key to where storms will go. In 2004 and 2005 the Bermuda High was situated more to west-southwest, so it steered systems west into the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico's warmer waters. The warmer waters fueled the storms and strengthened many storms including Katrina, Rita and Wilma in 2005. This year, 2006, the Bermuda High was smaller and shifted to the eastern Atlantic, so it turned storms like Florence, Gordon, Helene and Isaac north into cooler waters of the central Atlantic, and directed them eastward into colder waters in the North Atlantic Ocean.The current El NiÃ±o started developing in July, 2006. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) scientists said that this hurricane season's activity was lower than expected due to the rapid development of El NiÃ±oâa periodic warming of the ocean waters in the central and eastern equatorial Pacific, which influences pressure and wind patterns across the tropical Atlantic.NOAA scientists noted that the El NiÃ±o produced a sinking motion in the middle and upper atmosphere and increased wind shear in the Caribbean. Those conditions minimized thunderstorm activity from the western coast of Africa across the Atlantic to the Caribbean, and suppressed tropical storm formation. They also believe that a strong low pressure system with enhanced westerly winds in the jet stream across the eastern U.S. helped to steer hurricanes out to sea.Oceanographer Bill Patzert, of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif. said \"Forecasting the hurricane season in the spring is a high-risk business. This is because much can happen during the summer. Over the summer of 2006, a late-developing, modest El NiÃ±o arrived to shift upper level winds. Over the past few decades these forecasts have really improved, but there is still much we don't understand about these great storms. Looking to the future, NASA and NOAA scientists are on the case and, I'm confident that more reliable forecasts are in our near future.\"African dust was found to \"contaminate\" several fledgling storm systems emerging off western Africa, according to Jeffrey Halverson, research meteorologist at the University of Baltimore County, Baltimore. Halverson participated in the NASA African Monsoon Multidisciplinary Analyses (NAMMA) hurricane research mission in the Cape Verde Islands off Africa's west coast this past summer. During the mission scientists from NASA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and universities looked at how African dust affects storms.Data from NASA's Moderate Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) that flies aboard NASA's Terra and Aqua satellites revealed that both 2006 and 2005 had active dust storm seasons. Although 2006 was somewhat more active, and the dust played more of a role in whether or not individual storms were able to intensify, rather than limiting the overall number of storms that formed during the entire season. The dust plumes contain very dry air, and also had high wind shear (winds that blow storms apart). Both of these factors knock the proverbial wind out of a storm's sails. Halverson said that out of the 12 or so seedling storms coming off the African west coast several had a veil of dust associated with them, which hindered their development.The African dust storms happen because there's a big temperature difference over the continent, between the tropical, moist, vegetated areas in the south and the very hot, dry desert in the north. That actually helps to create some of these dust storms which can be the size of the continental U.S. and as much as 3 miles high into the atmosphere.Although the Atlantic Ocean had a near normal hurricane season in 2006, the eastern Pacific had a greater number of named storms than occurred in 2005, and more of them made landfall in Mexico.Braun said that the steering currents in the eastern Pacific were responsible for bringing several storms into Mexico in 2006. \"Normally in any given year, there is some percentage of storms that turn northward into Mexico,\" he said. \"In 2005 there were 17 storms in the Eastern Pacific, while in 2006 there were 25 storms, so there was a greater chance for more storms to steer into Mexico this year.\"Carlotta, John and Paul were three of the Eastern Pacific storms that affected Mexico in the 2006 season. Carlotta was a category 1 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. She brought modest coastal rains but otherwise did not affect land. Hurricane John struck southern Baja California as a category 2 hurricane and was responsible for five deaths.Hurricane Paul was a category two hurricane over the open waters of the eastern North Pacific. Paul weakened to a tropical storm as it passed south of Baja California, then made landfall along the coast of mainland Mexico near the southern end of Isla Altamura and later dissipated inland over mainland Mexico. Paul caused significant rainfall and floods in the Mexican state of Sinaloa and was responsible for four deaths.The primary factors that made 2006 so different from 2006 were changes in sea surface temperatures in the Atlantic Ocean, the developing El NiÃ±o and changes in large-scale winds like the Bermuda High. African dust is being intensively investigated and is thought to be a secondary factor that mostly affected the strengthening of storms.Although the Atlantic Ocean experienced a much calmer hurricane season in 2006 than it did in 2005, some of the factors that made it that way may or may not be in place during the 2007 season, and NASA scientists will be keeping a close eye on the Atlantic."}

The hurricane special edition was published as the journal's December 2006 issue.The impetus for the special issue was the intense 2004 hurricane season, in which four major hurricanes made landfall in Florida within a three-month period, according to Holly Greening of the Tampa Bay Estuary Program, one of the guest editors for the special issue. \"One surprising conclusion that can be drawn from this collection of research is that natural systems are actually quite resilient in the face of these storms. While hurricanes often wreak havoc with human systems and infrastructure, many of the habitats and organisms studied rebounded quite well in the weeks and months following the 2004 storms,\" said Greening. \"This special issue compiles research findings and results of long-term monitoring to give us a chance to look at these large, anomalous storms in the context of long-term trends,\" she added. The papers in the journal explore both the individual and cumulative effects of storms on coastal environments, animals, and plants, and examine the effect of these storms on coastal management. For example, water quality and phytoplankton productivity -- a measure of the health of the base of the food web -- were impacted by winds and heavy rainfall, but returned to normal within months. One study found that manatees' storm-induced movements away from their home ranges were much smaller than expected. Aquatic plants, referred to as submerged aquatic vegetation or SAV, had a more variable response to hurricane-induced stress, sometimes rebounding and sometimes exhibiting long-term damage.Damage to shoreline ecosystems varied as well. Dune erosion due to hurricanes was severe in some places but not others. In some parts of coastal Louisiana, large sections of wetlands were lost in extreme storm events.\"A major research goal is to use these unique data sets to develop and test a new hurricane scale for predicting the coastal impacts of extreme storms,\" noted issue  contributor Abby Sallenger of the St. Petersburg, FL, office of the U.S. Geological Survey.These varying impacts seemed to depend, at least in part, on the characteristics of the storms themselves: direction and speed of approach, point of landfall, and intensity all made a difference in the extent of environmental damage. Storms that carried more  rainfall seemed to do more long-term damage than \"hit-and-run\" storms with higher winds.\"The research compiled in this issue of Estuaries and Coasts is an excellent start in understanding the environmental impacts of these storms,\" said Greening, \"but many questions still need to be answered. We still need to know how storm frequency and intensity, both predicted to increase in the coming years, interact to impact coastal environments and communities. Another outstanding question is the extent to which human alteration of the shoreline determines the coast's resiliency to storms.\"Scientists and managers contributing to the special issue represent more than 25 institutions, including the University of Florida, the University of North Carolina, the US Geological Survey, Alabama's Dauphin Island Sea Lab, and a host of local governments.

While the method cleans the water, it doesn't yet make the water drinkable. However, the method may eventually prove critical for limiting the spread of disease at disaster sites around the world.National Science Foundation-funded researchers Vishal Shah and Shreya Shah of Dowling College in Long Island, New York, collaborated with Boris Dzikovski of Cornell University and Jose Pinto of New York's Polytechnic University in Brooklyn to develop the technique. They will publish their findings in Environmental Pollution.\"After the disaster of Hurricane Katrina, scientists have had their backs against the wall trying to develop safeguards,\" said Shah. \"No one knows when a similar situation may arise. We need to develop a treatment for decontaminating flood water before it either comes in contact with humans or is pumped into natural reservoirs.\"The treatment system that the researchers are developing is simple: a polymer sheet of resins containing copper is immersed in the contaminated flood water. The addition of hydrogen peroxide generates free radicals on the polymer. The free radicals remain bound to the sheet, where they come in contact with bacteria and kill them.The researchers are working to lower the amount of copper in the treated water end product and improving the system's impact on chemical toxins. Shah believes it could be ready for emergency use within five to seven years.To develop their process, the researchers built upon a century-old chemical mechanism called the Fenton reaction - a process wherein metal catalysts cause hydrogen peroxide to produce large numbers of free radicals.Free radicals are atoms or molecules that have an extra electron in dire need of a partner (they obtain the partner by stripping it from a nearby atom, damaging the \"victim\" in the process). In large quantities, the radicals can destroy toxic chemicals and even bombard bacteria to death or irreparably damage a microorganism's cell membrane.Applying their technique to water from the Industrial and 17th Street canals in New Orleans, the researchers were able to destroy all of the bacteria within 15 minutes. In tests with laboratory water samples containing even higher bacterial concentrations, the exact same process killed at least 99 percent of the bacteria in 90 minutes.The National Science Foundation (NSF) is an independent federal agency that supports fundamental research and education across all fields of science and engineering, with an annual budget of $5.58 billion.

{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_659", "content": "The set of six microsatellites, launched in April, is probing the atmosphere in ways that have been impossible with previous observing systems. Dubbed COSMIC (Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere and Climate), the system is based on a design provided by the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR).Initial results show that the system's unique global coverage provides unprecedented information on the atmosphere's temperature and water vapor structure. Moreover, COSMIC data can be collected above hard-to-reach locations, such as Antarctica and the remote Pacific, which could greatly enhance the global-scale monitoring needed to analyze climate change.\"COSMIC may well be the most accurate, precise, and stable thermometer for measuring global and regional climate change,\" says UCAR president Richard Anthes. \"COSMIC can see through cloud cover and gather highly accurate data through many levels of the atmosphere.\"COSMIC works by tracking tiny changes in the speed of GPS radio signals. Using these data, scientists can now produce vertical profiles of temperature and water vapor at more than 1,000 points over Earth each day, sampling the troposphere (the atmosphere's \"weather layer,\" closest to Earthâs surface) and the stratosphere. By next year, some 2,500 profiles will be produced daily. Higher up, the system measures electron density in the ionosphere, an important observation for space-weather analysis and forecasting.In a test at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), scientists added COSMIC data to the other weather observations used to kick-start computer forecast models. With the help of COSMIC data, stratospheric temperature forecasts over the Northern Hemisphere improve significantly.Predictions of hurricanes and typhoons also stand to benefit from COSMIC. A test involving one of the main U.S. forecast models found that the model was able to predict the birth of this year's Hurricane Ernesto two days in advance with COSMIC data. Without the data, the model was unable to predict Ernesto's formation. Tests in Taiwan this year involving Tropical Storm Bilis and other cyclones showed that COSMIC data can reduce errors in track prediction.In Antarctica, weather forecasts that are vital to international research outposts and other activities should improve, thanks to the wealth and quality of data available through COSMIC. Radiosondes sent aloft by balloons only provide a dozen or so profiles each day above this sparsely populated region, but COSMIC provides hundreds of profiles.\"With COSMIC, Antarctica is no longer a data-void region,\" says Ying-Hwa \"Bill\" Kuo, director of COSMIC in UCAR's Office of Programs. \"After only a few months, we see strengths and weaknesses in the forecast models that we really have had no way of seeing before.\"COSMIC data will also help scientists measure and predict the density of high-altitude electrons associated with damaging solar storms. The altitudes of peak electron density have been difficult to observe and predict, because forecast models have had limited data on the vertical distribution of electrons. \"The many thousands of vertical profiles that COSMIC can provide each day on electron density will be extremely useful in correcting the space weather models and their predictions,\" says COSMIC chief scientist Christian Rocken.The $100 million COSMIC network is the product of an agreement between the American Institute in Taiwan and the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office in the United States. COSMIC is known as FORMOSAT-3 in Taiwan. U.S. support for COSMIC is provided by the National Science Foundation, NASA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and the Office of Naval Research.

{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_660", "content": "If the seawalls at Den Haag and Ter Heijde are breached and the fast-flowing seawater floods the polder land behind the dikes, there will be more than 4,000 casualties, according to a new calculation method devised by TU Delft PhD candidate Bas Jonkman.Jonkman's method also reveals that evacuating this area would only save at most 600 lives. \"It's possible to predict a North Sea storm a day or two in advance,\" Jonkman says. 'But before an evacuation could begin, the government would deliberate and everyone would have to be warned. Then, people would pack up their belongings. All this would cost a lot of time.\"However, in the less densely populated polder lands along the rivers, if people were warned well enough in advance of an impending flood, Jonkman's model predicts that an evacuation would indeed save many lives. For the densely populated polders bordering the coastline, Jonkman says it would be more effective for example to build stronger and higher dikes, as this would reduce the likelihood of a flood.Â Until now, various rules of thumb have been used to estimate the number of possible casualties resulting from a flood. Jonkman's model for estimating casualties is more precise. It consists of various parts, including a model that simulates an evacuation and thereby determines how many people would still be in the area if the dike were breached. Determining how many of these people would survive is dependent on how fast the water flows, how fast the water rises and how deep the water is. To make such predictions, Jonkman uses a model that was developed by TU Delft and the research institute WL Delft Hydraulics. Jonkman combined the models to simulate the evacuation and the course of the flood.The majority of Jonkman's doctoral research was devoted to devising the so-called 'victim functions'. 'If the water is four meters deep, then 20 percent of the people in that area would not survive', is an example of how this function works. For the victim functions, Jonkman based his data on the calamitous flood in the Netherlands in 1953 and other such disasters. To determine if his model's findings were realistic, Jonkman also processed data from the floods caused by Hurricane Katrina in August 2005, when the dikes protecting New Orleans were breached. Jonkman's model calculated 2,000 victims for that disaster â a figure that Jonkman is pleased with: \"This is of the same order of magnitude as the 1,100 bodies that have actually been recovered so far.\"An in-depth article about this research subject has been published in the latest edition of Delft Integraal / Delft Outlook, the independent science magazine of TU Delft.

{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_661", "content": "They found that a burst of rapidly rising air (convection), a weak wind shear (winds that vary with height that can blow a storm apart), and the ocean surface temperature all played an important role in Tropical Storm Gert's origination and strengthening.In July 2005, during the Tropical Cloud Systems and Processes (TCSP) mission field experiments, scientists from NASA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and universities boarded hurricane research planes and flew over and into Tropical Storm Gert near eastern Mexico. From the aircraft they dropped sensors called \"dropsondes\" into the storm. They also observed Gert by satellite and ran computer models with the data they gathered from the dropsondes and satellites to re-create the storm inside and outside.Zhaoxia Pu, assistant professor in the Department of Meteorology at the University of Utah, led the study. \"By recreating the storm on a computer model as a four-dimensional structure -- height, width, depth and over time -- it will help us understand the mechanisms of storm development,\" Pu said. Xuanli Li, a graduate student at University of Utah, and Pu conducted a study to identify the factors that affect the storm's development.In addition to the dropsonde information, they used satellite data from NASA's QuikSCAT satellite for winds; the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite data on precipitation; and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) for movement of the atmosphere, into a computer model. Their purpose was to produce a very detailed view in both space and time of the evolution of tropical storm Gert throughout its life cycle. Tropical storms and hurricanes travel over large areas during their life cycle and are influenced by many factors. With the computer simulation of Gert, scientists are getting a much more detailed look at what may lead to those changes, whether it's a change in air temperature or the direction or strength winds are blowing at different levels of the atmosphere. \"By combining the satellite and dropsonde data and creating high-resolution computer model simulations, we were able to reveal the major structural features as they evolved  in Gert,\" said Li. \"The computer simulation accurately captured the rapid increase in the upward motion of the air (convection) inside Gert when the storm strengthened from a tropical depression to a tropical storm.\" said Li. \"We expect that our understanding of tropical storm development will be improved through these types of comprehensive datasets obtained from field observations and high-resolution computer model analysis,\" said Edward Zipser, a co-author and lead scientist on NASA's African Monsoon Multidisciplinary Activities (NAMMA) 2006 Atlantic Ocean hurricane mission. Gert began as a low pressure area that formed in the Gulf of Honduras just east of Chetumal, Mexico on July 22. The low quickly moved inland over Yucatan and organized into a tropical depression on July 23. The next day, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Gert. The computer model re-created Gert's life cycle from July 22 to July 25."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_662", "content": "While meteorologists have made considerable strides in forecasting a hurricane's track, intensity predictions have remained a more elusive challenge. Part of the difficulty is that the many factors that control intensity, particularly the speed, direction and spin of air throughout the atmosphere, are constantly changing and tricky to measure. Aircraft are able to gather detailed, precise measurements of winds in a hurricane that can help researchers understand what is going on inside the storm, allowing better forecasts to be made.\tIn July 2005, Hurricane Dennis experienced several periods of rapid intensity fluctuations, providing for several excellent opportunities to learn about tropical cyclone behavior. Dennis reached hurricane strength on July 7, 2005, in the eastern Caribbean Sea, and rapidly strengthened into a category 4 storm before making landfall in Cuba on July 8. After weakening considerably as the storm moved over Cuba, Dennis attained category 4 hurricane status again with a pressure drop of 11 millibars in under two hours, indicative of rapid intensification. A typical low-pressure system in the United States might intensify that much over the course of an entire day. \tFlying over Hurricane Dennis with NASA's ER-2 aircraft and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) P-3 aircraft, scientists gathered data on the storm's internal structure, including the distribution of winds, rainfall, temperature and moisture. The aircraft information has provided insight into the evolution of a hurricane's warm inner core; one of the many factors that impact storm development.\tThe research flights were conducted as part of the Tropical Cloud Systems and Processes (TCSP) mission in Costa Rica, a NASA field experiment with cooperative participation from NOAA and several universities. This experiment was aimed at studying the birthing conditions for tropical storms and hurricanes and identifying the factors that cause them to strengthen or weaken.\t\"This campaign was particularly unique because two types of aircraft provided measurements on different atmospheric variables,\" said Joe Turk of the Naval Research Laboratory, Monterey, Calif. \"The information is also being used to determine how accurately satellites capture storm details.\" \tThe aircraft data provide high resolution measurements with a level of detail far superior to current weather satellites. During the mission, the NASA ER-2 aircraft flew over Dennis at 65,000 feet while taking scientific measurements that probed downward through the cloud layers. At times, the NOAA P-3 flew identical and coordinated patterns, but from an altitude of 12,000 feet, probing the storm from the inside. \tAs the hurricane fluctuated in intensity, flights into the storm continued, taking critical measurements of wind, temperature, and moisture. \"The erratic nature of the storm and the timing of the research mission allowed scientists to pierce through the core of the hurricane at many stages of its life cycle and for the first time map a hurricane's entire evolution,\" said Steve Guimond of Florida State University, Tallahassee, Fla.\tNASA's ER-2 Doppler radar measured wind speed along the track of the aircraft including measurements indicative of the size and concentration of raindrops and ice particles, while another ER-2 instrument, the Advanced Microwave Precipitation Radiometer, gathered microwave imagery of the internal structure of rain clouds. By analyzing when and where strong winds are occurring, researchers can better determine when intensity changes may occur. Data on the storm's vertical temperature structure - indirectly related to wind speed and rainfall - was also examined from overpasses of NASA and NOAA satellites.\tThese key aircraft observations not only assist in understanding the rapid intensification of hurricanes, they can also help scientists recreate storms on computer models that are used in forecasting. Just small changes in wind speed and direction patterns can significantly rearrange a storm's rain and wind structure, altering the evolution of its predicted track and intensity.\tPrevious research has suggested that rapid hurricane intensification, like that seen in Dennis, is associated with \"hot towers.\" These are columns of rapidly rising air that reach and in some cases overshoot the top of the troposphere - the lowest layer of the atmosphere - about nine miles high in the tropics. They are called \"hot\" because of the large amount of heat they release through condensation of water vapor, providing fuel for strong winds and heavy rainfall.\t\"With Dennis, it appears the hot towers played a major role in the rapid intensification of the storm, giving clues on how energy is concentrated and winds evolve at various stages of development,\" said Guimond. \"The observations also helped place the storm's behavior in greater context and matched well with computer model simulations, suggesting that we are making progress in replicating hurricane development.\" \t\"Improved knowledge of how both the heating and rotation or 'spin' of air parcels associated with these hot towers interacts with the greater organized system is thought to be another key ingredient to improving hurricane intensity forecasts,\" said Steve Miller of the Naval Research Laboratory. \"While our preliminary findings based on satellite views of Dennis support the idea that such physical links may in fact exist, additional insight requires the kind of three-dimensional detailed perspective on internal storm structure that is only available in a field experiment, such as the TCSP mission.\"\tAs researchers identify other factors most critical in hurricane development, those elements can be targeted for increased observation in future field missions to obtain the big pieces of the puzzle needed to solve the mysteries of hurricane behavior."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_663", "content": "Averaged separately for both hemispheres, 2006 surface temperatures for the northern hemisphere (0.58Â°C above 30-year mean of 14.6Â°C/58.28Â°F) are likely to be the fourth warmest and for the southern hemisphere (0.26Â°C above 30-year mean of 13.4Â°C/56.12Â°F), the seventh warmest in the instrumental record from 1861 to the present.Since the start of the 20th century, the global average surface temperature has risen approximately 0.7Â°C. But this rise has not been continuous. Since 1976, the global average temperature has risen sharply, at 0.18Â°C per decade. In the northern and southern hemispheres, the period 1997-2006 averaged 0.53Â°C and 0.27Â°C above the 1961-1990 mean, respectively.The beginning of 2006 was unusually mild in large parts of North America and the western European Arctic islands, though there were harsh winter conditions in Asia, the Russian Federation and parts of eastern Europe. Canada experienced its mildest winter and spring on record, the USA its warmest January-September on record and the monthly temperatures in the Arctic island of Spitsbergen (Svalbard Lufthavn) for January and April included new highs with anomalies of +12.6Â°C and +12.2Â°C, respectively.Persistent extreme heat affected much of eastern Australia from late December 2005 until early March with many records being set (e.g. second hottest day on record in Sydney with 44.2Â°C/111.6Â°F on 1 January). Spring 2006 (September-November) was Australia's warmest since seasonal records were first compiled in 1950. Heat waves were also registered in Brazil from January until March (e.g. 44.6Â°C/112.3Â°F in Bom Jesus on 31 January -- one of the highest temperatures ever recorded in Brazil).Several parts of Europe and the USA experienced heat waves with record temperatures in July and August. Air temperatures in many parts of the USA reached 40Â°C/104Â°F or more. The July European-average land-surface air temperature was the warmest on record at 2.7Â°C above the climatological normal.Autumn 2006 (September-November) was exceptional in large parts of Europe at more than 3Â°C warmer than the climatological normal from the north side of the Alps to southern Norway. In many countries it was the warmest autumn since official measurements began: records in central England go back to 1659 (1706 in The Netherlands and 1768 in Denmark).Long-term drought continued in parts of the Greater Horn of Africa including parts of Burundi, Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, and the United Republic of Tanzania. At least 11 million people were affected by food shortages; Somalia was hit by the worst drought in a decade.For many areas in Australia, the lack of adequate rainfall in 2006 added to significant longer-term dry conditions, with large regions having experienced little recovery from the droughts of 2002-2003 and 1997-1998. Dry conditions have now persisted for 5 to 10 years in some areas and in south-west Western Australia for around 30 years.Across the USA, moderate-to-exceptional drought persisted throughout parts of the south-west desert and eastward through the southern plains, also developing in areas west of the Great Lakes. Drought and anomalous warmth contributed to a record wildfire season for the USA, with more than 3.8 million hectares burned through early December. Drought in the south of Brazil caused significant damage to agriculture in the early part of the year with losses of about 11 per cent estimated for the soybean crop yield alone.Severe drought conditions also affected China. Millions of hectares of crops were damaged in Sichuan province during summer and in eastern China in autumn. Significant economic losses as well as severe shortages in drinking water were other consequences.As the 2005/2006 rainy season was ending, most countries in southern Africa were experiencing satisfactory rainfall during the first quarter of 2006. In northern Africa, floods were recorded in Morocco and Algeria during 2006 causing infrastructure damage and some casualties. Rare heavy rainfall in the Sahara Desert region of Tindouf produced severe flooding in February damaging 70 per cent of food stocks and displacing 60 000 people. In Bilma, Niger, the highest rainfall since 1923 affected nearly 50 000 people throughout August. In the same month, the most extensive precipitation in 50 years brought significant agricultural losses to the region of Zinder, Niger. Heavy rain also caused devastating floods in Ethiopia in August, claiming more than 600 lives. Some of the worst floods occurred in Dire Dawa and along the swollen Omo River. Again in October and November, the Great Horn of Africa countries experienced heavy rainfall associated with severe flooding. The worst hit areas were in Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia. Somalia is undergoing its worst flooding in recent history; some places have received more than six times their average monthly rainfall and hundreds of thousands of people have been affected. This year's floods are said to be the worst in 50 years in the Great Horn of Africa region. The heavy rains followed a period of long-lasting drought and the dry ground was unable to soak up large amounts of rainfall.Heavy rainfall in Bolivia and Equador in the first months of the year caused severe floods and landslides with tens of thousands of people affected. Torrential rainfall in Suriname during early May produced the country's worst disaster in recent times.After 500 mm of torrential rainfall during a five-day period in February, a large-scale landslide occurred in Leyte Island, the Philippines with more than 1 000 casualties. Although close to average in total rainfall, the Indian monsoon season brought many heavy rainfall events with the highest rainfall in 24-hours ever recorded in several locations.Only months after the destructive summer flooding in eastern Europe in 2005, heavy rainfall and snowmelt produced extensive flooding along the River Danube in April and the river reached its highest level in more than a century. Areas of Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania and Serbia were the hardest hit with hundreds of thousands of hectares inundated and tens of thousands of people affected.Persistent and heavy rainfall during 10-15 May brought historic flooding to New England (USA), described as the worst in 70 years in some areas. Across the US mid-Atlantic and north-east, exceptionally heavy rainfall occurred in June. Numerous daily and monthly records were set and the rainfall caused widespread flooding which forced the evacuation of some 200 000 people. Vancouver in Canada experienced its wettest month ever in November with 351 mm, nearly twice the average monthly accumulation.Conditions in the equatorial Pacific from December 2005 until the first quarter of 2006 showed some patterns typically associated with La NiÃ±a events. These however, did not lead to a basin-wide La NiÃ±a and, during April, even weak La NiÃ±a conditions dissipated. Over the second quarter of 2006, the majority of atmospheric and oceanic indicators reflected neutral conditions but, in August, conditions in the central and western equatorial Pacific started resembling typical early stages of an El NiÃ±o event (see WMO Press Release 765). By the end of the year, positive sea-surface temperature anomalies were established across the tropical Pacific basin. The El NiÃ±o event is expected by global consensus to continue at least into the first quarter of 2007.In the north-west Pacific, 22 tropical cyclones developed (average 27), 14 of which classified as typhoons. Typhoons Chanchu, Prapiroon, Kaemi, Saomai, Xangsane, Cimaron and tropical storm Bilis brought deaths, casualties and severe damage to the region. Landed tropical cyclones caused more than 1 000 fatalities and economic losses of US $ 10 billion in China, which made 2006 the severest year in a decade. Typhoon Durian affected some 1.5 million people in the Philippines in November/December 2006, claiming more than 500 lives with hundreds still missing. During the 2006 Atlantic hurricane season, nine named tropical storms developed (average: ten). Five of the named storms were hurricanes (average six) and two of those were \"major\" hurricanes (category three or higher on the Saffir-Simpson scale). In the eastern North Pacific 19 named storms developed, which is well above the average of 16; eleven reached hurricane strength of which six attained \"major\" status.Twelve tropical cyclones developed in the Australian Basin, two more than the long-term average. Tropical cyclone Larry was the most intense at landfall in Queensland since 1918, destroying 80-90 per cent of the Australian banana crop.On 25 September, the maximum area of the 2006 ozone hole over the Antarctic was recorded at 29.5 million kmÂ², slightly larger than the previous record area of 29.4 million kmÂ² reached in September 2000. These values are so similar that the ozone holes of these two years could be judged of equal size. The size and persistence of the 2006 ozone hole area with its ozone mass deficit of 40.8 megatonnes (also a record) can be explained by the continuing presence of near-peak levels of ozone-depleting substances in combination with a particularly cold stratospheric winter. Low temperatures in the first part of January prompted a 20 per cent loss in the ozone layer over the Arctic in 2006 (see WMO Press Release 760). Milder temperatures from late January precluded the large ozone loss seen in 2005.The year 2006 continues the pattern of sharply decreasing Arctic sea ice. The average sea-ice extent for the entire month of September was 5.9 million kmÂ², the second lowest on record missing the 2005 record by 340 000 kmÂ². Including 2006, the September rate of sea ice decline is now approximately -8.59% per decade, or 60 421 kmÂ² per year.This preliminary information for 2006 is based on observations up to the end of November from networks of land-based weather stations, ships and buoys. The data are collected and disseminated on a continuing basis by the National Meteorological and Hydrological Services of WMO Members. However, the declining state of some observational platforms in some parts of the world is of concern.It should be noted that, following established practice, WMO's global temperature analyses are based on two different datasets. One is the combined dataset maintained by the Hadley Centre of the UK Met Office, and the Climatic Research Unit, University of East Anglia, UK. The other is maintained by the US Department of Commerce's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Results from these two datasets are comparable: both indicate that 2006 is likely to be the sixth warmest year globally.More extensive updated information will be made available in the annual WMO Statement on the Status of the Global Climate in 2006, to be published in early March 2007.This is a joint Press Release issued in collaboration with the Hadley Centre of the Met Office, UK, the Climatic Research Unit, University of East Anglia, UK and in the USA: NOAA's National Climatic Data Centre, National Environmental Satellite and Data Information Service and NOAA's National Weather Service.

{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_664", "content": "Pratt and Battle were thrilled. They, along with Stephen Chan, Amber Reynolds, Daniel Robertson and Deanne Grant, spent a month conducting weather research in Senegal and Cape Verde, West Africa. The students worked with scientists from universities and government agencies to study how land storms become ocean storms and then make their way west to U.S. and Caribbean waters.\"African dust is very critical for hurricane formation. One of our flights allowed us to see the dust kicked up in the Sahara Desert,\" said Pratt, who is pursuing a doctorate in atmospheric science from Howard University in Washington, D.C. \"I had never done research overseas before and didn't know what to expect. Working with scientists in both Senegal and Cape Verde helped put our research in the proper perspective.\"Battle is also a doctoral candidate in atmospheric science at Howard University. \"When we flew over the Sahara Desert, it was serene and beautifully simple,\" she said. \"Africa's easterly waves and Saharan dust storms not only impact the weather in the United States and the Caribbean, but they also have implications for the inhabitants of many African countries. By sharing what we've learned, we increase the chances of helping those countries improve forecasting and predictability. That will have a positive impact on the agriculture and economy of the region.\"Howard University received a grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF) to support the American students' work with a large multinational team of scientists on a project called African Monsoon Multidisciplinary Analysis (AMMA). Scientists and students from around the world are involved with the project, which is also funded by nations in Africa, Europe and Asia.The students worked in the air and on the ground. The flights originated in Cape Verde and investigated easterly waves, developing tropical cyclones, Saharan dust outbreaks, convection and cloud microphysics. In Senegal, the students used advanced equipment to track precipitation, predict rainfall and measure air pressure.\"NSF's international office funds projects that give U.S. researchers and students the opportunity to conduct top-notch research while working with international collaborators,\" said Elizabeth (Libby) Lyons, regional program coordinator for Africa, the Near East and South Asia in NSF's Office of International Science and Engineering. \"These kinds of projects help develop a cadre of globally-engaged U.S. scientists and engineers who know how to work with international colleagues and who understand the context in which the research takes place and the impact of its results.\"Not only did the students contribute to science in a developing country, they also interacted with villagers in a high-profile field campaign. \"This project allowed them to get the first crack at the data and work with top-notch scientists from many nations\" said Gregory Jenkins, director of Howard University's Program in Atmospheric Sciences. \"The overall experience will make these students better scientists . Throughout their stay in West Africa, they were cognizant of Hurricane Katrina's impacts and how their work might help the United States.\"To adapt to their immersion in another culture, the students learned basic Wolof, Senegal's national language, and worked in Kawsara, a village approximately 30 miles southeast of the capital city Dakar. Throughout their stay, they learned to adapt to frequent outages of electricity.\"The logistics were the most challenging part of the project,\" said Stephen Chan, a graduate student at the University of Virginia. \"We took daily trips to the gas station to stock up on gasoline for the generator, and eventually we had to repair the generator because it broke down. But the Senegalese people were always creative and unwilling to quit until a solution was found.\" The AMMA project was Chan's first field research.Amber Reynolds, a graduate student at Texas A & M University, plans to return to West Africa in 2007 to work in Dakar. \"I'm trying to keep my Wolof skills up-to-date by talking with Senegalese students who attend Texas A&M,\" Reynolds said. \" I learned so much about culture and science. I'm excited to return and continue my research.\"The students will present a project overview and initial findings at the annual meeting of the American Meteorological Society in January 2007. In addition to pursuing research for their respective degrees, they also will develop publications in collaboration with their Senegalese colleagues. Challenged by sporadic electricity, the students wanted to learn about solar panels and wind power and may explore whether either alternative could provide basic electricity and water to the local communities they visited.\"It is extremely important for African-American and West African scientists to forge a link in science, just as we are already linked in history,\" Pratt said. \"I will cherish this experience, my first international research experience, and I'll work to make sure this is a beginning of great things, for myself, for Howard University, Senegal, and Cape Verde.\"The students' research was funded by NSF's Office of International Science and Engineering and the Division of Atmospheric Sciences."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_665", "content": "In the wake of Katrina, a category 5 hurricane that     devastated much of the nationâs Gulf Coast region in August     2005, three Rensselaer students traveled to New Orleans to     collect paperwork, e-mails, reviews, assessments, and other     documents that could provide them with information about how     each organization reacted to any given task during the     disaster. The recovered paper trail also provided the     researchers with insight into a variety of cultural and     organizational characteristics that impacted both agenciesâ     ability to act during the disaster.Throughout the groupâs research, a vast dichotomy between     the cultures of FEMA and the Coast Guard became increasingly     evident, according to William âAlâ Wallace, professor of     decision sciences and engineering systems (DSES) at Rensselaer,     and principal investigator on the project. The researchers     believe these cultural factors ultimately dictated how well     each organization was able to carry out its function and     responsibilities.Â âFEMAâs fatalist culture, coupled with the loss of its     cabinet-level position and budget and rulemaking authority,     crippled the agencyâs ability to fulfill its normal repertoire     of emergency coordination and response during Katrina,â says     Wallace. âOn the other hand, the Coast Guard had undergone     minimal organizational changes and had its pre-existing     routines supported, thus it was better equipped to fulfill its     duties during the disaster. Additionally, because of the Coast     Guardâs hierarchical culture, action orders continually     disseminated through the organizationâs chain of command to the     response team.âÂ Today Wallace is leading a team of researchers to construct     a computer simulation that models an extreme disaster situation     â similar to that of Hurricane Katrina â where decision-makers     are forced to shift their attention from one dimension to     another, responses often play out over long durations of time,     and information demands vary between interacting response     organizations.Theyâll then input a series of âwhat ifâ scenarios related     to organizational structure and culture into the disaster     model. Algorithms, or automated reasoning, will predict how     each organizationâs constraints would affect its ability to     effectively react to an emergency. The organizational factors     observed by the researchers while studying FEMA and the Coast     Guard will be used to test the model and to set the     parameters.âEssentially, the model will be able to determine how well     an organization will respond to a disaster based on the rules     it is following and its organizational structure,â says     Wallace, who warns that the device is not a scenario generator.     âIt wonât tell you âif you have a disaster and you donât get     enough ice to the victims in time, this will happen.â Instead     it will say âif you institute these rules and a disaster     happens, you will succeed or you will fail.ââWallace sees the model as a diagnostic tool that could help     local, state, and federal governments shed light on the     vulnerability of certain organizational features. It could also     aid in the development of more flexible, responsive approaches     to risk management, which is key to improving organizational     responses to extreme events, according to the researchers.âWhen a group of people are ingrained in an organization, it     can be difficult to identify the day-to-day operations or     procedures that could potentially become roadblocks when     responding to certain situations,â Wallace says. âThis model     will be a tool for organizations to study and reflect on the     ways their culture affects their ability to function.âTwo University of Washington researchers, Peter May and     Bryan Jones, serve as co-principal investigators on the     project, which also will consider how states assign risk     priorities, and how the federal government influences those     priorities. Other researchers include: Rachel Dowty and Colin     Beech, two doctoral candidates in the Department of Science and     Technology Studies (STS) at Rensselaer, and Yao Zheng, a senior     in mechanical and nuclear engineering at Rensselaer.Rensselaerâs portion of the collaborative research is funded     by a three-year $299,578 National Science Foundation (NSF)     Human and Social Dynamics (HSD) grant. An NSF Small Grant for     Exploratory Research (SGER) funded the Rensselaer teamâs     initial travel to New Orleans."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_666", "content": "\"When most people think about climate change, they think of heat stress from heat waves,\" said Cindy Parker, M.D., of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore. \"The heat wave in Western Europe in 2003 killed in excess of 30,000 people who wouldn't have died otherwise. With climate change, heat waves will become more severe, and last for longer periods of time.\" \"Scientists (in the U.S.) haven't done a good job of communicating why climate change is important to regular people,\" said Parker, who was invited to give a presentation on the health hazards of global warming at the Annual Meeting of the Geological Society of America in Philadelphia. Parker will speak in a Pardee Keynote Symposium on Sunday, 22 October.  \"The other thing that has gotten a lot of media attention is the increased risk of infectious diseases,\" said Parker. \"This is of greater concern to other parts of the world than the United States.\" That's because the U.S. has good public health systems that can track down infectious diseases, such as malaria, and intervene so they don't spread, she said. \"In my professional opinion, some of the less direct impacts will be much more devastating for us,\" said Parker. Hurricane Katrina was a primer on the matter. Global warming will bring bigger storms and hurricanes that will hold more water, according to climate scientists. Katrina showed how the water from a hurricane does far more damage than the high winds. All that flooding brings with it a host of direct and indirect health problems. \"As we saw from New Orleans, we're not good at evacuating people during storms.\" What's worse, she said, you can't evacuate critical infrastructure. \"Our biggest medical centers have been built in our larger cities.\"Thirteen of the 20 largest cities on earth are located at sea level on coasts, Parker points out. \"As sea level rises, there go our medical institutions, water treatment plants, emergency response units such as fire departments and ambulances. The bulk of the services designed to keep us healthy are almost all located in our larger cities, which are also located frequently at sea level.\"Then there is the matter of water. Clean water is one of the most basic and critical health needs. But climate change is threatening water supply quantities in many areas as well as water quality. \"Even without climate change, water is already in short supply,\" said Parker. \"But under changed climate conditions, precipitation patterns are expected to change.\" That means droughts and famines could become more prominent. Worsening water quality is expected to go hand-in-hand with the continuing deterioration of the natural ecosystems all around us. \"We rely on our ecosystems to provide very basic services to us,\" Parker explained. \"Despite our technology, we can't live without clean water, clean air, and soil to produce food. We rely on healthy ecosystems to provide these basic and absolute necessities.\" Forests, for example, absorb carbon dioxide from the environment, photosynthesize, and release oxygen as a waste product, which is essential for animal life. Similarly, with water, a healthy ecosystem such as a forest or wetland can filter a lot of toxins out of water and provide us with clean drinking water. Water supplies and water quality are already major health problems worldwide. In most years, drought and famine cause more than half of all deaths from natural disasters. Already 1.8 million people, mostly children, die each year from diarrheal diseases caused by contaminated water. Climate change will just make this worse, Parker says. Another absolute and basic need is, of course, food. That's also facing trouble, says Parker. Climate change will bring huge changes to how we grow food. Studies are mounting that show crops are likely to be more negatively affected by climate change than previously thought. \"We need to steel ourselves from changes and, quite likely, reductions in food supplies from around the world.\"All these changes, plus displacements of millions of people as was seen after Hurricane Katrina, pose health threats for everyone. But the most vulnerable members of our societies will be hardest hit, such as children, elders, city dwellers, and those who are socio-economically disadvantaged, says Parker. Planning for these threats and taking measures to minimize impacts is happening much too slowly, she said. \"These measures don't necessarily require a lot of money and we already have the new technology,\" she said. \"I'm a preventive medicine physician, and I use that training and way of thinking with respect to climate change as well. It makes a whole lot more sense to me to prevent our climate from more instability rather than waiting and putting our research and resources into trying to fix problems after they've happened.\""}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_667", "content": "Cynthia Rosenzweig and Vivien Gornitz are scientists on a team at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) and Columbia University, New York City, investigating future climate change impacts in the metropolitan area. Gornitz and other NASA scientists have been working with the New York City Department (DEP) of Environmental Protection since 2004, by using computer models to simulate future climates and sea level rise. Recently, computer modeling studies have provided a more detailed picture of sea level rise around New York by the 2050's.During most of the twentieth century, sea levels around the world have been steadily rising by 1.7 to 1.8 mm (~0.07 in) per year, increasing to nearly 3 mm (0.12 in) per year within just the last decade. Most of this rise in sea level comes from warming of the world's oceans and melting of mountain glaciers, which have receded dramatically in many places since the early twentieth century. The 2001 report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change found that a global warming of 1.4Â° to 5.8Â° C (2.5Â° -10.4Â° F) could lead to a sea level rise of 0.09-0.88 meters (4 inches to 2.9 feet) by 2100.A study conducted by Columbia University scientists for the U.S. Global Change Research Program in 2001 looked at several impacts of climate change on the New York metropolitan area, including sea level rise. The researchers projected a rise in sea level of 11.8 to 37.5 inches in New York City and 9.5 to 42.5 inches in the metropolitan region by the 2080s.\"With sea level at these higher levels, flooding by major storms would inundate many low-lying neighborhoods and shut down the entire metropolitan transportation system with much greater frequency,\" said Gornitz. With sea level rise, New York City faces an increased risk of hurricane storm surge. Storm surge is an above normal rise in sea level accompanying a hurricane. Hurricanes are categorized on the Saffir-Simpson scale, from 1 to 5, with 5 being the strongest and most destructive. The scale is used to give an estimate of the potential property damage and flooding expected along the coast from a hurricane landfall. Wind speed is the determining factor in the scale, as storm surge values are highly dependent on the slope of the continental shelf and the shape of the coastline, in the landfall region.A recent study by Rosenzweig and Gornitz in 2005 and 2006 using the GISS Atmosphere-Ocean Model global climate model for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change projects a sea level rise of 15 to 19 inches by the 2050s in New York City. Adding as little as 1.5 feet of sea level rise by the 2050s to the surge for a category 3 hurricane on a worst-case track would cause extensive flooding in many parts of the city. Areas potentially under water include the Rockaways, Coney Island, much of southern Brooklyn and Queens, portions of Long Island City, Astoria, Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, Queens, lower Manhattan, and eastern Staten Island from Great Kills Harbor north to the Verrazano Bridge. Gornitz will present these findings at the annual meeting of the Geological Society of America in Philadelphia during the week of Oct. 23.To understand what hurricane storm surges would do to the city, surge levels for hurricanes of categories 1 through 4 were calculated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for the 1995 Metro New York Hurricane Transportation Study using NOAA's SLOSH computer model. SLOSH (Sea, Lake and Overland Surges from Hurricanes) is a computerized model run by the National Hurricane Center to estimate storm surge heights resulting from historical, hypothetical, or predicted hurricanes by taking into account pressure; size, forward speed, track and hurricane winds. According to the 1995 study, a category three hurricane on a worst-case track could create a surge of up to 25 feet at JFK Airport, 21 feet at the Lincoln Tunnel entrance, 24 feet at the Battery, and 16 feet at La Guardia Airport. These figures do not include the effects of tides nor the additional heights of waves on top of the surge. Some studies suggest that hurricane strengths may intensify in most parts of the world as oceans become warmer. However, how much more frequently they will occur is still highly uncertain. Hurricanes have hit New York City in the past. The strongest hurricane was a category four storm at its peak in the Caribbean, which made landfall at Jamaica Bay on Sept. 3, 1821 with a 13-foot storm surge. It caused widespread flooding in lower Manhattan. The \"Long Island Express\"&#157; or \"Great Hurricane of 1938,\" a category three, tracked across central Long Island and ripped into southern New England on Sept. 21, 1938, killing nearly 700 people. The storm pushed a 25-35 foot high wall of water ahead of it, sweeping away protective barrier dunes and buildings. The 1995 Transportation study was done to assess the vulnerability of the city's transportation system to hurricane surges. The 2001 Columbia study was one of the regional studies for the U.S. National Assessment of Climate Variability and Change; the recent study for the NYC DEP was to evaluate potential climate change impacts, including sea level rise, on the agency's mandated activities and infrastructure.\"This entire work is solutions oriented,\" said Rosenzweig. \"It's about helping NYC DEP and other New York City agencies make better preparations for climate extremes of today, and changing extremes of the future. The report will help us determine how can we do better job now, as well as in the future.\""}

To test these hypotheses, Dr. John Valentine and Marine Technician Susan Sklenar, both of the Dauphin Island Sea Lab (DISL) in Alabama, are currently comparing the results of salinity tolerance experiments they have conducted using milfoil at the DISL with two years of field data which document salinity patterns within the upper reaches of Mobile Bay.  The preliminary results of these experiments suggest that only the most extreme salinities, those observed during hurricane landfalls in the northern Gulf of Mexico, are lethal to milfoil. \"Right after Hurricane Katrina, we noticed that milfoil was not as abundant in those places where it used to be plentiful,\" recounts Dr. Valentine.  \"Whether it was the turbidity from the storm or the salinity from waters crashing over the MBC, we're hoping these experiments will be able to help determine the cause.\" In the coming year, Dr. Valentine and his colleagues will be conducting additional field experiments to determine if in fact milfoil will outcompete native grasses for habitat within this estuary. It is hoped that these experiments, when completed, will allow DISL to make data-based recommendations for habitat restoration later next year."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_669", "content": "There are two primary types of sea surface temperature data that scientists use. The first is the actual temperature readings from the ocean water surface. The second is called a sea surface temperature anomaly that compares present temperatures to the long-term average.Visualizers at NASA's Scientific Visualization Studio at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Md. have created two products. The first is a daily update of actual sea surface temperatures. Whenever clouds in the satellite data block the sea surface, the product interpolates the data.  Interpolation is a calculation method for estimating data in regions that fall between points of actual measurement.The second product is a 10-day average of sea surface temperatures over specific areas. This 10-day average helps to show or calculate the temperature anomaly. \"Climate and weather are great dances between the oceans and the global atmosphere,\" says Bill Patzert, climatologist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif. \"Sea surface temperature changes control whether these dances are slow and graceful, as with climate, or stormy and violent, as with wild hurricanes and winter storms. Floods, droughts, hurricanes or balmy weather can often be foretold by shifting sea surface temperatures. Sea surface temperatures are a crystal ball that helps us see and plan for the future.\"The web page graphics are the result of data from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E) instrument that flies aboard NASA's Aqua satellite. Big climate events like El Nino and La Nina in the eastern Pacific Ocean are directly related to ocean temperatures and can be seen in the sea surface temperature anomaly product. If the Eastern Pacific ocean temperatures deviate from average, this product will show that. El Nino and La Nina are also connected to changes in air pressure systems. In a normal year, steady winds blow westward and push warm surface water toward the western Pacific Ocean. In contrast, during an El NiÃ±o year, weakened winds allow warm water to occupy the entire tropical Pacific, so scientists look at sea surface temperatures for a signal of El Nino's return. Usually sea surface temperature readings off South America's west coast range from 60 to 70 degrees Fahrenheit (15-21 degrees Celsius), while they exceed 80 degrees Fahrenheit (27 degrees Celsius) in the \"warm pool\" located in the central and western Pacific. Rainfall tends to follow the warm water eastward, causing drought in Indonesia and Australia and also altering the path of the jet stream - a region of strong winds high in the atmosphere - that helps control weather patterns and storm paths. La NiÃ±a is characterized by unusually cold ocean temperatures in the central Equatorial Pacific. Sea-surface temperatures along the equator can fall as much as 7 degrees Fahrenheit (4 degrees Celsius) below normal. During La NiÃ±a, the easterly trade winds strengthen and cold upwelling - the transport of colder, deeper waters to the ocean's surface - intensifies along the equator and the West coast of South America. Like her counterpart El Nino, La Nina also changes weather patterns around the world.La NiÃ±a tends to bring nearly opposite effects of El NiÃ±o to the United States -- wetter than normal conditions across the Pacific Northwest and drier and warmer than normal conditions across much of the southern tier. Both La NiÃ±a and El NiÃ±o tend to have the most profound influence in the winter.  During El NiÃ±o years, temperatures in the winter are typically warmer than normal in the North-Central States, and cooler than normal in the Southeast and the Southwest. During a La NiÃ±a year, winter temperatures are warmer than normal in the Southeast and cooler than normal in the Northwest.Hurricane forecasters rely on daily sea surface temperatures to determine the behavior of tropical cyclones, the general name for tropical depressions, tropical storms, typhoons and hurricanes. Sea surface temperatures must be at least 82 degrees Fahrenheit (28 degrees Celsius) for a tropical cyclone to develop and maintain itself. If there are no winds to tear a storm apart, warm ocean waters often allow a tropical cyclone to strengthen, since it is the primary \"fuel\" for development.Maps of sea surface temperatures and anomalies are highly valuable to ocean and atmospheric scientists. They are one the primary tools climatologists use to monitor and forecast El Nino and La Nina events, and to forecast the frequency and intensity of hurricanes in all oceans.For NASA's New Sea Surface Temperature Page, please visit on the Web:"}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_670", "content": "Now, scientists at Florida State University and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration have found that the surge in Apalachee Bay was amplified by a \"trapped wave\" that originated off the southwest Florida coast. The discovery of this previously undocumented storm surge phenomenon has changed how NOAA's National Hurricane Center prepares storm surge models for the Gulf of Mexico. New modeling procedures will help improve the accuracy of storm surge forecasts for the entire Gulf coast from Florida to Texas.Scientists Steven Morey, Mark Bourassa, Dmitry Dukhovskoy and James O'Brien of FSU's Center for Ocean Atmospheric Prediction Studies and Stephen Baig of NOAA's Tropical Prediction Center of the National Hurricane Center drew their conclusions after conducting numerical experiments with storm surge models. Their research was published in the Oct. 4 issue of the journal Geophysical Research Letters.Hurricane Dennis formed from a tropical depression that originated near the southern Windward Islands on July 4, 2005. It strengthened as it traveled northwest through the Caribbean Sea until it made landfall in Cuba as a Category 4 hurricane. It then traveled west of the Florida Shelf, and the storm's maximum sustained winds weakened to 54 mph before it made landfall on the western Florida Panhandle. \"Winds from Dennis forced water against the southwestern Florida coast creating a bulge of high sea level from Naples to around Tampa,\" Morey explained. \"Oceanographers know that this 'bulge' will form a long wave that, in the Northern Hemisphere, will travel as a wave with the coast to the right. Because Dennis traveled nearly parallel to the Florida Peninsula coast at the same speed as the wave, winds from Dennis amplified the wave as it traveled to Apalachee Bay.\"The trapped wave then piled up on the shore along Apalachee Bay on top of the surge generated by the winds over the bay, according to O'Brien.\"To address these findings, we will use as necessary a larger geographical grid in our operational storm surge model in the Gulf of Mexico,\" said Baig, oceanographer and storm surge leader at NOAA's National Hurricane Center. \"This will provide a more comprehensive view of a storm's potential impact in the Gulf by better accounting for the rare trapped wave effect.\"This type of remotely trapped wave could play a role in future storms that follow a path similar to Hurricane Dennis or travel westward south of the Louisiana coastline toward Texas, the scientists said.Funding from a NOAA Applied Research Center grant supported the research. Wind fields for the study were developed under funding by NASA and the National Science Foundation."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_671", "content": "Some have pointed to rising ocean temperatures, brought on by global warming. Others say the upswing is simply part of a natural cycle in which hurricanes get worse for a decade or two before dying down again.  Now, researchers at the University of Wisconsin-Madison have put forward an intriguing theory that introduces a whole new dimension to the debate.  Writing today (Oct. 10, 2006) in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, the scientists discuss a surprising link between hurricane frequency in the Atlantic and thick clouds of dust that periodically rise from the Sahara Desert and blow off Africa's western coast. Lead author Amato Evan, a researcher at UW-Madison's Cooperative Institute for Meteorological Satellite Studies (CIMSS), pored over 25 years of satellite data - dating from 1981 to 2006 - and noticed the correlation. During periods of intense hurricane activity, he found, dust was relatively scarce in the atmosphere. In years when stronger dust storms rose up, on the other hand, fewer hurricanes swept through the Atlantic.  \"These findings are important because they show that long-term changes in hurricanes may be related to many different factors,\" says co-author Jonathan Foley, director of UW-Madison's Center for Sustainability and the Global Environment. \"While a great deal of work has focused on the links between [hurricanes] and warming ocean temperatures, this research adds another piece to the puzzle.\" If scientists conclusively prove that dust storms help to squelch hurricanes, weather forecasters could one day begin to track atmospheric dust, factoring it into their predictions for the first time.  Researchers have increasingly turned their attention to the environmental impact of dust, after it became clear that in some years, many million tons of sand rise up from the Sahara Desert and float right across the Atlantic Ocean, sometimes in as few as five days. \"People didn't understand the potential impact of dust until satellites allowed us to see how incredibly expansive these dust storms can be,\" says Evan. \"Sometimes during the summer, sunsets in Puerto Rico are beautiful because of all the dust in the sky. Well, that dust comes all the way from Africa.\"  The Sahara sand rises when hot desert air collides with the cooler, dryer air of the Sahel region-just south of the Sahara-and forms wind. As particles swirl upwards, strong trade winds begin to blow them west into the northern Atlantic. Dust storms form primarily during summer and winter months, but in some years - for reasons that aren't understood - they barely form at all.  Evan decided to explore the correlations between dust and hurricane activity after CIMSS research scientist Christopher Velden and others suggested that dust storms moving over the tropical North Atlantic might be able to suppress the development of hurricanes.  The UW-Madison researchers say that makes sense because dry, dust-ridden layers of air probably helps to \"dampen\" brewing hurricanes, which need heat and moisture to fuel them. That effect, Velden adds, could also mean that dust storms have the potential to shift a hurricane's direction further to the west, which unfortunately means it would have a higher chance of hitting U.S. land.  While the UW-Madison work doesn't confirm that dust storms directly influence hurricanes, it does provide compelling evidence that the two phenomena are linked in some way. \"What we don't know is whether the dust affects the hurricanes directly, or whether both [dust and hurricanes] are responding to the same large scale atmospheric changes around the tropical Atlantic,\" says Foley. \"That's what future research needs to find out.\""}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_672", "content": "As part of its activities to better understand Earthâs dynamic climate, NASA research is helping to increase knowledge about the behavior of hurricane waves. The NASA Scanning Radar Altimeter (SRA), designed to take measurements of the changing wave height and structure in and around hurricanes, flew through many storms on a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) WP-3D aircraft from 1998-2005. It captured unprecedented details on wave behavior that are helping improve sea height forecasts. Strong storms like Hurricane Bonnie in August 1998 - the first to be monitored by SRA - were found to produce severe ocean waves and dramatic changes in wave height and complexity over small distances. The SRA measures waves by sweeping a radar beam across the ocean and measuring the distance to the sea at many points. Those distances are then subtracted from the aircraft altitude to produce a sea-surface elevation map that is displayed on a monitor in the aircraft.While the flight portion of the SRA hurricane research program concluded with the 2005 hurricane season, the data gathered continue to help researchers develop and improve ocean wave computer models that simulate hurricane-generated ocean wave height, dominant wavelength, and wave direction. These computer models allow wave behavior to be predicted at times and places where there are no observations. However, actual observations from SRA are essential because \"they tell us how the wave field - the height, length and direction of waves in a given area â actually varies with a hurricane's wind speed, size, and forward motion so that we can improve the performance of the models that disaster managers and structural engineers rely on for guidance,\" said C. Wayne Wright, NASA Wallops Flight Facility, Wallops Island, Va. Ongoing research efforts have shown that ocean wave height responds rapidly to changes in a storm's wind speed. But scientists believe the overall wave field is also driven by the size or radius of a storm's strongest winds, and its forward speed. In Hurricane Katrina in August 2005 the largest waves, up to 40 feet, were found near the strongest winds. In September 2004, scientists with the Naval Research Laboratory-Stennis Space Center, Bay St. Louis, Miss., measured a record-size ocean wave - a whopping 91 feet - when the eye wall of Hurricane Ivan passed over sensors in open water over the Gulf of Mexico.\"Ocean depth is another critical factor in wave height,\" said Edward Walsh, NASA Wallops Flight Facility, Wallops Island, Va. \"Our observations from Hurricane Bonnie indicated that as soon as the waves encountered the continental shelf - the underwater extension of the coastal plain - their length began to shorten and they became steeper. As the water became shallow, wave height plummeted.\" Similarly, with Hurricane Rita in September 2005, the wave height dropped dramatically and was only 9 feet when wave energy was lost due to the shoaling of water on the continental shelf - the process in which waves coming into shallow waters are slowed by friction and become closer together and steeper.Fortunately, a storm's most massive waves usually decrease in size when they interact with the ocean's continental shelf and other land forms, like \"barrier islands\" that form a thin protective wall between the open sea and the mainland. The islands absorb the strongest waves, sheltering the mainland during large storms. But with powerful storms like Katrina, the constant battering of waves can take a toll on the land, leaving the islands reduced or gone altogether. SRA's detailed and precise information, together with data to be gathered by a new operational SRA being built by NOAA to replace the NASA prototype, promises to provide additional insight into a hurricane's behavior. Such research is increasingly important as areas become more prone to higher storm surges as natural defenses like barrier islands and wetlands disappear."}

These three New Orleans homes were selected for the study based on their levels of flood water, whether they previously were structurally sound, and if they were located in an area likely to be rebuilt. The study examined the extent to which homes that experienced significant and prolonged exposure to flood waters could be satisfactorily cleaned to enable reconstruction. Homes were inspected for roof leakage, standing water and the extent of mold throughout their interiors, as well as heating ventilation and air conditioning. \"From our data, it is clear that levels of mold were so high that we strongly recommend that those entering, cleaning, and repairing flood-damaged homes wear respirators that are more protective than plain dust masks,\" said Ginger Chew, ScD, assistant professor of environmental health sciences at Columbia's Mailman School of Public Health.  \"While our assessments of the data are based on a small demonstration project, the results give a clear picture of what is acceptable in flood clean-up procedures.\" The project was sponsored by the NIEHS Center for Environmental Health in Northern Manhattan and Enterprise Community Partners, and was carried out by the  Mailman School of Public Health, the National Center for Healthy Housing (NCHH) and several other academic institutions including Tulane School of Public Health, the University of Cincinnati, Harvard School of Public Health, The University of Iowa, and Case Western Reserve University.  \"Our goal was to make recommendations for the safe removal of flood-damaged articles, safe re-entry into homes, and safe levels of worker protection,\" said Jonathan Wilson, deputy director of the National Center for Healthy Housing. According to researchers, these findings not only will inform those involved in current clean-up activities in New Orleans and other environments, but will benefit those responding to any future disasters that may occur.The findings will be published in the December issue of Environmental Health Perspectives."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_674", "content": "TRMM, a joint mission between NASA and JAXA, the Japanese Space Agency, was launched in 1997 to study rainfall in the tropics. Since then, researchers and forecasters have found TRMM invaluable. TRMM has provided rainfall data in places that have no rain gauges, as well as lightning data and a never before seen 3-D look into storms. That 3-D capability has also led scientists to formulate a theory on \"Hot Towers,\" or towering clouds that form in the eyewall of a hurricane. Currently, scientists are using TRMM data to provide a complete picture of precipitation around the entire world. Goddard scientists Bob Adler and George Huffman are compiling this information using TRMM, as well as data from NASAâs Aqua satellite, a few Department of Defense satellites, a few National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration polar-orbit satellites, and five international geostationary-orbit satellites. Polar orbiting satellites fly over the north and south poles. Geostationary satellites are those that orbit the Earth in a fixed position over the Equator. This combination of satellite data allows Adler and Huffman to compute how much rain has fallen over three hour periods for most of the world, not including the upper northern and lower southern hemispheres. Huffman said \"Data from TRMM are key to getting the complete picture of rainfall around the world, because of the satellite's high quality sensors and special orbit.\" Adler and Huffman take advantage of these attributes to adjust each of the other satellite data sets to TRMM's rainfall data. NASA uses these TRMM Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis data to create maps of rainfall accumulation along the tracks of hurricanes."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_675", "content": "Scientists are using airplanes, sensors, radar, computer modeling programs and NASA satellites to better understand hurricanes. Some of the NASA satellites include Aqua, the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM), and the recently-launched Cloudsat/CALIPSO satellite. Edward Zipser of the University of Utah, Salt City, is the chief mission scientist. Following is an on-location report from Dr. Zipser during the NAMMA Hurricane field mission.On August 23, 2006, scientists on the NAMMA mission took an eight hour flight into a tropical disturbance. Edward Zipser noted \"surprisingly strong winds at 700 millibars (approximately 10,000 feet high), considering how the system seemed to be struggling to survive in the midst of the Sahara Air Layer.\"The Saharan Air Layer (SAL) is a mass of very dry, dusty air which forms over the Sahara Desert during the late spring, summer, and early fall and usually moves out over the tropical Atlantic Ocean. The SAL usually extends between 5,000-20,000 feet in the atmosphere and is associated with large amounts of mineral dust, dry air and strong winds (~25-55 mph).Zipser said, \"We saw evidence of dry air, typically from 750-550 millibars (10,000 to 19,000 feet), on almost all quadrants, but of course we wonât know right away how much of this air actually entered the inner core of the storm.\"During the previous two flights into the tropical system, the scientists used a communications system called \"X-Chat\" system. The main advantage was that mission scientist, Jeff Halverson, who was on the ground, watched movie loops of the tropical system and he was able to pass information to the DC-8 aircraft, while the flight scientist could rapidly relay information back.The scientists on the DC-8 aircraft noted that the storm structure they were flying over featured was not symmetrical (not identical on both sides of a central line) below about 6-7 kilometers (around 4 miles) altitude. They also noted that the system's strongest winds were on the east and north side.Another benefit to flying into a storm was that the scientists were able to better determine its exact location. The storm was found to be north of the forecast position. Zipser and his crew dropped about 24 dropsondes into the storm. A dropsonde is a sensor that measures temperature, pressure, moisture and winds throughout different locations of a storm.When the scientists flew into the tropical cyclone, they noticed that there were two different air circulations happening, like layers of a cake. In the top layer, higher than the surface, (above 500-400 millibars or 20,000 feet), the center of the cyclone seemed to be well southeast of the cyclone that was on lower level (at the surface).When the scientists flew over the âeyeâ or center of the tropical cyclone at a height of 35,000 feet, they we were continuously in thick cirrus clouds (wispy clouds made of ice crystals). Later, however, they were able to look at data from the PR-2 (an airborne radar) showing a sloping eyewall to 7 kilometers (4.3 miles).Convection (rising air that condenses higher in the atmosphere to form clouds and storms) decreased during the flight with little or no significant turbulence and no large areas of organized rainfall from stratiform clouds (layered clouds).The dropsondes were not spaced closely enough to give a proper description of the wind circulation close to the center of the storm, so the plane carrying Zipser and his crew descended to 10,000 feet (700 millibars) where they mapped the winds on the north and east sides of the storm. Winds were about 40 to 50 nautical miles per hour (45-55 mph), and there were some winds in excess of 60 knots (70 mph). There were no strong winds on the south side of the storm. The scientists estimated the winds on the surface around 40-45 knots (45-51 mph).Every flight into a storm gives scientists more information about how tropical cyclones work. The NAMMA mission ends in mid-September, 2006."}

Witt, now CEO of James Lee Witt Associates, LLC, headed FEMA during the Administration of President Bill Clinton.\"As I look at the presentations in this symposium, that's perhaps the most striking message,\" Hathaway said in an interview. \"The dust has settled now and all the hoopla is over. We've actually had a chance to look at the real-world data from New Orleans. All indications at this point are that the hurricanes were not as devastating in stirring up chemicals as once feared.\"The data shows that there is no real need to ban fish consumption, for instance. Levels of some toxic metals are high in parts of New Orleans, but not generally higher than before Hurricane Katrina or in some other urban areas.Hathaway, of Hathaway Consulting in Cape Girardeau, Mo., is an organizer of the symposium, which includes 37 presentations on hurricanes, tornadoes and other disasters. Speakers range from chemists who analyzed levels of toxic metals in New Orleans to ecologists studying environmental consequences of Katrina's storm surge to academics reporting on damage and recovery of universities in the Gulf disaster zone.In one report, Michael T. Abel, Ph.D., of Texas Tech University in Lubbock, describes finding potentially hazardous levels of lead and arsenic in New Orleans soil samples collected after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. \"It should be noted that similar values found in this sampling effort were present in studies conducted before the hurricanes,\" Abel wrote in a summary of his presentation.Jianmin Wang, Ph.D., and colleagues from the University of Missouri at Rolla, report that they collected 238 soil and sediment samples one month after Hurricane Katrina and analyzed them for pesticides and heavy metals. The pesticide levels were \"generally not of great concern,\" they concluded.In another study, Gregory J. Smith, Ph.D., reported that Hurricane Katrina's storm surge (rise in water driven by wind) severely scoured marshlands and barrier islands east of New Orleans and the Mississippi River. About 118 square miles of land in southeastern Louisiana was initially transformed into water, added Smith, who directs the U.S. Geological Survey's National Wetlands Research Center in Lafayette, La. Such changes reduce the ability of coastal wetlands to shield coastal communities from further hurricanes, he explained.Smith believes science has a role to play in restoring the coast. \"In many ways science, engineering and technology have played a role in human development of the coast, and it is these same enterprises that offer the greatest opportunity for transforming our coasts from ones that are vulnerable, like those impacted in 2005, to ones that are resilient,\" he said."}

Because the model fulfills both functions, it is easier for research findings to be translated into improved operational models, leading to better forecasts.The model was adopted for use by NOAA's National Weather Service (NWS) as the primary model for its one-to-three-day U.S. forecasts and as a key part of the NWS's ensemble modeling system for short-range forecasts. The U.S. Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA) also has used WRF for several areas of operations around the world.\"The Weather Research and Forecasting model development project is the first time researchers and operational scientists have come together to collaborate on a weather modeling project of this magnitude,\" says Louis Uccellini, director of NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Prediction.By late 2007, the new model will shape forecasts that serve more than a third of the world's population. It is being adopted by the national weather agencies of Taiwan, South Korea, China, and India.\"WRF is becoming the world's most popular model for weather prediction because it serves forecasters as well as researchers,\" says NCAR director Tim Killeen.Tests over the last year at NOAA and AFWA have shown that the new model offers multiple benefits over its predecessor models. For example:    * Errors in nighttime temperature and humidity across the eastern United States are cut by more than 50%.    * The model depicts flight-level winds in the subtropics that are stronger and more realistic, thus leading to improved turbulence guidance for aircraft.    * The model outperformed its predecessor in more than 70% of the situations studied by AFWA.    * WRF incorporates data from satellites, radars, and a wide range of other tools with greater ease than earlier models.NCAR has been experimenting with an advanced research version of WRF, with very fine resolution and innovative techniques, to demonstrate where potential may exist for improving the accuracy of hurricane track, intensity, and rainfall forecasts. A special hurricane-oriented version of WRF, the HWRF, is now being developed by scientists from NOAA, the Naval Research Laboratory, the University of Rhode Island, and Florida State University to support NOAA hurricane forecasting. The high-resolution HWRF will track waves and other features of the ocean and atmosphere, including the heat and moisture exchanged between them. Its depiction of hurricane cores and the ocean below them will be enhanced by data from satellites, aircraft, and other observing tools.WRF also is skilled at depicting intense squall lines, supercell thunderstorms, and other types of severe weather. Although no model can pinpoint hours ahead of time where a thunderstorm will form, WRF outpaces many models in its ability to predict what types of storms could form and how they might evolve.Approximately 4,000 people in 77 countries are registered users of WRF. Many of these users suggest improvements, which are tested for operational usefulness at a testbed facility based at NCAR and supported by NOAA.\"WRF will continue to improve because of all the research and development pouring into it from our nation's leading academic and scientific institutions,\" said AFWA commander Patrick Condray."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_678", "content": "Previous studies to understand the causes of SST changes have focused on temperature changes averaged over very large ocean areas â such as the entire Atlantic or Pacific basins. The new research specifically targets SST changes in much smaller hurricane formation regions.Using 22 different computer models of the climate system, atmospheric scientists from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and ten other research centers have shown that the warming of the tropical Atlantic and Pacific oceans over the last century is directly linked to human activities.For the period 1906-2005, the researchers found an 84 percent chance that external forcing (such as human-caused increases in greenhouse gases, ozone and various aerosol particles) accounts for at least 67 percent of the observed rise in SSTs in the Atlantic and Pacific hurricane formation regions. In both regions, human-caused increases in greenhouse gases were found to be the main driver of the 20th century warming of SSTs.Weâve used virtually all the worldâs climate models to study the causes of SST changes in hurricane formation regions,â said Benjamin Santer of Livermoreâs Program for Climate Model Diagnosis and Intercomparison, lead author of a paper describing the research that appears online this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.Santer, in conjunction with Livermore colleagues Peter Gleckler, Krishna AchutaRao, Jim Boyle, Mike Fiorino, Steve Klein and Karl Taylor, collaborated with researchers from the National Center for Atmospheric Research, the University of California, Merced, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, the University of Hamburg in Germany, the Climatic Research Unit and Manchester University in the United Kingdom, the NASA/Goddard Institute for Space Studies and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrationâs National Climatic Data Center.âIn the real world, weâre performing an uncontrolled experiment by burning fossil fuels and releasing greenhouse gases,â Santer said. âWe donât have a convenient parallel Earth with no human influence on climate. This is why our study relied on computer models for estimates of how the climate of an âundisturbed Earthâ might have evolved. The bottom line is that natural processes alone simply cannot explain the observed SST increases in these hurricane breeding grounds. The best explanation for these changes has to include a large human influence.âHurricanes are complex phenomena and are influenced by a variety of physical factors such as SST, wind shear, moisture availability and atmospheric stability. The increasing SSTs in the Atlantic and Pacific hurricane formation regions isnât the sole cause of hurricane intensity, but is likely to be one of the most important influences on hurricane strength.âThe models that weâve used to understand the causes of SST increases in these hurricane formation regions predict that the oceans are going to get a lot warmer over the 21st century,â Santer said. âThat causes some concern. In a post-Katrina world, we need to do the best job we possibly can to understand the complex influences on hurricane intensity, and how our actions are changing those influences.âThe Livermore portion of the research is funded by the Department of Energyâs Office of Biological and Environmental Research."}

NSF Announces New Awards to Study the Impact of Katrina on People and Social Systems: Whereas the initial wave of rapid-response teams tended to focus on engineering problems--the most notable being the failure of the New Orleans' levee system--the second group of teams focused on the human side of the story, including how people and organizations responded to the disaster and which factors are shaping the reconstruction. Researchers Release Draft Final Report on New Orleans Levees: Following an 8-month study of the New Orleans levee system and its performance during Hurricane Katrina, a 30-person team of researchers led by Raymond Seed and Robert Bea of the University of California, Berkeley, released a near-complete draft of their findings on May 22, 2006, in a \"town hall\" meeting in that Gulf Coast city. Hurricane Katrina: Scientists Fly Into Eye of the Storm: The Rainband and Intensity Change Experiment (RAINEX) project became the first hurricane research project to fly planes nearly simultaneously inside and outside a hurricane's principal rainband, gathering information that will help scientists to better understand changes in a hurricane's intensity. Number of Category 4 and 5 Hurricanes Has Doubled Over the Past 35 Years: The number of Category 4 and 5 hurricanes worldwide has nearly doubled over the past 35 years, according to a study by researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology and the National Center for Atmospheric Research. The change occurred as global sea-surface temperatures have increased over the same period. Seeing Into the Eye of Hurricane Rita: An advanced research weather model run by the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo., followed Hurricane Rita to give scientists a taste of how well forecast models of the future may predict hurricane track, intensity, and important rain and wind features. Gulf Warm-Water Eddies Intensify Hurricane Changes: Scientists monitoring ocean heat and circulation in the Gulf of Mexico during Hurricanes Katrina and Rita have a new understanding of how these tropical storms can gain intensity so quickly: The Gulf of Mexico's \"Loop Current\" is likely intensifying hurricanes that pass over eddies of warm water that spin off the main current. Small, Unmanned Aircraft Search for Survivors in Katrina Wreckage: Providing benefits of speed, portability and access, a pair of unmanned aerial vehicles surveyed storm-damaged communities in Mississippi as part of the search for trapped survivors of Hurricane Katrina. Robotics Researchers Return to Examine Katrina Devastation With Small Unmanned Helicopters: Building upon an earlier search mission using helicopter unmanned aerial vehicles, engineering researchers from the University of South Florida returned on Nov. 28, 2005, to the Mississippi Gulf Coast with their small, radio-controlled aircraft.Large Centrifuge Helps Researchers Mimic Effects of Katrina on Levees: Researchers studying the effects of Hurricane Katrina on the levees of New Orleans used a 150 g-ton centrifuge to model one of New Orleans' levee sections and the hurricane forces that led to the levee's failure. The goal of the test was to learn how layers of peat and clay beneath the levees might have contributed to the failure."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_681", "content": "The first launch of a balloon with its instruments, called a driftsonde, took place at Zinder, Niger, on Aug. 28. Some seven more driftsondes will be released from Zinder through late September, coinciding with the peak period of hurricane formation over the tropical Atlantic.\"Data from the driftsondes should help characterize the conditions that either foster or suppress hurricane formation,\" said the National Science Foundation's (NSF) Cliff Jacobs, who oversees support for the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) in Boulder, Colo.Scientists and engineers at NCAR and the French space agency, CNES, developed the driftsondes. The research was funded by NSF, NCAR's primary sponsor, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.Each balloon will drift from Africa toward the Caribbean at heights of around 65,000-70,000 feet, where light easterly winds prevail. Twice a day, each balloon will release an instrument known as a dropsonde that falls by parachute, sensing the weather conditions during its 20-minute descent and sending data back to the balloon and then to the researchers by satellite.Scientists will control the process from an operations center in Paris. If a weather system develops, they can signal the balloon to release additional dropsondes as often as once per hour.The Niger site was selected to study weak weather systems, called easterly waves, that serve as seedlings of hurricanes. Dozens of these waves move across Africa into the Atlantic between about 10 and 20 degrees North. A small number develop into tropical storms and hurricanes, some of which reach the U.S. Atlantic and Gulf coasts.\"The driftsondes will provide unique data on the conditions that lead to Atlantic hurricanes,\" said NCAR scientist David Parsons, U.S. coordinator for the project. \"They float at a speed close to the movement of the easterly waves, so we can stay above those waves and monitor them from their earliest stages.\"To build the driftsonde system, scientists, engineers, and machinists had to overcome many hurdles. Each driftsonde had to be robust enough to endure days of extreme stratospheric cold (averaging minus-80 degrees Fahrenheit) as well as the intense sunlight of the high, thin atmosphere.For the balloon deployment to be affordable and practical, the system also required low-cost, lightweight, off-the-shelf instruments capable of operating reliably in low pressure and in temperature extremes with very low power.Because of their flexible and relatively inexpensive nature, scientists believe, driftsondes may soon become a popular way to monitor and study many types of weather across the world's oceans and other remote regions."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_682", "content": "The authors suggest that this low rate of suicide thoughts is due to optimistic beliefs about the success of future recovery efforts. The research, led by investigators from Harvard Medical School (HMS), was published in a special online edition of the Bulletin of the World Health Organization: \"The increase in mental illness among Katrina survivors is not surprising, but the low suicidality is a surprise,\" says Ronald Kessler, PhD, professor of health care policy at HMS and lead author of the study. \"Our concern, though, is that this lowering of suicidal tendencies appears to be strongly associated with expectations for recovery efforts that might not be realistic.\"This report is the first in a planned series based on the Hurricane Katrina Community Advisory Group, a statistically representative sample of hurricane survivors participating in ongoing tracking surveys to monitor the pace and mental health effects of hurricane recovery efforts. The National Institute of Mental Health and the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Health and Human Services for Planning and Evaluation fund the project.To estimate the influence of Hurricane Katrina on the mental health of survivors, the researchers compared results of the post-Katrina survey with a survey carried out several years earlier that used the same assessment of mental illness. The earlier survey was the 2001-03 National Comorbidity Survey Replication (NCS-R), taken every 10 years to assess the mental health of the country. The NCS-R, although carried out throughout the entire country, included 826 respondents in the area subsequently affected by hurricane Katrina. The NCS-R, which is managed by the same HMS research team overseeing the Katrina project, was administered face-to-face, and had a 70 percent response, or cooperation, rate.The post-Katrina survey included a completely separate sample of 1,043 individuals who agreed to participate in the ongoing project. Interviewers reached participants by random-digit dialing of phones working in the eligible counties and parishes prior to the hurricane (if survivors relocated, calls were forwarded to their new locations), and from telephone numbers provided by the American Red Cross from individuals requesting assistance.The post-Katrina survey was carried out between January 19 and March 31, 2006 and had a response rate of 41.9 percent. Although this is a relatively low response rate in comparison to typical one-shot surveys, it is considerably higher than the response rates obtained in more conventional consumer panel surveys. A weight was applied to the survey to adjust for observed differences between respondents and non-respondents, as non-respondents tended to have somewhat higher levels of trauma exposure and hurricane-related psychological distress. Other weights were added to account for the household participant selection and any discrepancies between the sample and the population based on data obtained from the US Bureau of the Census.In addition to identically worded questions asked of the pre- and post-Katrina respondents, the post-Katrina survey also assessed \"cognitions\" found in previous research to predict adjustment to disasters. Mental illness was assessed with a widely accepted screening scale that can distinguish between serious and less serious cases. To validate the estimates of mental illness, trained clinical interviewers carried out follow-up assessments of depression, post-traumatic stress, panic, anxiety and other mental disorders in a random sub-sample of survey respondents. Suicide thoughts, plans, and attempts were assessed with a standard battery of questions about these outcomes.Kessler and his team found that post-Katrina survey respondents were significantly more likely than respondents in the earlier survey to have either serious mental illness (11.3 percent versus 6.1 percent) or mild to moderate mental illness (19.9 percent versus 9.7 percent). They also found that the prevalence of suicidal thoughts given mental illness was significantly lower in the post-Katrina survey than the NCS-R.The team discovered a strong relationship between the comparatively low rate of suicide thoughts and the existence of positive cognitions among Katrina survivors, especially with cognitions regarding increased sense of meaning and purpose in life and increased realization of inner strengths. For mentally ill post-Katrina survey respondents who did not endorse these cognitions, the prevalence of suicide thoughts was comparable to the prevalence in the NCS-R.The researchers concluded that despite the doubling of mental illness after Hurricane Katrina, these positive cognitions appear to have prevented increased suicidal thoughts, plans, and attempts. However, they also concluded that because the positive cognitions were tied to expectations about a better future, the results might only be a temporary reprieve.Kessler notes that although previous studies have suggested a connection between positive cognitions and lowered suicidality, this is the first study that offers quantitative evidence of these psychological processes in a sample of disaster victims.Kessler and his team believe that their findings suggest a systematic investigation of positive cognitions might be useful in guiding public health mass media efforts in the aftermath of future disasters, given that previous research has shown that public health messages play an important role in psychological reactions to disasters.\"The immediate take-home message for disaster recovery and policy makers is that communications with survivors can sometimes build on the temporary reprieve from suicidal tendencies afforded by these protective cognitions. Efforts on the part of public officials to control expectations as practical recovery moves forward without destroying the positive cognitions related to these expectations could prove crucial in the process of continued psychological recovery,\" says Kessler."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_683", "content": "Several NASA satellites gave important details about Katrina's storm structure and strength throughout her life cycle, aiding forecasters and emergency managers. In the aftermath, data from satellites and instruments on NASA planes became useful in recovery efforts, damage assessments, and analysis of the storm's environmental impacts. Katrina left as many as 1,833 dead according to the National Hurricane Center, and over $80 billion in damage.Katrina began as only a feeble storm being tracked by satellites and forecasters. On Aug. 23, Katrina was nothing but a mass of organized clouds over the Bahamas. But later that day, she quickly intensified and headed toward the U.S. coastline. Late on Aug. 25, she made her first landfall just south of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., as a Category 1 hurricane.As Katrina moved into the Gulf of Mexico, atmospheric conditions were favorable for rapid development. Data from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E) instrument on NASA's Aqua satellite showed unusually warm ocean temperatures in her path -- prime fuel for a hurricane.By early in the morning of Aug. 28, Katrina's winds reached a remarkable 175 mph -- a category 5 storm -- with a central pressure of 902 millibars, the fourth lowest pressure ever recorded in the Atlantic. During this phase of rapid development, forecasters were aided by data from NASA's Multi-angle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR) instrument on the Terra satellite that supplied information on Katrina's cloud motion and height, improving the accuracy of forecasts and warnings.The loss of life and property damage was worsened by breaks in the levees that separate New Orleans, La., from surrounding Lake Pontchartrain and Lake Maurepas. At least 80 percent of New Orleans was under flood water on Aug. 31, largely as a result of levee failures from Lake Pontchartrain, leaving some parts of the city under 20 feet of water. Storm surge from Mobile Bay led to inundation of Mobile, Ala.; and large portions of Biloxi and Gulfport, Miss., were underwater and essentially swept away by a 25-30 foot storm surge. Within two city blocks of Biloxi, two floating casinos disappeared.The flooding in New Orleans persisted for weeks and was captured by several NASA satellite instruments, including the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on NASAâs Terra satellite.In wake of the storm, changes to the coastline were observed by NASAâs Experimental Advanced Airborne Research Lidar (EAARL) mapping system that was flown on research aircraft. This mapping system is able to \"see\" through vegetation, like trees and shrubs, and view the land underneath to help determine hazard areas and environmental loss. The EAARL data proved helpful to emergency managers in rebuilding efforts.In Louisiana, scientists estimate that 25 percent of the coastal wetlands, which help lessen storm surges and weaken powerful winds, have disappeared in the 20th century, making inland areas more vulnerable to storms.Although 2005 was an unusually active year, meteorologists predict hurricane seasons with above-average activity for at least the next decade. In the future, NASA satellites and instruments will continue to monitor hurricane breeding grounds and provide unprecedented detail on their size and strength so forecasters can be alerted and issue more accurate forecasts and warnings."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_684", "content": "James Elsner of Florida State University in Tallahassee examined the statistical connection between the average global near-surface air temperature and Atlantic sea surface temperature, comparing the two factors with hurricane intensities over the past 50 years. He found that average air temperatures during hurricane season between June and November are useful in predicting sea surface temperatures--a vital component in nourishing hurricane winds as they strengthen in warm waters--but not vice-versa. Elsner's paper is scheduled to be published 23 August in Geophysical Research Letters, a journal of the American Geophysical Union. Several recent studies have warned that human-induced climate warming has the potential to increase the number of tropical cyclones (hurricanes), and previous research and computer models suggest that hurricane intensity would increase with increasing global mean temperatures. Others, however, hypothesize that the relationship between sea surface temperatures and hurricanes can be attributed to natural causes, such as the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation, an ongoing series of long-term changes in the sea surface temperature of the North Atlantic Ocean.\"The large increases in powerful hurricanes over the past several decades, together with the results presented here, certainly suggest cause for concern,\" Elsner said. \"These results have serious implications for life and property throughout the Caribbean, Mexico, and portions of the United States.\"Using highly detailed data from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to monitor sea temperature anomalies over the past half-century, Elsner used a causality test to establish evidence in support of the climate change/hurricane intensity hypothesis. His analysis helps provide verification of a linkage between atmospheric warming caused largely by greenhouse gases and the recent upswing in frequency and intensity of Atlantic hurricanes, including Katrina and Rita, which devastated parts of Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas in 2005.\"I infer that future hurricane hazard mitigation efforts should reflect that hurricane damage will continue to increase, in part, due to greenhouse warming,\" Elsner said. \"This research is important to the field of hurricane science by moving the debate away from trend analyses of hurricane counts and toward a physical mechanism that can account for the various observations.\"The research was funded by the National Science Foundation and the Risk Prediction Initiative of the Bermuda Biological Station for Research."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_685", "content": "Under the subject of \"Disasters and Aging,\" this installment of the PP&AR also features articles discussing the impact of national crises and the lessons policymakers can learn from them.Two major weather events in the past several years have wreaked special havoc on older adults - the Chicago heat wave of 1995 and Hurricane Katrina in 2005. People of advanced age were disproportionately overlooked, abandoned, or forgotten. Nearly 75 percent of the victims in Chicago and New Orleans were over the ages of 60 or 65, respectively.The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change recently reported that there is a 90 to 99 percent probability that there will be higher maximum temperatures and more heat waves over nearly all land areas in the twenty-first century. The group also stated that the likely consequences of these events would be an increased incidence of death and serious illness in older age groups and the urban poor.Just as normal emergency response systems become overloaded in times of disaster, functional seniors are among the first groups to become challenged beyond their reserves. Author Thomas Glass of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Health therefore outlines several policy recommendations to combat this problem. His research offers such suggestions as using census data to identify locations of vulnerable people and utilizing social support networks to assist in evacuations."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_686", "content": "\"Not only is the City of New Orleans built on reclaimed wetlands that have subsided by up to 5 meters, over 25 percent of coastal wetlands disappeared in the 20th century,\" says John Day (Louisiana State University).  Day, one of the symposia's presenters, argues that serious wetland restoration plans must close or restrict the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet, a canal that contributed to the flooding of New Orleans and that disconnects the river from its delta plain.  Wetlands help stem storm surges and diffuse powerful winds.Complementing Day's argument, Paul Keddy (Southeastern Louisiana University) believes residents in the Gulf Coast states will have to decide if they want \"business as usual\" or a dramatic change in the way people accept the limitations and realities of dynamic coastal areas.  During his presentation, Keddy will lay out what he sees as the connections between hurricanes, human irrationality, and Gulf Coast ecosystems.  \"From the American dust bowl to the collapse of the Canadian cod fishery, people have chosen development trajectories that are catastrophic in the longer term,\" he says.  Gary Shaffer (Southeastern Louisiana University) will suggest some concrete wetlands restoration steps that he believes will need to go hand-in-hand with human-made flood control barriers.  \"Bald cypress - water tupelo swamps are particularly effective at dampening forward progress of both floodwaters and winds,\" he notes.   Shaffer believes that cypress and tupelo seedlings could achieve 10 meter heights within a single decade and serve as major storm damage reduction agents.Looking specifically at Louisiana's Lake Pontchartrain, Carlton Dufrechou's (Lake Pontchartrain Basin Foundation, a non-profit organization dedicated to restoring and preserving the Lake Pontchartrain Basin) presentation will include post-storm satellite imagery that suggests that Hurricane  Katrina may have destroyed over 60 square miles of  the lake's wetlands in a mere 24 hour period.  \"As more coastal areas disappear, residents in the region become more vulnerable to the effects of tropical storms and hurricanes,\" says Dufrechou.  On a brighter note, however, the lake's water quality appears to have recovered to pre-Katrina conditions, in spite of being the recipient of nearly nine billion gallons of highly contaminated water pumped out of New Orleans and into the lake.Other speakers of the session will include Stephen Faulkner (U.S. Geological Survey) who will focus on the hurricanes' impacts on coastal forests, Robb Diehl and Frank Moore (University of Southern Mississippi) addressing the impact of hurricanes on migratory birds, Heather Passmore (Louisiana State University) exploring the interaction of hurricanes and fires, and William Platt (Louisiana State University) who will speak about sea level rise and hurricanes. The session is being organized by Colin Jackson (University of Mississippi) along with Gary Shaffer and Paul Keddy (Southeastern Louisiana University).For more information about this session and other ESA Meeting activities, visit:"}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_687", "content": "The field campaign, called NASA African Monsoon Multidisciplinary Analyses 2006, runs from Aug. 15 to mid-September in the Cape Verde Islands, 350 miles off the coast of Senegal in West Africa. This campaign is a component of a much broader international project, called the African Monsoon Multidisciplinary Analyses, aimed at improving the knowledge and understanding of the West African Monsoon.Researchers will use satellite data, weather station information, computer models and aircraft to provide scientists with better insight into all the conditions that enhance the development of tropical cyclones, the general name given to tropical depressions, storms and hurricanes. This research will help hurricane forecasters better understand the behavior of these deadly storms.\"Scientists recognize the hurricane development process when they see it, but our skill in forecasting which weak system will intensify into a major cyclone is not great,\" said Edward Zipser, mission chief scientist, of the University of Utah, Salt Lake City. \"That is why NASA and its partners place a high priority on obtaining high-quality data for weak disturbances, as well as those already showing signs of intensification.\"For hurricanes to develop, specific environmental conditions must be present: warm ocean waters, high humidity and favorable atmospheric and upward spiraling wind patterns off the ocean surface. Atlantic hurricanes usually start as weak tropical disturbances off the coast of West Africa and intensify into rotating storms with weak winds, called tropical depressions. If the depression continues to intensify and reaches wind speeds of at least 39 mph, they are classified as tropical storms. Hurricanes have winds greater than 73 mph.To study these environmental conditions, researchers will use NASA's DC-8 research aircraft as a platform for advanced atmospheric research instruments. Remote and on-site sensing devices will allow scientists to target specific areas in developing storms. Sensors on-board the aircraft will measure cloud and particle sizes and shapes, wind speed and direction, rainfall rates, atmospheric temperature, pressure and relative humidity.The campaign will use extensive data from NASA's fleet of earth observing satellites, including the Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission, QuikSCAT, Aqua, and the recently-launched Cloudsat and CALIPSO. These advanced satellites will provide unprecedented views into the vertical structure of the tropical systems, while the field observations will help validate data from the new satellites.To better understand the physics of hurricanes, researchers are seeking answers to questions about hurricane development, air currents and the effects of dust on clouds.During the field campaign, scientists hope to get a better understanding of the role of the Saharan Air Layer and how its dry air, strong embedded winds and dust influences cyclone development. The layer is a mass of very dry, often dusty air that forms over the Sahara Desert during the late spring, summer, and early fall and usually moves out over the tropical Atlantic Ocean.As part of looking at the Saharan Air Layer, scientists want to better understand dust's effect on clouds. Some evidence indicates that dust makes it more difficult for rain to form. Cloud models need to account for any such effect, so measurements of cloud droplet concentrations and size in clean ocean air and dusty air from the Sahara need to be made.Researchers also will look at what happens to air currents as they move from land to ocean waters. Information on clouds and moisture, heat, air movement, and precipitation in an unstable atmosphere will be collected, analyzed and then simulated in computer models. Understanding hurricane formation requires measurements from very small to very large scales, from microscopic dust and raindrops to cloud formations and air currents spanning hundreds of miles."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_688", "content": "The 1970s-style vacant ranch house was taking a beating, but not from a hurricane. Instead, engineers were simulating the effects of hurricane-force winds and wind-driven rain with a custom-built wind machine called the âWall of Wind.â Two caged airboat propellers, each driven by earsplitting Chevrolet V8 502 motors, blasted the house with 120-mph gusts and sheets of water.It was just one of several experiments earlier this month on 10 vacant homes in rural Polk County. The goal: To learn more about why most of Floridaâs homes â those built before the stateâs hurricane building code went into effect â buckle under hurricane-force winds. And to test the various methods for fortifying weak points, from reinforcing garage doors to protecting windows with plywood or other coverings.âWhat weâre trying to do is evaluate how much we can reduce an older homeâs vulnerability by applying post-construction retrofits,â said Kurt Gurley, lead researcher on the state-funded project and an associate professor of civil engineering at the University of Florida.Although some counties have had their own building codes for decades, Florida adopted its first statewide building code in 1994, two years after Hurricane Andrew devastated South Florida. The state significantly upgraded that code in 2001, strengthening provisions aimed at preventing hurricane wind damage.Previous research by Gurley and his colleagues has shown that homes built under the most recent code stood up to the four 2004 hurricanes better than those built under the first code. The problem, Gurley said, is that the majority of existing homes were built before 1992. In regions developed early, such as Tampa and St. Petersburg, nearly all the homes in many neighborhoods precede the statewide code. Gurley said that raises two questions: How well do these homes resist hurricane winds, and which of many possible retrofits make the most sense for homeowners seeking to fortify them?âWe want to quantify how much you reduce your vulnerability to wind with the various retrofits so that people can weigh the options,â Gurley said. âSome homeowners will have limited budgets, so we hopefully weâll come up with a way for them to prioritize.âEngineers have extensively tested building components and retrofits, but the work is usually done in labs, Gurley said. That means that while the results may have merit, they donât necessarily match field conditions, where rusted nails, rotted wood and other conditions frequently complicate matters.âThatâs about the most important thing: Weâre working in real conditions, capturing data from real houses,â said Forrest Masters, an assistant professor of civil engineering and director of the Laboratory for Wind Engineering Research at the International Hurricane Research Center at Florida International University.The 10 Polk County homes, built in the 1970s and 1980s, are typical for modest homes of their era. Their walls are concrete block, with aluminum frame windows and wood truss frame roofs. The engineers had access to the homes because they had flooded extensively and were bought through a state-federal buyout program for vulnerable properties.Besides the wind tests, the researchers used a trailer-mounted air cannon to fire two-by-four boards at one homeâs windows covered with Lexan, a Plexiglas-like material that can be used for shutters. The test was meant to stimulate flying debris in storms, a common source of damage in heavily populated areas that occurs as homes come apart in storms.A radar gun clocked the two-by-four at 40 mph as it slammed into the Lexan. The Lexan withstood the blow, but it flexed inward several inches, causing the glass window it was protecting to shatter. More important than the loss of a window, the protective cover stayed in place, preventing wind and rain from entering the house, researchers said.To test the strength of roof-to-wall connections against major uplift wind forces on the roof, the engineers used a crane to yank up on the edge of one roof. Rather than snap at the metal connection between the rafters and concrete block, the force cracked off the concrete beam at the wall. In newer homes, that beam is connected to the wall with steel rods, but homeowners of older homes can anchor the beam with a metal strap, researchers said.UF, FIU, Florida A&M University, the University of Western Ontario and the nonprofit Tampa-based Institute of Business and Home Safety are collaborating on the project, funded with a $190,000 grant from the Florida Department of Community Affairs."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_689", "content": "The research, funded by NASA and the National Science Foundation (NSF), marks the beginning of a new era in space weather prediction. The results are presented today at the American Astronomical Society (AAS)'s Solar Physics Division meeting in Durham, N.H.\"This confirms that computer models can describe the physics of the solar corona,\" said Zoran Mikic of Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC), San Diego, Calif.The turbulent corona is threaded with magnetic fields generated beneath the visible solar surface. The evolution of these magnetic fields causes violent eruptions and solar storms originating in the corona.Like a rubber band that's been twisted too tightly, solar magnetic fields suddenly snap to a new shape while blasting billions of tons of plasma into space, at millions of miles per hour, in what scientists call a coronal mass ejection (CME). Or the magnetic field explodes as a solar flare with the force of up to a billion 1-megaton nuclear bombs.When directed at Earth, solar flares and CMEs can disrupt satellites, communications and power systems.\"Finding out that a hurricane is bearing down on you isn't much good if the warning only gives you an hour to prepare,\" said Paul Bellaire, program director in NSF's Division of Atmospheric Sciences, which funded the research. \"That's the situation we're in now with space weather. Being able to determine the structure of the solar wind at its source -- the sun -- will give us the lead time we need to make space weather predictions truly useful.\"By accurately simulating the behavior of the corona, scientists hope to predict when it will produce flares and CMEs, the same way the National Weather Service uses computer simulations of Earth's atmosphere to predict when it will produce thunderstorms or hurricanes.The computer model was based on spacecraft observations of magnetic activity on the sun's surface, which affects and shapes the corona above it. The SAIC team released simulated \"photographs\" of the March 29 eclipse 13 days and again 5 days before the eclipse.During a total solar eclipse, the moon blocks direct light coming from the sun, so the much fainter corona is visible, resembling a white, lacy veil surrounding the black disk of the moon. That is the only time the corona is visible from Earth without special instruments.Because the corona is always changing, each eclipse looks different. The simulated photographs closely resembled actual photos of the eclipse, \"providing reassurance that the model may be able to predict space weather events,\" said Mikic.Previous simulations were based on simplified models, so the calculations could be completed in a reasonable time by computers available then. The new simulation is the first to base its calculations on the physics of how energy is transferred in the corona.Even with today's powerful computers, the calculations required four days to complete on about 700 computer processors.The scientific team includes Mikic, Jon Linker, Pete Riley, Roberto Lionello, and Viacheslav Titov, all of SAIC."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_690", "content": "In a recent report in the journal Science, researchers from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) found abundant colonies of Trichodesmium. The multi-celled, filamentous organism is thought to play a significant role in the input of nitrogen to the upper layers of the tropical and subtropical ocean, nearly half of the Earthâs surface.Lead author Cabell Davis, a senior scientist in the WHOI Biology Department, and co-author Dennis McGillicuddy, an associate scientist in the WHOI Applied Ocean Physics and Engineering Department, suggest that nitrogen fixation rates for Trichodesmium may be 2.7 to 5 times higher than previously estimated from traditional sampling.Trichodesmium is one of many tiny photosynthetic organisms that use the sunâs energy, carbon dioxide and other nutrients to make organic material that constitutes the basis of the marine food web.  Production of biomass in surface waters is typically limited by nitrogen, but Trichodesmium is able to escape that constraint by virtue of its ability to utilize nitrogen gas, which is plentiful in the atmosphere and upper ocean.Trichodesmium abundance has been difficult to measure using traditional net sampling because the colonies are easily damaged or destroyed during collection. Sampling with bottles has provided estimates of abundance of the organism, but it is a snapshot view.The Video Plankton Recorder (VPR) is a noninvasive instrument, consisting of a digital video-microscope on a towed vehicle that samples at 30 frames per second and automatically sorts the Trichodesmium images from other organisms.âIf traditional sampling has underestimated colonies in other regions of the world, our estimates of global Trichodesmium abundance will increase dramatically,â Davis said. âThat increase could potentially account for a significant portion of the global nitrogen cycle, thus changing our perception of the importance of this organism to the productivity of the world ocean.âDavis and McGillicuddy towed the VPR across the North Atlantic between the Azores and the Slope Water south of Woods Hole in 2003, skirting category 3 hurricane Fabian. The vehicle was towed at six meters per second, about 12 nautical miles an hour, surveying continually and automatically between the surface and about 130 meters (400 feet) deep like a yo-yo. Nearly 7,000 vertical profiles were taken during the 5,517 kilometer (about 3,443 miles) transit across the North Atlantic.While the colonies of Trichodesmium are fragile and thought to be destroyed when mixed by strong winds, the team found no evidence that hurricane Fabian, with winds up to 200 kilometers an hour (about 125 miles per hour), had caused them any damage. The team sampled the upper layers of the ocean across the wake of the storm.The researchers also found a strong correlation between temperature, salinity and abundance of Trichodesmium colonies in the various eddies and the Gulf Stream the VPR crossed during its survey.Two forms of Trichodesmium, called puffs and tufts because of their shapes, were found in higher concentrations in warm salty water. Higher concentrations of the organism were also found in warm anticyclonic eddies than in cold cyclonic ones, but the reasons are unclear.Davis and McGillicuddy are doing similar survey aboard WHOIâs research vessel Knorr, which just passed through the Panama Canal.  The researchers will deploy the VPR and survey across the Caribbean Sea, a region known to have very high concentrations of Trichodesmium.  The ship will arrive back at Woods Hole on June 29.Davis says the new Caribbean VPR survey will provide much needed information about Trichodesmium population estimates in its tropical home, information that has been difficult to obtain due to the patchy nature of the species in ocean waters.The project was supported by the Richard B. Sellars Endowed Research Fund, the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation Endowed Fund for Innovative Research, the WHOI Ocean Life Institute, the National Science Foundation and NASA."}

Scientists are now trying to determine if the frequency of lightning is connected to the hurricane's strength.In July of that year, NASA lightning researchers joined hurricane specialists from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and 10 universities for a month-long Tropical Cloud Systems and Processes (TCSP) field experiment in Costa Rica. The purpose of the mission was to determine what weather, climate and other factors that helped create tropical storms and hurricanes. They also wanted to learn about what makes these storms strengthen. All of these organizations study lightning in hurricanes to get a better understanding of the strengthening or weakening (intensification) of the storms.Hurricane Emily was one of three named storms (the others were Hurricane Dennis and Tropical Storm Gert) observed during the TCSP field experiment. Scientists flew NASA's ER-2 high-altitude weather plane above Emily, where they recorded some of the most powerful lightning activity ever seen in a hurricaneâs eye-wall. Emily was one of the largest, most violent hurricanes ever to be documented by the ER-2 plane.During the flights, scientists detected both cloud-to-ground lightning strokes and cloud-to-cloud lightning in the thunderstorms surrounding Emily's eye. They also found that the \"electric fields,\" or areas of the atmosphere that contained electricity above Hurricane Emily, were some the strongest ever recorded. \"We observed steady fields in excess of 8 kilovolts (8,000 volts) per meter (3.2 feet),\" says Blakeslee. \"That is hugeâand comparable to the strongest fields we would expect to find over a large land-based thunderstorm.\"The field experiment concluded before the birth of hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005. However, scientists also observed significant lightning in the eye walls of hurricanes Katrina and Rita through long range ground-based lightning detection networks. That similarity has generated more interest in trying to understand the connection between lightning activity and hurricane development, intensification and behavior.Researchers at the National Space Science and Technology Center, a facility jointly managed and operated by NASA MSFC and Alabama research universities, are working with the NOAA to better understand the connection between lightning and hurricane intensity.The month of June is typically known among meteorologists for promoting lightning safety awareness, because June is the first month of summer and brings thunderstorms.

{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_692", "content": "\"The global warming influence provides a new background level that increases the risk of future enhancements in hurricane activity,\" Trenberth says. The research was supported by the National Science Foundation, NCAR's primary sponsor.The study contradicts recent claims that natural cycles are responsible for the upturn in Atlantic hurricane activity since 1995. It also adds support to the premise that hurricane seasons will become more active as global temperatures rise. Last year produced a record 28 tropical storms and hurricanes in the Atlantic. Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma all reached Category 5 strength.Trenberth and Shea's research focuses on an increase in ocean temperatures. During much of last year's hurricane season, sea-surface temperatures across the tropical Atlantic between 10 and 20 degrees north, which is where many Atlantic hurricanes originate, were a record 1.7 degrees F above the 1901-1970 average. While researchers agree that the warming waters fueled hurricane intensity, they have been uncertain whether Atlantic waters have heated up because of a natural, decades-long cycle, or because of global warming.By analyzing worldwide data on sea-surface temperatures (SSTs) since the early 20th century, Trenberth and Shea were able to calculate the causes of the increased temperatures in the tropical North Atlantic. Their calculations show that global warming explained about 0.8 degrees F of this rise. Aftereffects from the 2004-05 El Nino accounted for about 0.4 degrees F. The Atlantic multidecadal oscillation (AMO), a 60-to-80-year natural cycle in SSTs, explained less than 0.2 degrees F of the rise, according to Trenberth. The remainder is due to year-to-year variability in temperatures.Previous studies have attributed the warming and cooling patterns of North Atlantic ocean temperatures in the 20th centuryâand associated hurricane activityâto the AMO. But Trenberth, suspecting that global warming was also playing a role, looked beyond the Atlantic to temperature patterns throughout Earth's tropical and midlatitude waters. He subtracted the global trend from the irregular Atlantic temperaturesâin effect, separating global warming from the Atlantic natural cycle. The results show that the AMO is actually much weaker now than it was in the 1950s, when Atlantic hurricanes were also quite active. However, the AMO did contribute to the lull in hurricane activity from about 1970 to 1990 in the Atlantic.Global warming does not guarantee that each year will set records for hurricanes, according to Trenberth. He notes that last year's activity was related to very favorable upper-level winds as well as the extremely warm SSTs. Each year will bring ups and downs in tropical Atlantic SSTs due to natural variations, such as the presence or absence of El Nino, says Trenberth. However, he adds, the long-term ocean warming should raise the baseline of hurricane activity."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_693", "content": "Following is the text of the Executive Summary of the report. The full 30-page report may be seen at  The knowledge available among AGU members provides scientific expertise on nearly all of the physical environment of the dynamic Gulf Coast ecosystem complex. Intelligently rebuilding features such as fisheries, oil fields, seaports, farms, and wetlands after hurricanes Katrina and Rita will require \"a well-constructed collaborative effort to maximize the role of science in decisions made about the rebuilding,\" wrote Charles Groat, former director of the U.S. Geological Survey, in a news article published in Eos that stimulated an AGU meeting of experts. As a step toward developing a scientific basis for safer communities along the Florida-Alabama-Mississippi-Louisiana-Texas coastline, AGU convened an interdisciplinary 'Conference of Experts' on 11â12 January 2006 to discuss what we, as Earth and space scientists, know about the present and projected environment in New Orleans and the Gulf Coast areas affected by the hurricanes of 2005. Twenty scientists, all experts in the fields of science relevant to the Gulf Coast, met to consider ideas for a coordinated effort to integrate science into the decision-making processes necessary for the area's sustainable rebirth. Political, economic, and social issues were intentionally not discussed. Nevertheless, it was recognized that these issues are intertwined with science and are of paramount importance. This report contains a summary of the discussion and is intended to be helpful in providing scientific understanding useful in redevelopment of the affected area. The objectives of the meeting were to review and assess the scientific knowledge in the areas most relevant in hurricane protection, to identify gaps in knowledge that could be filled by focused research, and to propose mechanisms to link science to the most effective reconstruction of New Orleans and other coastal areas affected by the recent hurricanes. The meeting attendees considered seven topics addressing the current understanding, near-term needs, and longer-term directions for: hurricanes, storm surge and flooding, subsidence, climate change, hydrology, infrastructure, and disaster preparedness and response. The messages from the conference are as follows. While all hurricanes are detected before landfall and their trajectories known to some degree, predictions of cyclone intensity and structure still contain great uncertainty. Although there have been substantial increases in the accuracy of hurricane track prediction over the past decade, seasonal predictions have shown little skill, for example, predicting an increasing number of hurricanes when fewer actually occur. European ocean-atmosphere models, however, have demonstrated improved capability and may provide more reasonable approximations in the future. Rising sea surface temperatures, routinely observed through infrared and microwave emission satellite sensors, increase the tropical cyclone heat potential and contribute to tropical cyclone formation and their intensification. The conference participants proposed the use of improved seasonal forecasts such as those being applied in Europe. The basic physics of storm surge is well understood. Remarkably accurate numerical models have existed for approximately 25 years in the United States and abroad for geometrically simple coastal areas. Recent developments have allowed modeling of complex regions such as the Louisiana shoreline that include channels, levees, and buildings. Nevertheless, better wind data, enhanced shoreline topography, and improved techniques to assess the location and range of flooding are necessary in storm surge models for simulating the range of flooding probabilities. Such modeling scenarios can be used to predict the extent of damage such as levee overtopping, were such an extreme event to take place. In the longer term, advanced high-resolution data could provide even better approximations of inundation and expected damage from flooding, thus allowing cities and regional disaster mitigation agencies to prepare an appropriate response to an impending disaster. Natural processes as well as human impacts have contributed to subsidence, the sinking of land over time, along the Gulf Coast. Presently, there is considerable discussion and debate among the scientific community regarding mechanisms and rates of subsidence in the Mississippi delta area. Regional faulting, forced drainage, oil and gas extraction, and groundwater withdrawal all have led to lowering of the elevation of highways and levees below their originally designed levels. As a result of subsidence, new U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency Base Flood Elevations maps that will be available for the area in 2007 may not be accurate; yet those maps will form the basis for flood control and establish levels for rebuilding. In the future, levees and other flood control systems should be designed and built to account for the amount of sea level rise and predicted subsidence expected over the design life of the structure. In designing new structures, consideration should be given to likely changes over time in storm surge, subsidence, and sea level. New and improved instrumentation would allow researchers to make better predictions of geological and subsidence processes. There are strong theoretical reasons to expect that warming of the oceans already has led to more intense hurricanes and will continue to affect tropical storm characteristics. Increasing ocean temperatures also cause sea level to rise due to thermal expansion and thus enhance storm surge. It is well established that a sea surface temperature of at least 26Â°C (79Â°F) is required for hurricane formation. Recent analyses have found that the frequency of intense hurricanes and severe rainfall has increased in recent decades. Hurricane strength and numbers are projected to increase further with rising ocean temperatures. The hurricane climatology of the twenty- first century will be quite different from that of the twentieth century. Planning should take into account the strong probability of more frequent and more intense hurricanes. In the near future, prediction models will be able to provide notice of exceptionally strong hurricane seasons more in advance than is presently possible. As these advances continue, and as more is known about the fundamental physical basis of climate change, hurricane response plans can be continually improved. Human settlement in New Orleans and throughout the Gulf Coast has greatly modified the natural conditions of the Mississippi River system. In New Orleans, for example, canals have been dredged for navigation and drainage, levees that limit flooding have been raised, tidal wetlands have been eliminated, and dams and locks have been constructed. As development projects have continued and expanded, the mechanisms that had preserved the Mississippi delta in the face of subsidence and erosion have been largely stifled. While the rebuilding of coastal communities has to account for such conditions, long-term flood protection will likely require reestablishing some natural systems such as wetlands that serve as a natural barrier adding some protection from storm surge and flooding.  When floodwaters from hurricanes Katrina and Rita spilled through the Gulf Coast and breached the levee system in New Orleans, infrastructure damage ranged from unusable roads and bridges to inoperable telecommunications, electrical, and satellite observation systems. The breakdown of communications, both physical and organizational, will require extensive attention and modification. Additionally, ravaged systems such as navigation channels and coastal ports will require renovation and better protection against future damage. Improved models supported by a better understanding of the region's natural systems are needed to plan a unified system of storm protection. No matter how resilient the new Gulf Coast may be, preparation for future hurricanes will require development of the capability for massive and timely responses to protect resources and lives. Key to an effective response are detailed scenarios, maps, and visualizations of the affected areas. In addition, training of first responders is necessary so they can react to ever changing scientific data. Most critical is accurate information with three to four days notice that would provide time for evacuations, if necessary. Improved forecasts of hurricane trajectory, intensity, and structure are most vital to completing these tasks. The key objective of the conference of experts was to ensure the integration of science into the overall reconstruction efforts after the recent hurricane disasters along the Gulf Coast. Given the breadth of the Earth and space science topics within AGU's purview, the organization and member scientists are well prepared to discuss and demonstrate the relevance of sound science to decision-makers charged with rebuilding when future catastrophes strike. Several recommendations emerged from the conference that would continue the dialogue between scientists and planners at all levels. The suggestions are as follows: (1) Establish a multidisciplinary steering committee to maintain an overview on reconstruction and new threats to the region from natural disasters, and charge that committee with monitoring the rebuilding and identifying key scientific issues and assets to address these issues; (2) assemble a database of experts who would be available to provide scientific guidance as needed; and (3) provide periodic assessments of reconstruction and planning efforts. Successful and sustainable reconstruction of New Orleans and the Gulf Coast and the effective planning for future hurricane events must incorporate the best available science. This can only be ensured by strong continuing interaction among scientists, planners, and decision-makers at all levels."}

The most recent was the September 11 terrorist attack in New York City.Although the prevalence of PTSD has previously been found to be higher after human-made and technological disasters than after natural disasters, Galea notes that this difference is largely due to differences in sampling.\"Most studies conducted after human-made and technological disasters have focused on direct victims, while studies of natural disasters typically include samples of people in the overall community who probably had substantially lower exposure to the disaster,\" he said.In addition to exposure to a disaster, a number of other risk factors for PTSD were found to be important across multiple studies.Women consistently have a higher prevalence of PTSID after disasters than men, as do persons with pre-existing or concurrent psychiatric disorders and those who have previously experienced traumatic events or substantial stress.Galea, an M.D. who is an associate professor at the U-M School of Public Health and a research affiliate at the U-M Institute for Social Research, is involved in several other ongoing research projects related to the mental health consequences of disasters.One is a study of mental health service use among uniformed service providers in New York City in the first five years after the September 11 attacks. Another is a study of how social context, including income inequality, influences an individual's underlying strengths and vulnerabilities in the aftermath of a disaster."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_695", "content": "\"When you multiply this over 20, 30, or even 100 years, you can see that New Orleans will be lower, and this information should be factored into reconstruction plans, as we look at subsidence that is up to 3 feet in 40 years,\" said the lead author of the paper, Dr. Tim Dixon, Rosenstiel School geophysics professor. \"What we found is that some of the levee failure in New Orleans were places where subsidence was highest.  These levees were built over 40 years ago and in some cases, the ground had subsided a minimum of 3 feet which probably put them lower than their design level.\"  Through analysis of satellite radar imagery, and using structures in the city that strongly reflect the radar signal, the researchers were able to see where land is subsiding the most in New Orleans.   The team generated a map from space-based synthetic-aperture radar measurements, and note in their paper that it \"revealed that parts of New Orleans underwent rapid subsidence in the three years before Hurricane Katrina struck in August 2005.  One such area was next to the Mississippi River-Gulf Outlet (MRGO) canal: levees failed here during the peak storm surge and the new map indicates that this could be explained by subsidence of a meter or more since the levee's construction.\"  To make the map, the team used 33 scenes recorded from Canada's RADARSAT satellite.  The technique involves phase comparison of 33 radar images taken at different times along the same orbit and exploits points on the ground that strongly reflect radar, termed \"permanent scatterers.\"    \"While it may not trouble people that the ground is nearly one inch lower each year in places, in the long term, the impacts could be rather significant,\" said Dr. Falk Amelung, one of the paper's co-authors, also from the University of Miami Rosenstiel School.  \"While most people aren't accustomed to thinking about 100 years out, it's important to recognize that a large part of New Orleans is sitting on sediments that will only continue to sink into the Gulf of Mexico, and it will only get harder and harder to ensure the levees' durability.   By 2106, for example, the ground will be nearly three feet lower on average.\"  \"Global warming poses further challenges to this issue, as well,\" said Shimon Wdowinski another co-author from the University of Miami Rosenstiel School.  \"As the larger Mississippi Delta slowly slides into the Gulf of Mexico, the levees will be further tested if global warming increases the intensity and frequency of hurricanes.\"  The researchers conclude that their subsidence estimates for the levees \"are probably minimum estimates when considered over the lifetime of the levees, given that subsidence was most rapid in the first few years after their construction in the 1960s.  Levee failure may have resulted from overtopping because the levees were too low.  \"Data from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers collected after hurricanes Katrina and Rita confirm that water overtopped some levees that subsequently failed. Alternatively, the high subsidence rates the team observed might reflect active faulting or a weak, easily compacted soil, promoting failure at or near the levee base.\"Additional authors on the paper include: Alessandro Ferretti and Fabrizio Novali of Tele-Rilevamento Europa; Fabio Rocca of Dipartimento di Elettronica e Informazione, Politecnico di Milano; Roy Dokka of Louisiana State University; Giovanni Sella from the National Geodetic Survey; Sang-Wan Kim from the University of Miami Rosenstiel School; and Dean Whitman from the Florida International University Department of Earth Sciences.

{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_696", "content": "âAnthropogenic factors are likely responsible for long-term trends in tropical Atlantic warmth and tropical cyclone activity,â the researchers report in an upcoming issue of the American Geophysical Societyâs EOS.Michael E. Mann, associate professor of meteorology and geosciences, Penn State, and Kerry A. Emanuel, professor of atmospheric sciences, MIT, looked at the record of global sea surface temperatures, hurricane frequency, aerosol impacts and the so-called Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) â an ocean cycle similar, but weaker and less frequent than the El Nino/La Nina cycle. Although others have suggested that the AMO, a cycle of from 50 to 70 years, is the significant contributing factor to the increase in number and strength of hurricanes, their statistical analysis and modeling indicate that it is only the tropical Atlantic sea surface temperature that is responsible, tempered by the cooling effects of some lower atmospheric pollutants.âWe only have a good record of hurricanes and sea surface temperature for a little more than the last 100 years,â says Mann, who is also director of Penn Stateâs Earth System Science Center. âThis means we have only observed about one and a half to two cycles of the AMO. Peer-reviewed research does suggest that the signal exists, but it is difficult to estimate the period and magnitude of the oscillation directly from observations.âTo determine the contributions of sea surface warming, the AMO and any other factors to increased hurricane activity, the researchers used a statistical method that allows them to subtract the effect of variables they know have influence to see what is left.âThere appears to be a strong historical relationship between variations in tropical Atlantic sea surface temperature and tropical cyclone activity extending back through the 19th century,â say Mann and Emanuel.The cause of increased tropical Atlantic sea surface temperatures is the real question. One contributor must be overall global sea surface temperature trends. The researchers looked at the sea surface temperature record in the tropical Atlantic and compared it to global sea surface temperatures. They found that the tropical temperatures did closely follow the global temperatures, but that global fluctuation did not account for everything. They first found what appeared, at least superficially, to be a significant influence from the AMO in the tropical Atlantic.To test if the fluctuation was indeed due to the AMO, they looked only at data from before 1950. They found that the apparent AMO signal became indistinguishable from the statistical noise if the recent cooling trend between 1950 and the 1980s was not included.âThis pattern of late 20th century cooling has been attributed in past work to the anthropogenic production of tropospheric aerosol,â note Mann and Emanuel in their paper. This human-caused cooling, they found, was masquerading as part of an apparent natural oscillation.While some gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane in the upper atmosphere create the greenhouse effect associated with global warming, other pollutants, such as sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides in the lower atmosphere cool the Earthâs surface by reflecting sunlight.Because of prevailing winds and air currents, pollutants from North American and Europe move into the area above the tropical Atlantic. The impact is greatest during the late summer when the reflection of sunlight by these pollutants is greatest, exactly at the time of highest hurricane activity.When Mann and Emanuel use both global temperature trends and the enhanced regional cooling impact of the pollutants, they are able to explain the observed trends in both tropical Atlantic temperatures and hurricane numbers, without any need to invoke the role of a natural oscillation such as the AMO.Without taking into account the mitigating effect of pollutants, the results were higher than what had actually occurred. This suggests that the cooling from pollutants in the atmosphere tempered the rise of sea surface temperatures and hurricane numbers.However, the industrialized world is doing much better at controlling pollution. North America and Europe have both reduced the amounts of aerosols they put into the atmosphere. The cooling effect has been decreasing since the 1980s.Absent the mitigating cooling trend, tropical sea surface temperatures are rising. If the AMO, a regional effect, is not contributing significantly to the increase, than the increase must come from general global warming, which most researchers attribute to human actions."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_697", "content": "An average east Pacific hurricane season features 15 to 16 tropical storms, with nine becoming hurricanes, including four to five major hurricanes.âThe last three east Pacific hurricane seasons have been below normal, following an overall trend of lower activity since 1995,â said Jim Laver, director of NOAAâs Climate Prediction Center in Camp Springs, Md. Neutral El NiÃ±o/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) conditions are expected across the equatorial Pacific during the next three to six months. âTherefore neither El NiÃ±o nor La NiÃ±a will likely be a factor in this yearâs hurricane season,â added Laver.âAt present, the leading climate pattern affecting the east Pacific hurricane season is a multi-decadal signal, which contributes to stronger easterly winds at jet stream level and hence higher easterly wind shear,â said Muthuvel Chelliah, NOAAâs Climate Prediction Center lead scientist on the east Pacific hurricane season outlook. Wind shear refers to the change in winds between the lower and upper atmosphere. Higher wind shear inhibits hurricane formation. âSince 1995, despite the trend to warmer waters in the tropical east Pacific, higher wind shear has contributed to fewer tropical storms, hurricanes, and major hurricanes,â noted Chelliah.Most tropical storms and hurricanes that form in the east Pacific generally move towards the open expanse of the Pacific Ocean and do not make landfall. However during any given season a storm or two may affect western Mexico, Central America and the southwestern United States, as was the case with Hurricane Ignacio in 2003 and Hurricane Adrian in 2005.Despite the forecast for a below-average season, coastal residents are encouraged to be prepared and stay informed because it only takes one hurricane strike to create significant impacts.

{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_698", "content": "During a news conference at the NOAA National Hurricane Center, Deputy Secretary of Commerce David A. Sampson noted, \"Preparation is the key message that President Bush wants to convey during National Hurricane Preparedness Week. The impact from these storms extends well beyond coastal areas so it is vital that residents in hurricane prone areas get ready in advance of the hurricane season.\"\"For the 2006 north Atlantic hurricane season, NOAA is predicting 13 to 16 named storms, with eight to 10 becoming hurricanes, of which four to six could become 'major' hurricanes of Category 3 strength or higher,\" added retired Navy Vice Adm. Conrad C. Lautenbacher, Ph.D., undersecretary of commerce for oceans and atmosphere and NOAA administrator.On average, the north Atlantic hurricane season produces 11 named storms, with six becoming hurricanes, including two major hurricanes. In 2005, the Atlantic hurricane season contained a record 28 storms, including 15 hurricanes. Seven of these hurricanes were considered \"major,\" of which a record four hit the United States. \"Although NOAA is not forecasting a repeat of last year's season, the potential for hurricanes striking the U.S. is high,\" added Lautenbacher.Warmer ocean water combined with lower wind shear, weaker easterly trade winds, and a more favorable wind pattern in the mid-levels of the atmosphere are the factors that collectively will favor the development of storms in greater numbers and to greater intensity. Warm water is the energy source for storms while favorable wind patterns limit the wind shear that can tear apart a storm's building cloud structure.This confluence of conditions in the ocean and atmosphere is strongly related to a climate pattern known as the multi-decadal signal, which has been in place since 1995. Since then, nine of the last 11 hurricane seasons have been above normal, with only two below-normal seasons during the El NiÃÂ±o years of 1997 and 2002.With neutral El NiÃÂ±o/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) conditions expected across the equatorial Pacific during the next three to six months, the NOAA Climate Prediction Center scientists say that neither El NiÃÂ±o nor La NiÃÂ±a likely will be a factor in this year's hurricane season.\"Whether we face an active hurricane season, like this year, or a below-normal season, the crucial message for every person is the same: prepare, prepare, prepare,\" said Max Mayfield, director of the NOAA National Hurricane Center. \"One hurricane hitting where you live is enough to make it a bad season.\"The north Atlantic hurricane season runs from June 1 through November 30.

{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_699", "content": "The researchers, sociology doctoral student and lead author David Russell and professors John Taylor and Donald Lloyd, presented their findings at the 2006 annual meeting of the Southern Sociological Society held recently in New Orleans. Although the short-term mental health consequences of Hurricane Andrew have been documented, this study of adolescents is the first to show that it had long-term effects on mental health.  \"We found that people who experienced prior stressful events and who had pre-existing symptoms of psychological distress were more adversely affected by exposure to hurricane-related stressful events,\" Russell said.  \"Based on our findings, we believe intervention efforts should include assessments of the prior experiences and psychological well-being of disaster victims. Doing so will aid response workers in identifying those most at risk for developing post-disaster psychological problems.\"  The findings suggest that the mental health consequences of Hurricane Katrina, which struck the Gulf Coast on Aug. 29, 2005, will be even greater. Although the storms were similar in strength, the human and economic costs associated with Katrina far exceeded those of Andrew. Deaths associated with Katrina were more than 50 times greater than those attributed to Andrew, and economic analysts predict that the total economic cost of Katrina will surpass $200 billion, which is more than five times the cost of Andrew.  \"We believe that victims of Hurricane Katrina will be at an increased risk for mental health problems for many years to come,\" Russell said. \"The extent of damage was widespread and hundreds of thousands of people were displaced from their homes and families. Those aspects of the storm mean that many people were exposed to some degree of adversity, and that puts them at greater risk for mental health problems both immediately and over a long period of time.\"  Delays in rescuing people who were stranded by the flooding in New Orleans compounded the anguish of the Katrina survivors, the researchers noted.  \"The slow response by governmental agencies to rescue the victims produced feelings of hopelessness, isolation and anger,\" Russell said. \"In the meantime, exposure to human carnage has placed victims and recovery workers at great risk for a wide array of psychological problems.\"  Hurricane Andrew, a Category 5 storm on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale, hit South Florida on Aug. 24, 1992. The hurricane caused 25 deaths in Miami-Dade County alone. At the time, the damage inflicted by Andrew was unprecedented in U.S. history with total economic losses estimated at $35 billion. More than 250,000 people were left homeless, and the community's recovery from the storm took years.  The researchers studied data from 975 Miami-Dade County adolescents who lived through Hurricane Andrew to assess psychological distress before, during and five to seven years after the storm. They measured disruption by counting the occurrence of five events: damage to one's home; being away from home for longer than a week; injury to a family member; having one or both parents lose a job; and having to stay in a shelter.  Not only did Andrew cause emotional distress immediately following the hurricane, the researchers found that it indirectly affected mental health years later. The storm of emotion following the hurricane increased risk for certain stressful life events, such as failing a grade in school, being sent away from home or having to live away from parents.  Russell said the findings likely underestimated the true psychological impact of Hurricane Andrew because those most adversely affected by the hurricane may have relocated from the Miami-Dade area, and thus would have been left out of the follow-up surveys. In addition, the study measured some but not all of the common experiences associated with the disaster, such as perceptions of safety during the storm, loss of personal belongings and living without electricity and adequate food or water after the storm."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_700", "content": "In recent years, a large number of severe Atlantic hurricanes have fueled a debate as to whether global warming is responsible. Because high sea-surface temperatures fuel tropical cyclones, this linkage seems logical. In fact, within the past year, several hurricane researchers have correlated basin-wide warming trends with increasing hurricane severity and have implicated a greenhouse-warming cause.  But unlike these prior studies, the U.Va. climatologists specifically examined water temperatures along the path of each storm, providing a more precise picture of the tropical environment involved in each hurricane's development. They found that increasing water temperatures can account for only about half of the increase in strong hurricanes over the past 25 years; therefore the remaining storminess increase must be related to other factors.  \"It is too simplistic to only implicate sea surface temperatures in the dramatic increase in the number of major hurricanes,\" said lead author Patrick Michaels, U.Va. professor of environmental sciences and director of the Virginia Climatology Office.  For a storm to reach the status of a major hurricane, a very specific set of atmospheric conditions must be met within the region of the storm's development, and only one of these factors is sufficiently high sea-surface temperatures. The authors found that the ultimate strength of a hurricane is not directly linked to the underlying water temperatures. Instead, they found that a temperature threshold, 89?F, must be crossed before a weak tropical cyclone has the potential to become a monster hurricane. Once the threshold is crossed, water temperature is no longer an important factor. \"At that point, other factors take over, such as the vertical wind profile, and atmospheric temperature and moisture gradients,\" Michaels said.  While there has been extensive recent discussion about whether or not human-induced global warming is currently playing a role in the increased frequency and intensity of Atlantic hurricanes, Michaels downplays this impact, at least for the current climate.  \"The projected impacts of global warming on Atlantic hurricanes are minor compared with the major changes that we have observed over the past couple of years,\" Michaels said.  He points instead to naturally varying components of the tropical environment as being the primary reason for the recent enhanced activity.  \"Some aspects of the tropical environment have evolved much differently than they were expected to under the assumption that only increasing greenhouse gases were involved. This leads me to believe that natural oscillations have also been responsible for what we have seen,\" Michaels said.  But what if sea-surface temperatures continue to rise into the future, if the world continues to warm from an enhancing greenhouse effect?  \"In the future we may expect to see more major hurricanes,\" Michaels said, \"but we don't expect the ones that do form to be any stronger than the ones that we have seen in the past.\"Michaels' co-authors are Robert E. Davis, associate professor of environmental sciences and Paul C. Knappenberger, former U.Va. graduate student in environmental sciences.  Reference:"}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_701", "content": "Although La Nina occurs in the Pacific, it affects weather in the Atlantic Ocean as well, through changes in the winds. La NiÃ±a changes the wind patterns in the upper and lower levels of the atmosphere, which make it easier for hurricanes to form in the Atlantic and harder in the eastern Pacific. In the Atlantic, the winds that would normally tear a hurricane's circular motion apart are lessened but they increase in the eastern Pacific.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Climate Prediction Center is the federal agency that monitors La Nina conditions such as cooler than normal sea surface temperatures, precipitation and winds. According to their latest report on April 6, 2006, sea surface temperatures were warming back to normal. That latest report stated that during the month of April, sea surface temperatures were slightly cooler than normal in the extreme eastern equatorial Pacific, and conditions returned to near average in that region.David Adamec, an oceanographer at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Md. said that \"the current temperature signal at the end of April is near normal and the ocean surface temperature has not yet caused the atmosphere to respond in a La Nina-like way.\" Adamec used what is called a NASA coupled atmosphere-ocean land computer model. This model, developed at Goddard, is used for experimental forecasts of the ocean, land and atmosphere for periods 3-12 months in the future. The data used came from 2 NASA satellites: Jason and QuikSCAT. Jason provided sea-surface height information, and QuikSCAT provided surface wind data.Adamec said that in order for La Nina to have an effect on the Atlantic Ocean hurricane season, it would have to exist for a much longer time, especially into peak hurricane season which is August and September.Further, he said, another factor associated with La Nina is the Southern Oscillation Index, is also normal. The Southern Oscillation Index is an atmospheric pressure indicator of the large scale surface winds. \"La Nina is already a memory,\" said Adamec.According to 12 major ocean-atmosphere computer models, the equatorial Pacific will be neutral to warm in August, when it really matters for hurricanes. August and September are the peak season for hurricane formation in the Atlantic Ocean. According to scientists, the atmosphere takes about two weeks to \"react\" to a change in ocean surface temperature.Forecasters and other scientists still expect a greater than average number of Atlantic Ocean hurricanes this year, but La Nina will not be a factor in that. The more active season is expected because of other environmental conditions favorable to hurricanes, such as the location of the Bermuda high removing much of the wind shear in the western Atlantic that thwarts hurricanes, warm sea surface temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico.La NiÃ±a also influences where Atlantic hurricanes form. During La NiÃ±a more hurricanes form in the deep Tropics from African easterly waves. Easterly waves are \"long waves\" in the atmosphere that occur between 5-15 degrees North that start in Africa and move across the Atlantic Ocean. About 60% of the Atlantic tropical storms and minor hurricanes originate from easterly waves.According to NOAA, these systems have a much greater likelihood of becoming major hurricanes and of eventually threatening the U.S. and Caribbean Islands.Bill Patzert, oceanographer at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. noted that, \"The recent increased frequency of the hurricanes is thought to be part of a larger decades-long cycle of alternating increases and decreases of hurricane activity. The current busy hurricane cycle began in 1995 and could continue for another 10 to 25 years. For the U.S. East and Gulf coasts, the fading La Nina is a real good thing, but Atlantic sea surface temperatures are still very toasty. It's the summer conditions that will dictate the fall hurricane activity, and I suspect those forecasts will be modified.\""}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_702", "content": "To see how a hurricane works, scientists take readings of all its pieces: wind, rain, temperature, humidity and air pressure. They can also use computer models to try to re-create the storm's conditions. By comparing model simulations to actual observations of the storm, they can determine how good or bad the models are. If the models do poorly, scientists try to figure out what went wrong. If they do well, scientists can then use the model results to try to better understand how hurricanes form and intensify. Researchers did this after the summer of 2005, using Gert as a test case to make sure that their computer models were accurately \"re-assembling\" the storm as it appeared.Scott Braun, Atmospheric scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Md. and his co-author on the Gert study, Michael T. Montgomery, an Atmospheric scientist from Colorado State University, took data produced by the National Centers for Environmental Prediction about the state of the atmosphere during Gert, and used it in their computer model. The model produced a re-creation of Tropical Storm Gert. Their conclusions were presented at the American Meteorological Society's 27th Conference on Hurricanes and Tropical Meteorology the week of April 24, 2006, in Monterey, Calif.If one used only actual observations to figure out what makes a storm tick, it would be much more difficult because these observations are very limited in space and time. If scientists can trust that a computer model did a good job, they can use the model's information to figure out what is happening everywhere in the storm at all times. This will help scientists learn much more than they could from the observations alone.The Gert data was gathered by a large mission called the Tropical Cloud Systems and Processes Experiment, or TCSP, which included airplanes that dropped sensors called \"dropsondes\" into the storminess of Gert to get wind, temperature and humidity data. Other data used to check the accuracy of the computer model include flight-level winds from the NOAA P-3 aircraft, NASA ER-2 Doppler radar data, and precipitation information from a direct overpass of the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission satellite.Gert began as a low pressure area that formed in the Gulf of Honduras just east of Chetumal, Mexico on July 22. The low quickly moved inland over Yucatan, then into the Bay of Campeche early on the 23rd. A tropical depression formed on July 23 about 255 nautical miles east-southeast of Tuxpan, Mexico. The depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Gert on July 24th.\"We examined the role that topography in Mexico played in the development of Tropical Storm Gert,\" said Braun. They found that the mountains blocked the flow of air at low levels, which according to the computer model was critical in helping Gert form. As the weak disturbance that eventually became Gert moved into the Gulf of Mexico, the easterly winds associated with it ran up against the mountains of Mexico along the western side of the Gulf. When air flow like this encounters such an obstacle, it has two options.Under the right conditions, air flow could simply go up and over the mountains. However, under other conditions (when the air is stable), the air encounters more resistance to upward movement and must go around the mountains. That is what happened in Gert's case. As the easterly winds hit the mountains, they were forced to turn to the southeast in a direction parallel to the mountains. By turning the flow partially back in the direction from which it came, the mountains increased the large-scale rotation of the winds over the Gulf, thereby providing a more favorable environment for Gert to form and intensify.This may not necessarily apply to all storms in the Gulf. Gert was probably a borderline storm that needed help to form. While some systems like Gert may occasionally need help to develop, many other storms do not require such help, but can develop easily on their own. Scientists don't know how often storms might need this type of help. Even if it is not often, knowing how those kinds of storms develop is still important to those people who are impacted by them."}

The researchers in this study also used data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) GOES-11 satellite rapid-scan cloud track wind data. When the data were added, the resulting prediction showed improved track and intensity forecast of tropical storms.\"Our results indicate the quite positive impact of those data on forecasts of two landfall storms in last season: tropical storms Cindy and Gert.\" said Zhaoxia Pu, scientist at the University of Utah, Salt Lake City, and lead researcher on the study. She reported the results on April 24 at the American Meteorological Societyâs Conference on Hurricanes and Tropical Meteorology in Monterey, Calif. The detailed results of this study have been submitted to the Monthly Weather Review for publication.\"By incorporating the aircraft sensor and QuiKSCAT data, the new generation WRF computer model was able to reproduce structure of the rainfalls that caused the flooding during the landfall of two storms,\" Pu said.In July 2005, the Tropical Cloud Systems and Processes (TCSP) mission investigated two hurricanes and several tropical storms. The mission was based at the Juan Santamaria Airfield in San Jose, Costa Rica, and flew 13 NASA ER-2 science flights, including missions to Hurricanes Dennis and Emily. NASA, NOAA, and the Costa Rican Centro Nacional de Alta Tecnologia were participants in the mission.The P-3 aircraft from the NOAA Hurricane Research Division flew 20 coordinated missions with the NASA research aircraft to investigate developing tropical disturbances. Sensors dropped from airplanes, called dropsondes, gathered data on temperature, winds, pressure and humidity inside the storms.The team also employed small, unmanned aerial vehicles, a series of balloon-borne weather probes and several low-earth, polar-orbiting and geostationary NASA and NOAA satellites.The results from this study imply that satellite data are a valuable source for improving tropical cyclone forecasts. In addition, the 2005 field experiment provided valuable data and opportunities for better understanding tropical cyclones.The new generation WRF computer model is widely used for forecasting and research. It has been used by many local government agencies, research institutes and commercial industries for real-time forecasts.Pu said that NASA data's enhancement of WRF hurricane computer model forecasts will encourage the forecast community to incorporate it in all future hurricane forecasts."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_704", "content": "Using experience gained in DNA analysis of human remains after the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, Hopkins epidemiologists and genetic counselors are helping Louisiana state officials with the complex task of collecting data on family history, a key step in the complex system of DNA testing that state officials must use to match the dead to some of the families of more than 2,000 people still listed as missing from the disaster.    \"Both disasters, the attack on the World Trade Center and Hurricane Katrina, have challenged the nation's abilities to handle mass-fatality identification beyond anything ever experienced before,\" says Joan Bailey-Wilson, Ph.D., an adjunct professor at Hopkins and statistical geneticist.  Bailey-Wilson, also co-chief of the Inherited Disease Research Branch of the National Human Genome Research Institute, a member of the National Institutes of Health, has been coordinating national efforts of other geneticists who have volunteered from across the country to assist with victim identification in the Gulf region.  She sits on an expert panel, along with Hopkins' Elizabeth Pugh, Ph.D., M.P.H., a genetic epidemiologist, to advise crime lab staff and the coroners' offices in both states responsible for identifying the dead and missing.  It is a repeat role for the two, who also served on a panel for the medical examiner's office in New York City after the World Trade Center attacks five years ago.  Bailey-Wilson and Pugh have both visited the Gulf region since November 2005 to assist the Louisiana State Police Crime Laboratory with its efforts to manage the identification process and collection of buccal swabs (of the mouth cavity) from family members of the missing, almost all of whom are from Louisiana.    \"Pulling together the infrastructure - from experts in various disciplines and from medical centers across the country - is a skill that forensics experts learned from 9/11, but most of us hoped it was a once-in-a-lifetime event,\" says Bailey-Wilson.    According to the Hopkins experts, the DNA identification process following Katrina is a more complex job than initially thought.    That is because many of Katrina's missing victims lost their identifying personal effects in the disaster as well.  Items such as toothbrushes and hairbrushes, which could contain hair and saliva samples useful in DNA testing, were often contaminated or destroyed by the flooding.  Many medical and dental records normally used to match dead bodies with names of the missing were destroyed, leaving few clues behind as to whose remains were found.  All of these make identification difficult - without the aid of DNA testing.  Making matters worse, family members whose DNA is required to make a match were also displaced by the hurricane, making contact difficult and adding delays to scheduling interviews and appointments for genetic testing.    \"One of the lessons learned from 9/11 was that talking to the families about the missing is skilled detective work that can best be done by qualified genetics clinicians and genetic counselors who know the right questions to ask based on what information is needed to fill in the family pedigree,\" says Pugh, an assistant professor at The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and head of statistical genetics at the Center for Inherited Disease Research (CIDR), an NIH-funded initiative based at Hopkins.  CIDR is a high-tech facility dedicated to helping scientists at the NIH, Hopkins and elsewhere get a first fix on the regions of the human genetic code containing genes that contribute to complex diseases.   \"In today's world of blended families and multiple marriages, not all siblings are biologically related to one another.  And trained interview techniques are needed to separate the correct blood relationships involving DNA from the correct social relationships that do not involve any genetic material.\"    Bailey-Wilson, an adjunct professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, notes that since September 2005, she has fielded several hundred inquiries from health professionals wanting to help.  Of these, more than 70 geneticists from at least 30 medical institutions and private practices have agreed to serve as volunteers in efforts to collect information on family history.    Genetic counselor Julie Albertus, M.S., was the first Hopkins counselor to join the effort, having left for the Gulf region on March 12.  Nicole Johnson, Sc.M., C.G.C., and the Kennedy Krieger Institute's Rebecca Kern, M.G.C., were next and departed on March 19.  They, like Albertus, worked for one week at the Louisiana Family Assistance Center, formerly called the Find Family National Call Center, in Baton Rouge, La., where investigative operations are based.  Plans are under way to send another counselor in June.  While there, counselors interview relatives by phone to help construct complex family trees of those presumed lost, a necessary first step in the identification of the dead using DNA testing.    In DNA-marker testing, a person's unique genetic makeup is matched against other previously known samples or, if none exist, samples taken from family members, looking for unique genetic traits or markers specific to the individual or family.  The results from the DNA analysis can be used alone or combined with other information, such as body location and distinguishing features, for the state coroner to make an official identification.    Compiling a genetic picture of the family, however, requires an accurate construction of the family tree, so that the minimum amount of genetic information needed can be obtained from siblings or parents, or from cousins and grandparents.  \"If a missing aunt, for example, has no children and only one sibling, taking a family history can be simple.  However, if a missing aunt has eight children and five siblings, taking down the correct information and determining which relatives are willing to donate DNA samples can be a sensitive and time-consuming task,\" says Bailey-Wilson, who recalls that family interviews can last anywhere from 15 minutes to two hours.  Indeed, she notes, the process is made even more difficult by the fact that many of the relatives are themselves displaced from their homes and may have had to move several times since the hurricane.  Tracking this process for each missing person and casualty involves tremendous attention to detail, adds Pugh, who helped the Louisiana State Police Crime Laboratory's DNA unit set up one of the computer systems and protocols that will guide the identification process.  She points out that the whole identification effort follows strict confidentially rules to protect people's privacy.    A person's DNA contains all the genetic information passed down from their parents, but slightly different - though mostly similar - combinations are passed along to siblings.  Recognizable but distinct patterns can be seen in cousins, but with greater difficulty, and often requiring specialized tests.  Statistical methods are used to compare and match DNA samples to determine how likely it is that genetic markers for an unidentified deceased person fit into the pattern of genetic markers observed in relatives of someone reported missing.  According to Pugh, genetic testing is made easier by commercially available computer software programs to analyze DNA results.  These programs can statistically match any individual with genetic material from the same person or with that of family members using as few as 16 unique genetic markers.    \"One of our major tasks is to contact the families of those still reported missing and to obtain the DNA samples that will give us the best chance to identify their loved one,\" says Bailey-Wilson.  \"The work of volunteers and staff at the Louisiana Family Assistance Center and the State Police Crime Lab is helping these families, but it is also bridging the gap between genetic and forensic medicine to help make our country better prepared to deal with a massive disaster of this nature,\" says Bailey-Wilson, who like Pugh, has ties to the Gulf regions, where both studied and worked for several years.    But Johnson takes a much more simple view of her potential and willingness to offer assistance.  When asked to describe her motivation for volunteering, she says, \"Just knowing of the grief these families are going through is what motivates me. This is something I can do in my own small way to help out.\""}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_705", "content": "\"A key question in the global climate debate is if the climate warms in the future, will the water cycle intensify and what will be the nature of that intensification,\" said USGS scientist Thomas Huntington, who authored the study.  \"This is important because intensification of the water cycle could change water availability and increase the frequency of tropical storms, floods, and droughts, and increased water vapor in the atmosphere could amplify climate warming.\"  For the report, Huntington reviewed data presented in more than 100 scientific studies. Although data are not complete, and sometimes contradictory, the weight of evidence from past studies shows on a global scale that precipitation, runoff, atmospheric water vapor, soil moisture, evapotranspiration, growing season length, and wintertime mountain glacier mass are all increasing.  The key point with the glaciers is that there is more snowfall resulting in more wintertime mass accumulation -- another indication of intensification.  \"This intensification has been proposed and would logically seem to result in more flooding and more intense tropical storm seasons.  But over the observational period, those effects are just not borne out by the data in a consistent way,\" said Huntington.  Huntington notes that the long term and global scale of this study could accommodate significant variability, for example, the last two Atlantic hurricane seasons.   \"We are talking about two possible overall responses to global climate warming:  first an intensification of the water cycle being manifested by more moisture in the air, more precipitation, more runoff, more evapotranspiration, which we do see in this study; and second, the potential effects of the intensification that would include more flooding and more tropical storms which we don't see in this study,\" said Huntington.  Editors:  Copies of the report \"Evidence for intensification of the global water cycle:  Review and synthesis,\" are available to reporters from the author.

{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_706", "content": "Last summer, the journals Nature and Science published studies claiming to show a very strong link between rising tropical sea surface temperatures and an increase in the strength of hurricanes. The Nature study, by Kerry Emanuel at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, concluded that cyclonic storms in the North Atlantic and North Pacific oceanic basins were increasing in strength and duration. That increase, Emanuel concluded, was due to increasing sea surface temperatures caused, in part, by global warming.  A month later, the journal Science published research linking an increase in sea surface temperatures over the past 35 years to a near doubling in the number of the strongest hurricanes, those labeled Category 4 or 5. The study, authored by Peter Webster, Judith Curry and Hai-Ru Chang at Georgia Tech and Greg Holland at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, examined hurricanes in all oceanic basins that play host to cyclonic storms around the world.  This latest study sought to determine whether factors other than sea surface temperatures could be significantly contributing to this 35-year trend. Georgia Tech researchers Carlos Hoyos and Paula Agudelo, along with Curry and Webster examined three factors: vertical wind shear (changes in wind speed and direction with height); humidity in the lower atmosphere; and zonal stretching deformation, which is the tendency of the winds to rotate in a cyclonic direction.  \"If you examine the intensification of a single storm, or even the statistics on intensification for a particular season, factors like wind shear can play an important role,\" said Curry, professor and chair of the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at Georgia Tech. \"However, there is no global trend in wind shear or the other factors over the 35-year period.\"  Curry said they did see a small but significant trend in increasing wind shear strength in the North Atlantic, but that the sea surface temperatures were the dominant influence on the increase in both global hurricane intensity as well as the intensity of the North Atlantic hurricanes.  \"With this new paper, we firm up the link between the increase in sea surface temperatures and hurricane intensity, which has been a key issue in the debate about whether global warming is causing an increase in hurricane intensity,\" said Curry.The study appears online in the March 16 edition of Science Express.The study was supported by the Climate Dynamics Division of the National Science Foundation."}

It caused widespread destruction in Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama and turned out to be the most expensive hurricane in the history of the United States, causing an estimated 80 billion dollars in damages, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Katrina also turned out to be the deadliest U.S. hurricane since 1928, claiming at least 1,300 lives.The coastlines of those states were forever changed. NASA, using an Atlantic Global Research contract aircraft and the agencyâs own advanced technology, made it possible to see how much and what type of damage that Katrina caused when it came ashore.The changes to the coasts were cataloged in detail using NASA's laser mapping system called EAARL (Experimental Advanced Airborne Research Lidar) onboard an airplane. EAARL uses a laser to \"see\" and measure distance to a surface. EAARL can be used to get closer looks at things like coral reefs, sandy beaches, coastal vegetation, and trees.During the month of September, 2005, 250,000 pictures were taken over 5 days of flying over the coastlines.The EAARL Principal Investigator, Charles W. Wright, of NASAâs Wallops Island Flight Facility, Wallops, Va., placed the imagery online at Google Earth. \"This is the first time that I can remember such an easy-to-use tool putting so much data at the fingertips of so many people with so little effort,â Wright said.Wright said that the people involved with the project were busy working to bring the lidar data of the New Orleans levees online for FEMA, and had not anticipated that they would be bringing the photography online.The U.S. Geological Surveyâs Coastal and Marine Geology Program investigates the how much coastlines change due to hurricanes and other powerful storms. A big benefit to using this is that it will help people make decisions on where to rebuild.To see NASA imagery on Google Earth, first download Google Earth to your computer from the Web: For more information about EAARL, please visit on the Web:"}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_708", "content": "Recently, scientists used data from NASAâs Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite to analyze transformations that take place inside a hurricane. Stephen Guimond, a graduate research assistant at Florida State University, Tallahassee, Fla., lead a study that used TRMM data to view the height at which ice melts near the core of several tropical cyclones (the generic name for hurricanes or tropical storms), including Hurricane Ophelia in 2005.âThe temperature structure of a tropical cyclone is directly related to a stormâs wind speed and rainfall, which indirectly affects the storm surge,â Guimond said. It is important to monitor a stormâs thermal structure because this information assists meteorologists in estimating the impact on threatened areas of high winds, flash flooding and large storm surge.Many tropical cyclones transform into what are called âextra-tropical stormsâ as they move northward out of the tropics and into the mid-latitudes. During this stage, the stormâs cloud structure and high winds spread out over a wide area. As a result, the potential for heavy rainfall and large storm surge increases far from the center, potentially affecting life and property of more areas in the hurricane's path.When Guimond and his colleagues at the Naval Research Laboratory in Monterey, Calif. looked at the data from TRMMâs Precipitation Radar instrument, they could see the temperature changes inside a tropical cyclone. One piece of information that gave researchers a clue that a storm was becoming extra-tropical was that ice particles, which are found high up in the cold regions of thick clouds surrounding the eye of the storm, melted at lower levels. Usually, when a tropical cyclone is still in the âtropical stages,â ice particles melt higher in the clouds.By analyzing when and where ice particles are melting in tropical cyclones, researchers can better understand the various stages of an extra-tropical storm. This knowledge will help scientists re-create storms on computer forecast models, which can assist in the forecasting of future tropical cyclone transformations.There is another benefit to using the data from NASAâs TRMM radar. Guimond said that the thermal or heat data inferred from the satellite reveals information on storm intensity and also gives clues about how a storm formed. This will help hurricane forecasters and researchers gain a better sense of how the tropical cyclone will develop in the future.These findings were presented at the American Meteorological Society's 86th Annual Meeting in Atlanta."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_709", "content": "âWater quality management efforts aimed at protecting and preserving water quality and fisheries resources and habitat must be highly adaptive, taking both human nutrient enrichment and changes in freshwater input into consideration,â said Dr. Hans Paerl, Kenan professor of marine and environmental sciences at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hillâs Institute of Marine Sciences.âEstuaries are among the most productive and resource-rich waters on earth,â Paerl said. âThe recent hurricanes we have experienced have taught us that the growth and composition of phytoplankton are controlled and affected by both the freshwater inputs and nutrients contained in floodwaters accompanying hurricanes and other large storms.âPhytoplankton are key indicators of an estuaryâs ecological condition and health, he said. They are microscopic algae that form the base of the food chain, sustaining fisheries and overall fertility of large estuaries and other bodies of water, he said.âThis appears to be the major water quality management challenge over the next several decades, since climatologists have predicted that estuarine and coastal systems will face at least another several decades of elevated hurricane activity in the Atlantic,â the scientist said.The new study, scheduled to appear in late January in the journal Limnology and Oceanography, involved analyzing changes in water quality in the two largest estuarine systems in the United States before and after recent hurricanes such as Dennis, Floyd and Isabel.Besides Paerl, authors of the report are postdoctoral researcher Lexia M. Valdes and graduate student Benjamin L. Peierls of the UNC College of Arts and Sciencesâ marine sciences institute and Drs. Jason E. Adolph, research scientist at the Maryland Center for Biotechnology, and Lawrence W. Harding Jr., professor at the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science in Cambridge, Md.âBoth the Neuse River Estuary/Pamlico Sound and Chesapeake Bay systems have experienced large post-World War II increases in nitrogen and phosphorus loading from agriculture, industry and other sources, which often negatively affect water quality and marine life,â Paerl said. âWeâve taken steps to reduce nutrients to alleviate such harmful symptoms as algal blooms and oxygen depletion, but this is a highly complex situation affected by draughts, hurricanes, floods, farming, development and other human activities.âIn their study, the researchers uncovered similarities between the two largest U.S. estuaries, but also differences, he said.In water systems, variability in the length of time the water remained in approximately the same place strongly affected seasonal and longer-term patterns of the amount and kinds of phytoplankton present, Paerl said. During and following hurricane years, when more freshwater drained into the estuaries, conditions favored fast-growing diatoms in the Chesapeake Bay but not in the Neuse River and Pamlico Sound. That probably was because the bay is more open to the sea than the N.C. sound is.In the latter, spring growths of green algae (chlorophytes) and summer growth of blue-green algae (cyanobacteria) became more common, the scientist said. Such storm-driven changes have important ramifications for the animal plankton, or zooplankton, feeding on algae and, ultimately, on fish and shellfish that rely on specific types of phytoplankton and zooplankton. How an estuaryâs food web responds and its effects on fisheries are strongly dependent on the composition and abundance of phytoplankton sustaining the food web.âWhat happens to phytoplankton dynamics ultimately cascades up the food web,â Paerl said.He and colleagues currently are investigating the longer-term ramifications of storm-induced changes for fisheries.âSeasonally, droughts, floods and storm-related deep-water mixing overwhelmed attempts to control nutrients flowing off the land and into the sound and the bay,â Paerl said. âThis underscores the difficulty in predicting seasonal and longer-term phytoplankton production, composition and water quality responses to just nutrient management alone. The interactive effects of large, episodic freshwater discharges accompanying increased hurricane activity need to be incorporated in water quality management, at least for the foreseeable future.âAlong with UNC and Duke University colleagues, Paerl began monitoring surface water quality in the Neuse River and Pamlico Sound in 2000 with the help of state-run ferries. This program, FerryMon, has helped track and document long-term, ecosystem-scale efforts of large storms and droughts on the ecological condition and overall health of the estuarine system, which is the mid-Atlantic regionâs largest fisheries nursery. That ongoing data collection and associated research has become a model for continuous ferry-based water assays throughout the nation.Help and support from the N.C. Department of Transportationâs Division of Ferries and Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) deserves much of the credit, he said.Since then, marine scientists in Florida, Massachusetts, Maine and New York and as far away as San Francisco Bay and Washingtonâs Puget Sound have begun designing, and in some cases already using, comparable systems."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_710", "content": "Warmer-than-average 2005 for U.S. NOAA scientists report that the 2005 annual average temperature for the contiguous United States (based on preliminary data) will likely be 1.0 degrees F (0.6 degrees C) above the 1895-2004 mean, which will make 2005 one of the 20 warmest years on record for the country. Mean temperatures through the end of November were warmer than average in all but three states. No state was cooler than average. A July heat wave pushed temperatures soaring beyond 100 degrees, and broke more than 200 daily records established in six western states. A new record of seven consecutive days at â or above â 125 degrees F was established at Death Valley, Calif. The heat wave spread across the country during late July, scorching the East and prompted record electricity usage in New England and New York.The 2004-2005 winter was a season of contrasts for the West, with excessive rainfall in the Southwest and severe drought in the Northwest. A parade of winter Pacific storms triggered severe flooding and devastating landslides in southern California and brought the second-wettest winter on record to the Southwest region. Record and near-record snowpack levels, which were widespread across the Southwest by early spring, eased drought in a region where it had persisted for five years. Meanwhile, drought conditions worsened in the Pacific Northwest and northern Rockies in early 2005 and snowpack in much of the region was at record low levels at the end of winter. However, above average precipitation in subsequent months led to improving drought conditions in much of the region.During spring, the drought focus shifted to the Midwest and southern Plains. Severe dryness persisted across parts of northern Illinois, with Chicago and Rockford recording their driest March-November on record. Drought disasters were declared in all or parts of Arkansas, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Texas and Wisconsin. Drier-than-average conditions contributed to an active wildfire season that burned more than 8.5 million acres in 2005 â 4.5 million acres consumed in Alaska alone, based on preliminary data from the National Interagency Fire Center. This exceeds the old record set in 2000 for acreage burned in a wildfire season for the United States as a whole. At the end of November, 18 percent of the contiguous United States was in moderate-to-extreme drought based on a widely used measure of drought (the Palmer Drought Index) in contrast to six percent at the end of November last year.Record precipitation fell in the Northeast during the fall with three storm systems affecting the region in October. Nine states in the Northeast had their wettest October since 1895, and the October snowfall record on Mount Washington was shattered when 78.9 inches of snow fell during the month. Another notable snow storm in 2005 was the âBlizzard of 2005,â which brought more than two feet of snow across much of southern New England in late January. This storm ranked as the seventh most extreme snow event in the Northeast as measured by a newly developed Northeast Snowfall Impact Scale (NESIS) index and contributed to the snowiest January on record in Boston.The 2005 Atlantic hurricane season set several records. There were 26 named storms (storms with sustained winds of at least 39 miles per hour). In addition, there were an unprecedented 14 hurricanes, of which seven were major hurricanes (Category 3 or better on the Saffir-Simpson Scale). Three category 5 storms (sustained winds of 156 miles per hour or more) formed in the Atlantic Basin for the first time in a single season (Katrina, Rita and Wilma). Four major hurricanes and three tropical storms made landfall in the U.S., with an eighth storm (Ophelia) brushing the North Carolina coast. Tropical cyclone activity was near to below average in the Eastern Pacific and Western North Pacific basins through early December.The global annual temperature for combined land and ocean surfaces is expected to be very close to the record global temperature that was established in 1998 under the influence of an extremely strong El NiÃ±o episode. There has been no such El NiÃ±o event in 2005, but rather, unusual warmth across large parts of the globe throughout the year. NOAA is in the process of transitioning to an improved global temperature analysis system. The data analysis system used by NOAA for global temperature analyses over the past eight years indicates that 2005 would likely be the second-warmest year on record (1.06 degrees F; 0.59 degrees C above the 1880-2004 mean), marginally lower than 1998.The largest temperature anomalies were widespread throughout high latitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere and included much of Russia, Scandinavia, Canada and Alaska. During the past century, global surface temperatures have increased at a rate near 1.1 degrees F/Century (0.6 degrees C/Century), but the rate of temperature increase has been three times larger since 1976, with some of the largest temperature increases occurring in the high latitudes.Reflecting the global warmth in 2005, a new record was established in September for the lowest Arctic sea ice extent since satellite monitoring began in the late 1970s, according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center. This is part of a continuing trend in end-of-summer Arctic sea ice extent reductions of approximately eight percent per decade since 1979.The year began with the continuation of a weak El NiÃ±o episode that developed in late 2004, but sea surface temperatures in the central and east-central equatorial Pacific decreased early in the year and the episode ended by late February. Few impacts from the weak El NiÃ±o occurred worldwide, and neutral conditions persisted for the remainder of the year.Significant weather and climate events for the globe included: severe drought in parts of southern Africa and the Greater Horn of Africa, extreme monsoon-related rainfall in western India including a 24-hour rainfall total of 37.1 inches in Mumbai, the worst drought in decades in the Amazon River basin, severe drought in large parts of western Europe, and a record warm year in Australia.NOAA, an agency of the U.S. Department of Commerce, is dedicated to enhancing economic security and national safety through the prediction and research of weather and climate-related events and providing environmental stewardship of the nation's coastal and marine resources.Through the emerging Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS), NOAA is working with its federal partners and nearly 60 countries to develop a global monitoring network that is as integrated as the planet it observes."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_711", "content": "High concentrations of lead in the city's soil have previously been reported by others, but lead generally remains embedded in the soil and does not easily come in contact with people unless disturbed, says study leader Steven M. Presley, Ph.D., an environmental toxicologist at Texas Tech in Lubbock. He says that severe flooding may have loosened large amounts of embedded lead and caused it to be deposited on soil surfaces, where exposure to lead particles is more likely, either through skin contact or the inhalation of aerosolized particles. Lead exposure is a particular health concern among children because it can impair the nervous system and cause developmental problems.   Although lead is the biggest health concern, the scientists also found concentrations of aldrin (an insecticide), arsenic, and seven semivolatile organic compounds that exceeded EPA Region VI safe levels and are on EPA's list of known or suspected human carcinogens. In all, the researchers analyzed the sediment and soil samples for 26 metals and more than 90 semi-volatile compounds.  In addition to sediment and soil samples, the researchers also tested water and animal tissues following the flood. Other contaminants found among samples include high levels of iron, several banned pesticides and pathogenic bacteria, but the researchers say that concentrations of most of these contaminants were unlikely to pose an immediate human health threat. The peer-reviewed study, which represents one of the most detailed environmental sampling efforts to date following the flooding caused by Katrina, will appear in the Jan. 15 issue of \"The purpose of this study is to gather more extensive samples and establish baseline data upon which to evaluate the long-term environmental impact of the storm,\" says Presley. \"It may take years before we really know the full extent of the human health risks and wildlife impact from the Katrina contaminants, but this is an important step.\"  The researcher cautions that this study alone won't answer the much debated question of whether it is safe to return to the area. Nonetheless, says Presley, people should be made aware of the contaminants that are present and take appropriate cleanup measures to minimize the potential health risks.   For the current study, the research team obtained sediment, soil, water and animal tissue samples over a three-day period (Sept. 16-18) from across a broad cross-section of the city 18 days after the hurricane struck and after most of the water had been pumped from the city. The sampling included 14 different sites in the New Orleans area and focused mainly on the sediment and soil.   Floodwater samples taken at some sites showed extremely high levels of bacteria, particularly Aeromonas hydrophila, a little known human pathogen that can cause diarrhea and wound infections. This is the first time that Aeromonas has been detected in the Katrina floodwaters, Presley says.    Animal tissues sampled, including dead snakes and an alligator, also contained multiple metals and pesticides, but these levels were generally within an expected range and not likely to be caused by the hurricane, the researchers say. Of the 47 mosquito specimens collected in the study area, all tested negative for West Nile Virus and St. Louis Encephalitis, says Presley. But he cautions that virus-transmitting mosquito populations might increase in the spring and summer.  The researchers are planning to expand their sampling study to include additional cross-sections of the city, Presley says. The Institute of Environmental and Human Health at Texas Tech University and the Patent & Trademark Institute of America provided funding for this study.

{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_712", "content": "Or not -- Finding the answer may depend on the research of University of North Carolina at Charlotte environmental micropaleontologist Scott Hippensteel -- and on microscopic shells, barrier marshes and fiddler crabs.  The answer may be critical not just in weather forecasting, but in adjusting insurance rates, in preparing for future disasters and in guiding future environmental policy. Since climate science cannot yet accurately predict the future, the best way we can find these answers is to look at history (or \"prehistory\"). But how much history is there for us to look at?  \"Is the frequency of big storms going on now natural and should we expect this in the future?\" Hippensteel said. \"How much of this is anthropogenic? In trying to answer questions like these, what data do we have to compare our recent records  to?    \"We have 400 years of historical records, and about a century of real weather records. If you look at the coastal area that I'm doing research on, we've had one major hurricane -- a category 4 or 5 -- in the last 100 years. How do you adjust insurance rates based on one storm in 100 years? What we need is a much more extensive record -- maybe about 5,000 years worth of data.\"  There is, Hippensteel points out, a geological feature that records the past occurrence of major storms along the coasts -- the sediments left behind by massive tidal surges that wash, tsunami-like over the land. The trick, of course, is to find places where surge-caused layers of coastal sedimentation are consistently preserved and then to identify distinguishing details in the hurricane-caused layers.  One place where such preservation may have occurred are the back-barrier marshes off South Carolina's barrier islands -- low islands that protect these lowlands from regular erosion from the sea, yet also allow the ocean and its sand in when major storm events occur. In intervening times, the settling of sediment in the marsh lays down other protective layers.  In order to \"read\" the layers of marsh sediment and to distinguish between those laid down by normal weather cycles, Hippensteel uses foraminifera deposits -- a paleontological tool that in the past has been heavily used by geologists involved in oil exploration.   Foraminifera are single-celled organisms that produce easily identifiable shells, which are preserved in vast quantities in ocean and shore sediments. These organisms are very diverse and the populations of species are highly specific to the time and place in which they lived, leaving a clear marker in undisturbed sediments of the time period and locale of deposition.   Hippensteel reasoned that he could use the geological marking information offered by foraminifera deposits and apply it to a unique characteristic of powerful hurricanes -- their ability to dredge up off-shore ocean deposits.   In a study funded by the National Science Foundation, Hippensteel and University of Delaware geologist Ronald E. Martin analyzed sediment cores taken from a South Carolina back-barrier marsh and indeed found numerous layers that contained foraminifera that originated in off-shore water (results published in Topics in Geobiology, Vol. 15, 2000).  \"At Folly Island, South Carolina we found storm deposits that were interbedded with regular marsh muds. We knew that the deposits were left by hurricanes because they contain forams that only live in the off-shore environments,\" Hippensteel noted.   \"There is only one way that you could get layers of sand enriched with these forams, and that is a big hurricane dredges them up and throws them in the back barrier marshes. We used fossils as a tracer to prove the mode of deposition.\"  The foraminifera that Hippensteel found in the deposits include modern off-shore species and also species that were know to live off-shore in the Oligo-Miocene period (25-30 million years ago) and are known to be present in sediment deposits on the Carolinas continental shelf.   Hippensteel found the highest percentage of off-shore species in the thickest sandy layers of suspected storm sediment, which is consistent with the supposition that the biggest storms would both carry the most sand and also churn more of it from deeper water.   When the big storm layers were thus isolated in the Folly Island sediment cores,  the results had disturbing implications.  \"The record indicates that big storms have been less frequent in the last 1000 years than in the previous 2000 years before that,\" Hippensteel said. Recent layers contained far fewer layers of sand and very few layers containing significant numbers of off-shore foraminifera, compared with numerous such layers in the previous millennia.  Hippensteel cautions, however, that other environmental effects could be coloring this data. One big possible factor could be sediment-disturbing fiddler crabs, that might have only recently entered the area because of rising sea levels.  \"Fiddler crabs mix the surface layers of sediment,\" he said. \"If the sea level has been rising through time, we know that it is probable that our marshes have been getting muddier and muddier with more and more crabs. So if you think about it through time, the mixing is becoming more and more intense. The rising water may be making the recent record less certain.\"  The results shown in the foraminifera storm record are thus tantalizing but still uncertain, Hippensteel notes, and more work need to be done to verify the accuracy of the more recent layers.  \"Our records seem to show that we have been in a thousand year period of relative calm, but that result doesn't consider the possible destruction of the storm layers,\" he said.  \"Hurricanes may have been far more frequent before a thousand years ago ... but we really don't know yet. We need more data.\""}

In these confined quarters, Kirsch says, crowded and poor sanitary conditions, including  limited access to clean water and insufficient numbers of toilets, help spread disease from person to person.  However, Kirsch notes that people with chronic health conditions face the biggest threats by far, lacking immediate access to their routine medical services for hemodialysis, or access to medications for diabetes, heart disease, HIV or tuberculosis.  Kirsch, who went to the Gulf Coast area to conduct medical needs assessments for the American Red Cross, says constant monitoring and surveillance are required to contain disease outbreaks.  More importantly, he adds, improving the current public health care system so that it is strong enough to prevent disease through mass vaccinations and large enough to survive a natural disaster is the best means of guarding population health."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_714", "content": "The floodwaters that inundated New Orleans immediately following Hurricane Katrina were similar in content to the cityâs normal storm water and were not as toxic as previously thought, according to a study by researchers at Louisiana State University. Their study, the first peer-reviewed scientific assessment of the water quality of the Katrina floodwaters, is good news for those whoâve been exposed directly to the floodwaters, the scientists say.But the LSU researchers caution that the same floodwaters that were pumped back into Lake Pontchartrain contain high levels of some toxic metals, especially copper and zinc, and could pose a long-term danger to the areaâs aquatic life, which are more sensitive to the metals than humans. Their findings will appear in the Oct. 11 online issue of the American Chemical Societyâs journal Environmental Science & Technology.\"What we had in New Orleans was basically a yearâs worth of storm water flowing through the city in only a few days,\" says study leader John Pardue, Ph.D., an environmental engineer and director of the Louisiana Water Resources Research Institute at LSU in Baton Rouge. \"We still donât think the floodwaters were safe, but it could have been a lot worse. It was not the chemical catastrophe some had expected.\"Some experts had predicted that the floodwaters from Katrina could potentially destroy chemical plants and refineries in the area, releasing a deadly brew containing toxic levels of benzene, hydrochloric acid and chlorine. Instead, high levels of bacteria and viruses were the biggest human threat, not exposure to chemicals, Pardue and his associates say.The researchers obtained 38 floodwater samples from widespread sections of New Orleans, primarily in the area of the city known as the \"East Bank,\" where the main human contact with the floodwaters occurred. The samples, which included both surface waters and bottom samples, were taken within five to nine days after flooding occurred. Additional samples were also obtained from the 17th Street drainage canal, after pumping of the floodwater began, to evaluate the floodâs impact on Lake Pontchartrain, the receiving body for the pumped floodwaters.The researchers found high levels of bacteria, most likely from fecal contamination resulting from sewage. Levels were within the range of typical storm-water runoff in the city, the scientists say. They also detected high levels of lead, arsenic and chromium and noted that levels of these toxic metals were also similar to those typically found in the areaâs stormwater. In general, these particular findings were similar to those obtained by the Environmental Protection Agency in their initial assessment of the floodwaters, the researchers say.Gasoline was also a significant component of the floodwaters, as measured by elevated levels of three of its components: benzene, toluene and ethylbenzene. These compounds were somewhat elevated in comparison to typical stormwater runoff, the researchers say. The chemicals most likely came from cars and storage tanks submerged in the floodwaters, they add.Compounds found in common household chemicals were also detected in the floodwaters, Pardue says. The waters contained chemical compounds from aerosol paints, insecticides, caulking compounds, rubber adhesives and other common substances, they say, but at levels that typically do not create concern for human health.If the floodwaters had occurred in another location near more industrial sites in the city and if the wind damage or water surge had been more severe, then the resultant floodwaters could have been a more serious toxic threat, Pardue says. \"Instead, the city filled slowly, like a bathtub, and the water velocities and forces on the buildings, including chemical storage facilities, were relatively benign,\" he says. The large volume of floodwater also diluted the potency of many of the chemicals, he adds.While serious toxicity to human life was largely avoided, the floodwater may pose a chemical risk to aquatic life in the area, Pardue says. He believes that low oxygen levels in the water that is being pumped back into Lake Pontchartrain could result in fish kills. He also says that heavy metals being discharged into the lake, particularly copper and zinc, can be toxic to fish and other marine life and may bioaccumulate and contaminate seafood collected from the region. More studies are needed to assess the long-term impact of the flood on aquatic life, Pardue says.Funding for this study was provided by the Louisiana Water Resources Research Institute and the LSU Center for the Study of Public Health Impacts of Hurricanes.The American Chemical Society is a nonprofit organization, chartered by the U.S. Congress, with a multidisciplinary membership of more than 158,000 chemists and chemical engineers.

{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_715", "content": "CHAPEL HILL -- In the immediate wake of Hurricane Katrina, scientists and research centers from across the country came together to generate information on the contaminated floodwaters and offer it to hazardous materials experts and public health officials.In a matter of hours, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hillâs Marine Sciences Program and Renaissance Computing Institute (RENCI), together with the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA), played a key role in that effort by providing rapid-response computing and modeling capability.Floodwaters containing organic and chemical pollutants such as sewage and oil still cover swaths of Mississippi and Louisiana. To aid cleanup, researchers at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrationâs (NOAA) Coast Survey Development Laboratory (CSDL), along with UNC faculty, have been developing forecasts that will predict the circulation of those foul waters.A group of researchers, including Drs. Richard Luettich and Brian Blanton, marine scientists in UNCâs College of Arts and Sciences, has developed a three-dimensional computer program that can be used to model water levels and flow. This program, \"ADCIRC,\" is what experts call a hydrodynamic code. Previously, the code was used largely for after-the-fact analyses of coastal circulation, but researchers now believe it can help produce answers during a crisis.Blanton and Luettich, assistant research professor and professor of marine sciences, respectively, knew that to simulate the required 60 days of water velocity and water surface elevation they would need more computational power then they had at the university. They asked UNCâs Dr. Daniel A. Reed for help -- based on their NOAA--funded collaboration with RENCI -- to establish a computational system with Web access for rapid-response forecasting to severe weather.Reed is Chancellorâs Eminent professor and vice chancellor for information technology at UNC. North Carolinaâs 2005-06 budget includes $5.9 million in new funding for RENCI, a collaboration of UNC, Duke and NC State that is based on the Chapel Hill campus and run by Reed. RENCI is slated to receive $11.8 million in recurring funding thereafter.\"If we had a month to do these runs, we could do them on our desktop computers or on a small cluster, but to do it literally overnight requires some horsepower,\" Blanton said.Reed, former director of NCSA, connected Blanton and Leuttich with NCSA, the National Science Foundation-supported supercomputing center located at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Using NCSAâs Xeon system, a state-of-the-art parallel computer called Tungsten, the researchers were able to complete the required computational runs in about 15 hours, from midnight on Sept. 11 to mid-afternoon on Sept. 12.\"This is a prelude to the capabilities RENCI and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill will provide to North Carolina, as we deploy our own large-scale computing infrastructure and continue to build disaster-response collaborations with North Carolina experts,\" Reed said. \"With state support, we are now building world-class capability for interdisciplinary research, technology transfer, economic development and engagement across North Carolina.\"Researchers at CSDL, with assistance from Luettich and Blanton, are working to integrate information provided by the computational calculations with NOAAâs North American Mesoscale Model, the primary weather forecasting model used by the National Weather Service, to simulate wind speed, direction and other weather factors. Their goal is to provide daily forecasts of coastal circulation and pollutant concentrations in the Katrina-affected region, information that will be vital as cleanup efforts and recovery continue.The two also have extended their work with RENCI, Reed and colleagues to analyze various aspects of last weekendâs Hurricane Rita and its effects in Texas and Louisiana.\"We are trying to be prepared and generate reliable information that the hazardous materials experts will need to have,\" said CSDL scientist Jesse Feynen. \"We're doing that, and we're doing it quickly.\""}

ASAR measures thebackscatter, which is a measure of the roughness of the ocean surface.On a basic level, bright areas of the radar image mean higherbackscatter due to surface roughness. This roughness is stronglyinfluenced by the local wind field so that the radar backscatter can beused in turn to measure the wind.So the Center for SoutheasternTropical Advanced Remote Sensing at the University of Miami used thisASAR image to calculate the speed of Hurricane Rita's surface windfields â showing maximum wind speeds in excess of 200 kilometres perhour.\"The most detailed information about hurricane dynamics andcharacteristics are obtained from dedicated flights by hurricane hunteraircraft,\" explains Hans Graber of CSTARS. \"However these flightmissions cannot always take place.

As it continues west through the Gulf ofMexico it has weakened to a still-dangerous Category Four. Rita isexpected to make landfall on the Gulf coast during the morning of 24September.Thisinstrument works by firing a trio of high-frequency radar beams down tothe ocean, then analysing the pattern of backscatter reflected upagain. Wind-driven ripples on the ocean surface modify the radarbackscatter, and as the energy in these ripples increases with windvelocity, so backscatter increases as well. Scatterometer resultsenable measurements of not only wind speed but also direction acrossthe water surface.What makes ERS-2's scatterometer especiallyvaluable is that its C-band radar frequency is almost unaffected byheavy rain, so it can return useful wind data even from the heart ofthe fiercest storms â and is the sole scatterometer of this typecurrently in orbit.The ERS-2 Scatterometer results for HurricaneRita seen here have been processed by the Royal NetherlandsMeteorological Institute (KNMI). They are also routinely assimilated bythe European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF) intotheir advanced numerical models used for meteorological predictions.\"Scatterometerdata from the ERS-2 platform provide high-quality wind information inthe vicinity of tropical cyclones,\" states Hans Hersbach of ECMWF. \"Fora Hurricane like Rita, the combination of such observations with[in-situ] dropsonde data enables the analysis system at ECMWF toproduce an improved forecast.\"Near-real time radar altimetry is a powerful toolfor monitoring a hurricane's progress and predicting its potentialimpact.

Analyzing the strongestnorth-south current system in the world, the Agulhas Current off theeastern coast of South Africa, tells a much different story thanstudying the California Current, the north-south circulation of thenorth Pacific Ocean that travels just off California's waters.\"TheGDP observations are of great interest to people all over the world,\"said Niiler. \"If you want to know what's happening in your backyard, oryou want to know what's happening on a global basis, these data willassist you.\"When Niiler called a meeting of scientists inBoulder, Colo., in 1982, surface temperature readings and circulationpatterns were a mystery in large regions of the world, especially inthe Southern Ocean.\"A large part of the world simply could notbe sampled,\" said Niiler, \"because most of the world's ships don't gothere. We needed a new way.\"Niiler and his colleagues resolvedthat such gaps could only be filled with a completely new system ofobserving the entire Earth's oceans. They also decided that thismission could only be accomplished with the development of new oceaninstruments.With long-term support from Scripps, Niiler and hiscolleagues began to work with engineers in designing and developinglow-cost, rugged drifters that measure currents with high accuracy andrelay their sensor information through existing satellitecommunications systems. Scripps and Niiler eventually led the design,manufacture, deployment and research analysis of the program. YetScripps scientists could not do it all alone, Niiler stresses, andnational and international partners played a significant role in theprogram's development through organizations that include NOAA'sAtlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory, variousmeteorological groups, oceanographers from 20 countries and nearly allUnited States government research funding agencies. In the future, NOAAwill provide about 80 percent of the drifters to maintain the array.Althoughthe GDP has met its goal of populating the global ocean with 1,250drifters, the array of instruments has become so valuable to scienceand other applications that the network will continue to grow.Challenges associated with drifter deployments in areas rarely visitedby ships will be addressed by increasing future deployments by air.Drifters are now deployed by the United States Air Force's \"HurricaneHunter Squadron\" in front of hurricanes to obtain data on hurricanestrength and size.New ways of using the drifters as platformsfor environmental sensors also are being explored, includingmeasurements for rain, biochemical concentrations and surfaceconductivity."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_721", "content": "CHAPEL HILL â In the wake of Hurricane Katrina -- probably the greatest natural disaster in U.S. history -- a leading ecologist says that one of the best things that could happen to New Orleans and the rest of southern Louisiana and Mississippi would be more rain.\"People might think Iâm kidding, but Iâm not,\" said Dr. Seth R. Reice, associate professor of biology at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hillâs College of Arts and Sciences.\"The floodwater still covering much of New Orleans and elsewhere is full of everything people store under their sinks in their kitchens and bathrooms. Itâs also full of coliform bacteria from backed-up human waste, plus gasoline, oil and countless other pollutants. It is a really toxic stew.\"An intense rain would dilute the water and could make it possible to varying degrees for organisms -- both large and small -- to cope with it better, Reice said.Dilution is much needed, he said. Standing water in New Orleans streets was found late last week to carry 10 times the maximum safe level of fecal coliform bacteria to say nothing about the non-organic pollutants, the scientist said. He likened those streets to open sewers.Reice is the author of The Silver Lining, subtitled \"The Benefits of Natural Disasters.\" Published in 2001 by Princeton University Press, the book received much attention when it first appeared and later following the tsunamis in 2004 in the South Pacific and Indian Ocean.It details how, usually, hurricanes and lesser storms, volcanoes, earthquakes, floods and other apparently catastrophic events renew life and boost diversity in ecosystems throughout the world.But authorities in New Orleans are making a large mistake by pumping the floodwater into Lake Ponchartrain, Reice said.\"They have no business doing this,\" the biologist said. \"It is going to cause tremendous pollution and probably big fish kills. Instead, they should have pumped it as far out to sea as they could or at least into the Mississippi where the current would dilute it. Or they could have treated it in wastewater treatment plants. They over-reacted to the need to drain the streets and gave no thought to the severe environmental damage to the lake and its fishes.\"The second largest problem -- one that most Americans didnât realize until the hurricane -- is that New Orleans has been sinking for decades, Reice said. Thatâs because it was built on Mississippi Delta silt, which built up over millions of years by the sediments carried by the Mississippi River and deposited during floods. By isolating New Orleans from flooding, engineers robbed the delta of its sedimentary deposits.\"This natural disaster was partially the result of engineering designed to prevent flooding,\" he said. \"Natural flooding would have been less severe and would have allowed for a buildup of new sediments.\"Instead, what happened was that as the skyline rose, buildings got heavier and heavier and pushed the city downward into the soft earth, Reice said. The same is true for the entire Mississippi Delta region of southern Louisiana.\"What we are looking at now is a catastrophe for the shellfish industry since Louisiana oysters have become contaminated,\" he said. \"Would you want to eat fish from Lake Ponchartrain or shellfish from the Gulf anytime soon? I certainly wouldnât.\"The scale of this thing is simply enormous and, of course, we had essentially no emergency preparedness for it,\" Reice said. \"Perhaps one of the few positive things that will come out of the Hurricane Katrina disaster is that voters and politicians will start paying more attention to the environment.\"The biologist said the American people share part of the blame for what happened in Louisiana and Mississippi since they keep buying gas-guzzling automobiles that waste gasoline and contribute heavily to global warming. He considers SUVs, for example, a \"crime against nature.\"\"American automakers have the capacity to build fuel-efficient cars, but they just wonât do it because the federal government puts no pressure on them,\" Reice said. \"In Europe, people have been paying $5 a gallon of gasoline for years. Do I resent $3 a gallon for gas here? Not a bit. I say put a tax on it to get the price up to $4 a gallon because we have got to stop wasting fuel.\"Among the UNC scientistâs recommendations are to get researchers out to Lake Ponchartrain to assess insults to that vast body of water, which could take years to recover completely. He recommends developing an ecological remediation plan for it and for the coastal zone as well. He also said he believes FEMA should be taken out of Homeland Security and led by an expert with cabinet-level authority.\"We need an almost radical reconsideration of nature and a resolve not to muck things up as we have in the past,\" he said. \"Just about every time we get in the way of nature, we create more problems for nature and for ourselves.\"Among topics Reice tackles in his book are how paving over the landscape for malls, subdivisions and highways leads to more frequent and severe flooding of urban streams.Niles Eldredge of the American Museum of Natural History called The Silver Lining highly accessible and said \"the chapters on fire and floods are brilliant.\""}

The study was supportedby the National Science Foundation (NSF), NCAR's primary sponsor.\"What we found was rather astonishing,\" said Webster. \"In the 1970s,there was an average of about 10 Category 4 and 5 hurricanes per yearglobally. Since 1990, the number of Category 4 and 5 hurricanes hasalmost doubled, averaging 18 per year globally.\"Category 4 hurricanes have sustained winds from 131 to 155 miles perhour; Category 5 systems, such as Hurricane Katrina at its peak overthe Gulf of Mexico, feature winds of 156 mph or more.\"This long period of sustained intensity change provides anexcellent basis for further work to understand and predict thepotential responses of tropical cyclones to changing environmentalconditions\", said NCAR's Holland.\"Category 4 and 5 storms are also making up a larger share of thetotal number of hurricanes,\" said Curry, chair of the School of Earthand Atmospheric Sciences at Georgia Tech and coauthor of the study.\"Category 4 and 5 hurricanes made up about 20% of all hurricanes in the1970s, but over the last decade they accounted for about 35% of thesestorms.\"The largest increases in the number of intense hurricanes occurredin the North Pacific, Southwest Pacific, and the North and South IndianOceans, with slightly smaller increases in the North Atlantic Ocean.All this is happening as sea surface temperatures have risen acrossthe globe between one-half and one degree Fahrenheit, depending on theregion, for hurricane seasons since the 1970s.\"Our work is consistent with the concept that there is arelationship between increasing sea surface temperature and hurricaneintensity,\" said Webster. \"However, it's not a simple relationship. Infact, it's difficult to explain why the total number of hurricanes andtheir longevity has decreased during the last decade, when sea surfacetemperatures have risen the most.\"\"NCAR is now embarking on a focused series of computer experimentscapable of resolving thunderstorms and the details of tropicalcyclones,\" said Holland. \"The results will help explain the observedintensity changes and extend them to realistic climate changescenarios.\"The only region that is experiencing more hurricanes and tropicalcyclones overall is the North Atlantic, where they have become morenumerous and longer-lasting, especially since 1995. The North Atlantichas averaged eight to nine hurricanes per year in the last decade,compared to six to seven per year before the increase. Category 4 and 5hurricanes in the North Atlantic have increased at an even faster clip:from 16 in the period of 1975-89 to 25 in the period of 1990-2004, arise of 56%.A study published in July in the journal Nature came to a similarconclusion. Focusing on North Atlantic and North Pacific hurricanes,Kerry Emanuel (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) found an increasein their duration and power, although his study used a differentmeasurement to determine a storm's power.But whether all of this is due to human-induced global warming isstill uncertain, said Webster. \"We need a longer data record ofhurricane statistics, and we need to understand more about the rolehurricanes play in regulating the heat balance and circulation in theatmosphere and oceans.\"\"Basic physical reasoning and climate model simulations andprojections motivated this study,\" said Jay Fein, director of NSF'sclimate and large scale dynamics program, which funded the research.\"These results will stimulate further research into the complex naturaland anthropogenic processes influencing these tropical cyclone trendsand characteristics.\"Webster is currently attempting to determine the basic role ofhurricanes in the climate of the planet. \"The thing they do more thananything is cool the oceans by evaporating the water and thenredistributing the oceans' tropical heat to higher latitudes,\" he said.\"But we don't know a lot about how evaporation from the oceansurface works when the winds get up to around 100 miles per hour, asthey do in hurricanes,\" said Webster, who adds that this physicalunderstanding will be crucial to connecting trends in hurricaneintensity to overall climate change.\"If we can understand why the world sees about 85 named storms ayear and not, for example, 200 or 25, then we might be able to say thatwhat we're seeing is consistent with what we'd expect in a globalwarming scenario. Without this understanding, a forecast of the numberand intensity of tropical storms in a future warmer world would bemerely statistical extrapolation.\"NCAR Tip Sheet: Hurricane Prediction, Behavior, and Impacts -- Georgia Institute of Technology - School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences --"}

{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_725", "content": "\"Deadly diseases, such as typhoid or cholera, are unlikely to break out after hurricanes and floods in areas where these diseases do not already naturally occur,\" says Ruth Berkelman, MD, Chair of the Public and Scientific Affairs Board of the American Society for Microbiology. \"The greatest threats to the people in the affected areas are going to be from diseases that were already there.\"  Dr. Berkelman is the Rollins Professor and Director of the Center for Public Health Preparedness and Research at the Rollins School of Public Health at Emory University. She is a former Assistant Surgeon General of the United States and former deputy director of the CDC's National Center for Infectious Diseases (NCID).  Common infectious disease problems in New Orleans in the coming weeks are likely to be skin and soft-tissue infections, most likely from cuts, abrasions and wounds. The primary culprits will be Staphylococcus and Streptococcus bacteria, both of which can generally be treated with available antibiotics. Diseases caused by consumption of contaminated food or water as well as diseases caused by mosquitoes or other insect bites are also a threat.  Vibrio vulnificus can also cause serious infections, either wound infections or blood poisoning (septicemia); V. vulnificus is a bacterium that is normally present in Gulf Coast waters and is usually contracted by eating tainted seafood. It is primarily a threat to people with weakened immune systems or liver dysfunction. The CDC has confirmed 15 infections with V. vulnificus, 3 of which were fatal. These cases have occurred in areas other than New Orleans where the water has greater salinity.  Another concern is diarrhea and gastrointestinal illnesses from the flood waters. Short bouts of diarrhea and upset stomachs sometimes occur after natural disasters and can be caused sewage contamination of the water. Although at high levels in floodwaters, the E. coli found in New Orleans is the type commonly associated with fecal contamination and is not the E. coli H7:O157 strain that can cause serious kidney disease and bloody diarrhea.  \"At this point in time, I think it is just common sense to continue drinking only bottled water unless authorities have tested the water now being piped into some facilities and have declared it safe to drink,\" says Berkelman. \"To also prevent risk of infection, people should practice basic hygiene, frequently washing their hands with soap and clean water or disinfecting hands with an alcohol-based hand cleaner. Individuals should not eat food that has been exposed to flood waters or that has not been properly refrigerated.\"  One common misperception is that the body of a person who died as the result of the hurricane and is still in the city poses a risk of infection.  \"Decaying bodies pose very little risk for major disease outbreaks,\" says Berkelman. Furthermore, mosquitoes do not spread disease by feeding on dead bodies. There is, however, a risk of mosquito-borne diseases such as West Nile because mosquitoes breed in standing water. Appropriate pest management, including addressing the need to get rid of standing water, is an important public health measure, she said. A bacterial disease, leptospirosis, may be caused by exposure to water contaminated by rodent urine and can be treated successfully with antibiotics.  Over the long term, mold may also pose a threat. Mold growth is an indicator of excess moisture, and much will need to be done to dry out New Orleans and clean up mold growth. Some environmental molds can cause allergic reactions.

Within two hours, the responders had the data form the UAVs showing that no survivors were trapped and that the flood waters from the cresting Pearl River were not posing an additional threat.\"Katrina was so much worse than Charley,\" added Murphy. \"Even though Charley cut a wide swath through Florida, only a few houses in a neighborhood were totally destroyed and a few lucky ones looked largely untouched.

Moreover, this marked increasein the energy release has occurred in both the north Atlantic and thenorth Pacific Oceans.Unlike previous studies, which have focused on whether hurricanesare becoming more frequent, Emanuel's study is one of the first to askwhether they are becoming more fierce.\"It's an innovative application of a theoretical concept, and hasproduced a new analysis of hurricanes' strength and destructivepotential,\" says Jay Fein, director of the National Science Foundation(NSF)'s climate dynamics program, which funded the research. And thatanalysis, in turn, \"has resulted in an important measure of thepotential impact of hurricanes on social, economic and ecologicalsystems,\"Indeed, as Emanuel himself says, \"the near doubling of hurricane'spower over the period of record should be a matter of some concern, asit's a measure of the [future] destructive potential of these storms.\"Also of concern, he says, is that the increases in storm intensityare mirrored by increases in the average temperatures at the surface ofthe tropical oceans, suggesting that this warming is responsible forthe hurricanes' greater power. Since hurricanes depend on warm water toform and build, Emanuel warns that global climate change might increasethe effect of hurricanes still further in coming years.In addition, he says, recent research suggests that global tropicalhurricane activity may play a role in driving the oceans' circulation,which in turn has important \"feedbacks\" to regional and global climate.Fluctuations in tropical hurricane activity \"are of obviousimportance to society,\" he adds, \"especially as populations of affectedareas increase. Hurricanes account for a significant fraction ofdamage, injury and loss of life from natural hazards, and are thecostliest natural catastrophes in the United States. As the humanpopulation in coastal regions gets denser, the damage and casualtiesproduced by more intense storms could increase considerably in thefuture.\""}

Patrick Arnott of the DesertResearch Institute (DRI) in Reno, Nev.; and David O. Starr of NASA'sGoddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Md., co-authored a paper aboutHurricane Nora's far-reaching effects. The paper was published in theApril 1, 2003, issue of the American Meteorological Society's Journalof Atmospheric Sciences.Scientists were surprised to find what appeared to be frozenplankton in some cirrus crystals collected by research aircraft overOklahoma, far from the Pacific Ocean. This was the first time examplesof microscopic marine life, like plankton, were seen as \"nuclei\" of icecrystals in the cirrus clouds of a hurricane.Nora formed off the Panama coast, strengthened as it traveled up theBaja Peninsula, and the hurricane crossed into California in September1997. Over the western U.S., Nora deposited a stream of high cirrus,ice crystal, clouds that created spectacular optical effects, such asarcs and halos, above a broad region including Utah and Oklahoma. Thatstream of cirrus clouds enabled researchers to analyze growth of icecrystals from different nuclei.Different nuclei, like sulfate particles, sea salt and desert dust,affect ice-crystal growth and shape. Torn from the sea surface bystrong hurricane winds, sea salt and other particles from evaporatedsea spray are carried to the cold upper troposphere in storm updrafts,where the drops freeze and become ice crystals. Plankton, a microscopicorganism, is also likely present in the sea spray and is similarlylofted to high levels.\"Understanding how ice crystals grow and what determines theirshapes is important in understanding how they interact with sunlightand infrared energy,\" Starr noted. \"These interactions are importantprocesses in the global climate system. They are also critical tosensing cloud properties from space, where NASA uses measurements ofthe reflected solar radiation to infer cloud physical properties, suchas ice-crystal size,\" he said.Data were gathered using ground-based remote sensors at the Facilityfor Atmospheric Remote Sensing in Salt Lake City and at the Clouds andRadiation Testbed in northern Oklahoma. A research aircraft collectedparticle samples over Oklahoma. Observations from the GeostationaryOperational Environmental Satellite 9 (West), launched by NASA andoperated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, werealso used. DRI analyzed the ice crystals collected from Nora.Scientists were using data generated through the U.S. Department ofEnergy (DOE) Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Program. The ARMProgram's purpose is obtaining field measurements and developingcomputer models of the atmosphere. Researchers hope to betterunderstand the processes that control the transfer of solar and thermalinfrared energy in the atmosphere, especially in clouds, and at theEarth's surface.The ARM energy measurements also double-check data from the ModerateImaging Spectroradiometer instrument aboard NASA's Terra and Aquasatellites. By ensuring the satellites are recording the same energyreflected and absorbed by clouds from Hurricane Nora as those providedby the ground data in this study, scientists hope to take fewer groundmeasurements in the future, and enable the satellites to provide thedata.The DOE ARM program, National Science Foundation, and NASA's EarthScience Enterprise funded this research.

RAINEX scientistswill investigate one of those factors: the interactions betweenhurricane rainbands and the eyewall. \"From RAINEX, we will betterunderstand the impact of rainbands on a hurricane's maximum winds,\" hesaid.While researchers have studied the eye and outer rainbands ofhurricanes extensively, \"few, if any, experiments have ever examinedthese two components together and how their interaction might affect astorm's strength,\" said Shuyi Chen, a meteorologist and physicaloceanographer at RSMAS and a RAINEX principal investigator. \"The outerbands of a hurricane often have strong winds and lots of rain, and thatcan actually affect the overall intensity of a hurricane,\" she said.RAINEX will study this interaction using data recorded fromhurricane research flights.

RSMAS will construct astate-of-the-art hurricane model using the data collected from theresearch flights.\"These flights can be turbulent, especially when we're penetrating ahurricane's rainbands,\" said NCAR scientist Wen-Chau Lee. \"I thinkthat's the wild card, the challenge of the experiment: to captureinternal rainband structure and its interactions with the eye wall inthose conditions.\"\"We hope to find an explanation for why a hurricane changes inintensity, from the relationship between the inner and outer parts ofthe storm,\" said Robert Houze, an atmospheric scientist at theUniversity of Washington and a RAINEX co-principal investigator. \"Thesestorms can jump up in intensity, or drop a full category in a day, abig challenge.\"Flying in the hurricane's outer bands and into the eye wall,scientists aboard the aircraft will use sophisticated Doppler radar andGPS dropsondes to record wind speed and direction, temperature,humidity, atmospheric pressure and other critical data.Much of what scientists currently know about the interaction betweenthe outer rainbands and the eye wall of a hurricane comes from thestate-of-the-art numerical models developed for hurricane research andprediction, which can provide very detailed information but may not becompletely accurate.Researchers need solid data to validate these models, they say. \"Weneed to know whether or not our models are accurate, and the data wecollect from RAINEX will give us the information we need,\" Chen said.Once the data are collected, the researchers will all analyze andshare this information with hurricane operational centers and nationalenvironmental prediction centers throughout the country, and the world."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_736", "content": "In a \"proof of concept\" study of the oxygen isotopes found in thecellulose of late-season growth in annual growth rings from pine treesnear Valdosta, Georgia, a team led by Claudia Mora found they couldidentify all known hurricanes that hit the area over the past fiftyyears. But that's just the beginning, says Mora, who is scheduled topresent some of her team's findings on Thursday, 11 August, at EarthSystem Processes 2, a meeting co-convened by the Geological Society ofAmerica and Geological Association of Canada this week in Calgary,Alberta, Canada. \"We've taken it back 100 years and didn't miss astorm,\" said Mora. Since a century is a very short time when it comes to climatechange, she and her team applied their new technique to old trees fromother parts of the Southeastern US and found a tropical cyclone recordspanning 227 years. They've even found additional climate informationgoing back as far as 1450 AD. \"What we're trying to do is understand frequency of hurricanesand how variable their occurrence is over the long-term,\" said Mora.\"We're trying to come up with a reliable way to establish this.\" Mora's group divided each individual annual tree ring in thetrees into early-year and late-year growth. That way they could isolatethe late-year hurricane season. Then they searched all the woodytissues for any sudden drops in a particular oxygen isotope: oxygen-18.That is the hurricane signal, Mora said. What makes drops in oxygen-18 so telling is that it matches up with alittle known talent of all hurricanes: they are very good at depletingthe air of oxygen-18, Mora says. Consequently, there are unusually lowconcentrations of oxygen-18 in the water that rains out of hurricanes.So when shallow roots of Southeastern trees like the longleaf pine andslash pine suck up that low-O-18 hurricane rain water, the same unusualisotopic signal is preserved in the woody tree cells that start growingas soon as the sun breaks through the storm clouds.The trees pick up the storm water in the dozen or so daysimmediately after the storm, according to what other researchers havelearned about how pines exploit rainwater, says Mora. Of course, not every hurricane drops rain on Valdosta,Georgia, says Mora. So to get a fuller picture of hurricane frequenciesher team has already begun looking at and searching for more locationsand old living trees or well-preserved dead trees in the SoutheasternUS , she said. The matter of hurricane frequency has taken on greaterimportance recently as the Eastern US is seeing more hurricanes andclimate researchers have begun asserting that there's reason to believeglobal warming - at least partially human-influenced - may be causingthe increase. The best way to differentiate natural from anthropogenicincreases in hurricane occurrence is to have a long history ofhurricanes and other tropical cyclones to compare with, Mora explains."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_737", "content": "The possibility of a super wave is often suggested by anecdotalevidence such as damage caused by Hurricane Ivan in September of 2004to an offshore rig in the Gulf of Mexico that was nearly 80 feet abovethe ocean surface. Hence, some of the destruction done by Ivan has beenattributed to a rogue wave.According to industry and national weather sources, the damage doneby waves during Ivan has been on the extreme high end for a category 4hurricane. Ivan has been the most expensive hurricane ever for the oiland gas industry in the Gulf. The Minerals Management Service (MMS)reported that Ivan amazingly forced evacuation of 75% of the mannedplatforms in the Gulf (574 platforms) and 59% of the drilling rigs (69rigs), set adrift 5 rigs and sunk 7 rigs entirely. However, the damageby Hurricane Ivan in the oil fields in the Gulf cannot be measured byhow many platforms or rigs were destroyed. The most costly damage isbelieved to have been made to the underwater pipelines. Aside fromobvious leaks, some pipelines were reported to have moved 3000 ft whileothers were buried under 30 feet of mud and cannot be found. The mostextensive damage to the pipelines is attributed to undersea mudslides(equivalent to a snow avalanche) and to extreme waves. The completefindings of this study are published in the August 5, 2005 issue ofScience. During NRL's Slope to Shelf Energetics and Exchange Dynamics (SEED)field experiment, six current profiler moorings that also containedwave/tide gauges (Sea-Bird Electronics SBE 26) were deployed on thecontinental shelf at water depths ranging between 60 and 90 meters justwest of the DeSoto Canyon, about 100 miles south of Mobile Bay,Alabama. An additional eight deep moorings were deployed down the shelfslope but did not contain wave/tide gauges. Fortuitously, between 8:00pm CDST and midnight on September 15, the eye of Ivan passed throughthe center of the array, and almost directly over moorings 2, 5, 8, and11. Historically, instruments in the ocean do not even survive nearmisses of such powerful storms, much less direct hits. Fortunately, allof the SEED moorings survived this powerful storm, and provided thebest ocean measurements of currents and waves ever obtained directlyunder a major hurricane.  During the approach of Ivan, a moored buoy (ID 42040),deployed by the National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) near the west side ofthe SEED array, registered a significant wave height of 16.0 meters (53ft). Unfortunately, the NDBC buoy broke loose and was set adrift onSeptember 15 at 5:00 pm CDST, just before the arrival of the main forceof the hurricane. According to a spokesman at NDBC, this wave heightappears to be the largest ever reported by NDBC from a hurricane andcomes within a few tenths of a meter of NDBC's all-time record reportedin the North Pacific.Note that the wave heights reported by the NDBC buoys are derivedfrom wave spectra. Buoy measurements do not report time series ofsurface wave elevations, and hence, maximum individual wave heights canonly be statistically postulated from spectrum-derived significant waveheights. The SEED wave/tide gauges, however, provided direct timeseries measurements of surface wave elevations. The maximum individualcrest-to-trough wave heights can be reliably obtained. At mooring 3,located under the most intense winds, the maximum measured wave heightwas 27.7 meters (91 feet) which was part of a group of large waves withperiods of approximately 10 seconds where several waves reached heightsof about 20 meters (66 feet).These waves recorded by the NRL SEED gauges are by far the largestwaves ever directly measured. Even larger waves could have been missedentirely on the shelf since the surface wave data from the SEED gaugeswere not closely sampled in time, but were instead sampled at 1 hertzover a 512 second data burst only every 8 hours. Analysis of the wavedata with the winds suggests that the wave heights likely exceeded 130feet near the eye wall of the hurricane. Orbital wave velocitiesgenerated by such large waves during Hurricane Ivan (not rogue waves)exceeded 2 meters/second at the ocean bottom (in addition tolower-frequency measured currents that exceeded 1 meter/second) andcould certainly have caused much damage to underwater structures andpipelines.The measurement of \"super waves\" cannot be planned and are indeedvery rare. These in-situ measurements made by NRL directly under acategory 4 hurricane are very valuable since they can be used toprovide an assessment of potential impacts to offshore structures andoperations by energetic storm waves."}

Johnson, USAF (Ret.), director ofthe NOAA National Weather Service. \"This may well be one of the mostactive Atlantic hurricane seasons on record, and will be the ninthabove-normal Atlantic hurricane season in the last eleven years.\"\"Although we have already seen a record-setting seven tropicalstorms during June and July, much of the season's activity is still tocome,\" said Gerry Bell, lead meteorologist on NOAA's Atlantic HurricaneSeasonal Outlook. The predicted high levels of activity during theremainder of the season are consistent with NOAA's pre-season outlookissued last spring, and are comparable to those seen during August toOctober of the very active 2003 and 2004 seasons.Atmospheric and oceanic conditions that favor an active hurricaneseason are now in place, as was predicted in the pre-season outlook.\"Warmer-than-normal sea-surface temperatures and low wind shear areamong the culprits behind these stronger and more numerous storms,\"Bell added.This confluence of optimal ocean and atmosphere conditions has beenknown to produce increased tropical storm activity in multi-decadal(approximately 20-30 year) cycles. Because of this, NOAA expects acontinuation of above-normal seasons for another decade or perhapslonger. NOAA's research shows that this reoccurring cycle is thedominant climate factor that controls Atlantic hurricane activity. Anypotentially weak signal associated with longer-term climate changeappears to be a minor factor.The multi-decadal signal that has contributed to increased Atlanticactivity since 1995 has also produced a marked decrease in hurricanesin the eastern Pacific hurricane region. Similar conditions alsoproduced very active Atlantic hurricane seasons during the 1950s and1960s. In contrast, the opposite phase of this signal during 1970-1994resulted in only three above-normal Atlantic hurricane seasons in theentire 25-year period.Conditions that steer hurricanes toward land are well known, but aredifficult to predict on seasonal time scales and are often related todaily weather patterns. However, historical records indicate that anaverage of two to three additional hurricanes could strike the U.S.between August and November.\"Knowing precisely where a hurricane will strike and at whatintensity cannot be determined even a few days in advance,\" said MaxMayfield, director of the NOAA National Hurricane Center. Mayfieldadds, \"Residents and government agencies of coastal and near-coastalregions should embrace hurricane preparedness efforts and should beready well before a tropical storm or hurricane watch is posted.\"An average Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from June 1 throughNovember 30, produces 10 named storms in which six become hurricanes,including two major hurricanes with winds of at least 111 mph. The mostactive hurricane season was in 1933 with 21 storms, followed by 1995with 19 storms. The most hurricanes in a season was 12 in 1969, and thehighest number of major hurricanes was eight in 1950.The 2005 Atlantic hurricane outlook is a joint product of scientistsat NOAA's Climate Prediction Center, Hurricane Research Division andNational Hurricane Center.

{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_739", "content": "According to a new study by two University of California, Berkeley, mathematicians and their Russian colleague, the water droplets kicked up by rough seas serve to lubricate the swirling winds of hurricanes and cyclones, letting them build to speeds approaching 200 miles per hour. Without the lubricating effect of the spray, the mathematicians estimate, winds would rise to little more than 25 miles per hour.  \"This is not a small effect,\" said Alexandre Chorin, professor of mathematics at UC Berkeley and faculty researcher at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL). He and fellow UC Berkeley mathematics professor Grigory I. Barenblatt, also of LBNL, along with V. M. Prostokishin of the Shirshov Institute of Oceanology in Moscow, published their analysis of the effect of ocean spray in the Early Online Edition of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.  Over the past decade, the three mathematicians have developed a body of equations to describe turbulence in fluids and have applied these equations to many practical problems. Turbulence slows flowing liquids or gases by generating eddies, swirls and vortices, and thus plays a role in keeping airplanes aloft, slowing ships and taming rivers.  \"Turbulence is generally a good thing,\" Chorin said, noting that without turbulence the Mississippi River at its mouth would be flowing at supersonic speed. \"You need turbulence to make friction stronger.\"  The equations, when applied to a cloud of water droplets sandwiched between flowing air and water, indicate that large water droplets thrown up by cresting waves in rough seas inhibit the turbulence in the air over the ocean. Without this turbulence to drain energy from the swirling winds, winds can build to tremendous speeds. Without turbulence, friction between the air and water would be reduced by a factor of 1,000, Chorin said, sometimes allowing winds to rise to speeds eight times greater than would be the case with turbulence.  The turbulent vortices in the air are suppressed by the droplets when they rain back into the sea, somewhat like \"combing unruly hair,\" Chorin said. These droplets are about 20 microns across (8 ten-thousandths of an inch) or larger.  The smaller the droplets, the less ability they have to suppress the turbulence, he said, which suggests one way to calm hurricanes.  \"If you could develop a detergent to reduce the size of the droplets, you might be able to stop a hurricane,\" he said. \"That's not as far fetched as it sounds. In ancient times, sailors carried oil to pour out on the water to calm storms. Pouring oil on choppy waters was not a superstition.\"  In their paper, the mathematicians conclude that \"We think that the action of oil was exactly the prevention of the formation of droplets! The turbulence was restored after the oil was dropped, the turbulent drag increased, and the intensity of the squall was reduced. Possibly hurricanes can be similarly prevented or damped by having airplanes deliver fast decaying harmless surfactants to the right places on the sea surface.\"  The team began working on the problem after a colleague, Sir M. James Lighthill, suggested to Barenblatt at a party that drops in ocean spray might have a lubricating effect on hurricane winds. Hurricanes or, more properly, tropical cyclones, form at low-pressure areas over warm, tropical oceans. Swirling air is accelerated by energy from the warm water.  Lighthill was unable to solve the problem before his untimely swimming death in 1998, but his friends took on the task employing their turbulence models. The paper is dedicated to \"the great mathematician and fluid mechanician Sir James Lighthill.\"  Whereas Lighthill thought that evaporation of the droplets cooled the atmosphere and led to accelerated winds, Chorin, Barenblatt and Prostokishin have showed that more important is the reduction of turbulence by falling droplets. Nevertheless, they note that evaporative cooling also serves to reduce turbulence and thus allow winds to build. The work was supported by the U. S. Department of Energy"}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_740", "content": "Scientists at NASA have developed a way to process radar data from NASA and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency's (JAXA) Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite that can help with forecasting changes in a hurricane's intensity.\"What's important is that the vertical rain structure data used to take a longer time to process,\" said Jeffrey Halverson, Meteorologist and TRMM Education and Outreach Scientist. With hurricane forecasts, events change quickly, and meteorologists need data as fast as possible. This new process gives them data within three hours from the time the satellite has flown over a tropical cyclone.\"TRMM is a unique satellite that is able to estimate rainfall measurements from space, and rainfall is a key ingredient in hurricanes. For example, heaviest concentrations of rainfall for example are found around the eye or center of the hurricane. Scientists can tell, based on if the rain is getting stronger or weaker, whether or not the hurricane is strengthening or weakening.In 2004, research confirmed that when larger towering clouds reach a certain height surrounding the hurricane's open eye, in what is called the \"eye-wall,\" they can be associated with a strengthening storm. TRMM can identify these \"hot towers\" of piled up clouds and cam help make forecasts more accurate.Because the TRMM satellite covers the tropical areas of the entire globe, the Precipitation Radar (PR) instrument takes snapshots of storms as it passes by. Every time it passes over a named tropical cyclone anywhere in the world, the PR will send data to create these 3-D \"snapshots\" of the storms.The hurricane snapshot will show forecasters information on how heavy the rain is falling from different parts of the storm, such as the in eye-wall versus the outer rainbands, for example. It also gives a 3-D look at the cloud heights and \"hot towers\" inside the storm. Higher hot towers around the eye usually indicate a strengthening storm.The snapshot also gives valuable information about how the storm is put together. For example, when scientists studying a snapshot see that the body of the hurricane may be tilted inward to the hot towers, it could give clues as to whether a wind shear, or a sudden change in direction of winds near the top of the storm, may impact the storm's strength. Normally, when a hurricane runs into a strong wind shear, it weakens.Forecasters and the general public can access the data and look into the eye of a storm by going to the TRMM website. The website can be found at: http://trmm.gfsc.nasa.gov.\"We hope this new data product will help the community to better assess the structure and intensity of tropical cyclones,\" Halverson said."}

{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_742", "content": "UF engineering researchers have completed one of the most extensive studies of how homes built before and after Florida's latest building code held up against Charley, Frances, Jeanne and Ivan.  Their conclusion: Homes built under the Florida Building Code that became effective in 2002 sustained less damage on average than those built between 1994 and 2001 under the Standard Building Code. Homes completed before 1994, meanwhile, fared worse.   \"The iterations and changes over the years to the codes Florida uses have made a measurable difference,\" said Kurt Gurley, a UF associate professor of civil engineering and the lead investigator on the project.  The engineers, whose study of 200 homes was funded with a $90,000 grant from the Florida Building Commission through the Florida Department of Community Affairs, present their report today at the FBC's meeting in St. Petersburg. A subcommittee will mull the study as well as other research and information to help steer recommendations for possible new code changes later this year.  The UF research is important because it demonstrates that quality codes are a key part of the prescription against hurricane damage, said Jeff Burton, building code manager at the Tampa-based Institute for Business & Home Safety, a building safety advocacy group whose engineering experts participated in the study. That's especially true outside Florida, already considered the nation's leader in wind protection codes, Burton said.  \"Comparatively speaking, there are other states that have no codes that have a high probability of a hurricane making landfall,\" he said. \"In my line of work, I go to various states and try to educate them. Unless you have proof that they need codes, number one, and number two, that they actually work, it's a hard sell.\"  Gurley's team, which also included engineers from Florida International University and Florida A&M University, compared homes in the path of the highest wind zones generated by the hurricanes.   The study did not formally include homes built before 1994, when the Standard Building Code's high wind standard became widely used in coastal areas. However, the researchers got a good idea of damage to pre-1994 homes as a result of their visits to storm-damaged neighborhoods.  The engineers interviewed homeowners, examined photos and other records of damage and inspected homes for construction method -- noting, for example, the size and spacing of nails used to affix roofing plywood to rafters. Besides Gurley, the UF team included civil engineering graduate student Rob Davis, Jimmy Jesteadt, Sean-Paul Ferrera, Ryan Chancey, and Luis Aponte, as well as undergraduate students.   Among the group's findings: Shingle-roofed homes built under the 2002 code retained more asphalt shingles than homes built under the 1994 code. Retaining shingles is critical in hurricanes because loss of too many can compromise the roof, allowing rain to enter the attic and living space. The new code requires shingles rated to withstand higher winds than the previous code.  In Charlotte County, for example, nearly 30 percent of the surveyed homes built under the new code that faced Hurricane Charley's highest recorded wind gusts -- as high as 150 mph -- had no shingle damage. But every surveyed home built under the previous code experienced at least some shingle loss. Among those homes that did lose shingles, meanwhile, very few surveyed new homes experienced a loss of more than 10 percent. But 10 percent was the minimum for older homes, with many losing far higher percentages. The benefits of the more rugged roof are clear in the study, but it can be tricky to determine the relative effects of code improvements from other issues such as aging, Gurley added.  The team also found that a recent requirement for reinforced garage doors proved very effective. Most of the homes surveyed were built with this requirement, and none had significant garage door damage. However, researchers saw many pre-1994 homes whose weaker garage doors were blown off their tracks, a failure that often allowed wind to enter the house, damage the contents and attack the integrity of the roof from inside.  Despite the noticeable improvement in performance among new homes versus old homes, homes built under the newest code did not survive unscathed, Gurley said. Common failures among new homes include soffits, or vents located underneath roof overhangs to allow air to circulate through the attic. Wind sometimes damaged or blew out these soffits, allowing wind-driven rain to enter the attic, soaking insulation and even damaging ceilings and home contents in some cases, Gurley said.  Gurley said improving soffit performance is one area the Florida Building Commission will likely tackle in its next set of code revisions, among other issues. He said his research shows that although there will never be a perfect building code, Florida has a good track record of improving standards."}

Engineers at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) in Boulder, Colo., helped build the DOW, which is funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF).Most Doppler radars transmit only a single beam, which takes about five minutes to make the vertical and horizontal scans needed for a three-dimensional storm portrait. But tornadoes can develop or dissipate in a minute or less. With its five- to 10-second resolution, the Rapid-Scan DOW can detail these critical steps in tornado behavior at close range.\"The development of the multi-beam mobile Doppler radar is an important advance in meteorological research,\" says Steve Nelson, director of NSF's physical and dynamic meteorology program, which funded the research. \"This new radar will collect higher resolution data than were possible in the past, giving us unique measurements of rapidly evolving meteorological phenomena like tornadoes.\"The first DOW was deployed in 1995. Since then, Wurman and his colleagues have collected data on more than 100 tornadoes. On May 3, 1999, a DOW measured a world-record wind speed of 301 miles per hour just above ground level in an Okla. tornado.As part of a $1.6 million NSF grant, Wurman and Curtis Alexander of the University of Oklahoma are analyzing the entire DOW data set on tornadoes to uncover new information, such as how closely tornado diameters are correlated with top wind speeds.\"We can't answer basic questions about 'typical' tornadoes right now, such as how strong their winds are,\" says Wurman. \"By looking at these cases, we hope to better understand the features of many types of tornadoes.\" These findings could be compared to storm types to produce improved warnings, Wurman adds.Wurman and NCAR scientists plan to select a few tornadoes for more in-depth study. They'll use a technique called velocity track display (VTD), originally developed for hurricane studies, that allows scientists to extract three-dimensional wind information from a single Doppler radar.The scientists have already used VTD with DOW data to analyze a large and intense tornado that struck Mulhall, Okla., in 1999. They discovered a central downdraft, similar to the eye of a hurricane, surrounded by a ring of updrafts blowing at near-hurricane force, with multiple small vortices rotating around this ring. The structure found in the Mulhall tornado had been observed for many years in lab experiments and computer models, but it had never before been verified by radar data.Dubbed ROTATE-05, this spring's field work is supported by the National Geographic Society."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_745", "content": "Cape Hatteras has a 10.31 percent chance of experiencing hurricane-force winds this year, followed by Miami Beach at 10.16 percent and Naples at 10.01 percent, based on an analysis of hurricane tracks during the past 154 years and of ocean and climate conditions for 2005.  UCF statistics professor Mark Johnson and Chuck Watson, founder of the Kinetic Analysis Corp. of Savannah, Ga., analyzed 35 cities on the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico coasts. Their findings are available on The probabilities of hurricane force winds, meaning winds of 74 mph or greater, striking other U.S. cities include 9.12 percent for West Palm Beach, Fla., 6.87 percent for New Orleans; 6.66 percent for Wilmington, N.C., and 5.08 percent for Charleston, S.C.  Such odds might seem low and even comforting to residents whose homes were battered by multiple storms last year. However, Johnson and Watson said residents still need to prepare to protect their homes and stock up on food, water and other supplies. Even a 5 percent chance is high.  \"That's a one-in-20 chance that your house will at least experience roof damage and that you could be sitting in the dark for several days,\" Watson said. \"If you buy a lottery ticket every week for a one-in-several-million chance to get rich, doesn't it make sense to prepare for a one-in-20 or even a one-in-a-100 chance of something bad happening?\"  While south Florida cities such as Naples, Fort Lauderdale and West Palm Beach are always at higher risk of storms than north Florida, this year the odds of hurricane-force winds for south Florida are well above the average over the past 154 years, Johnson and Watson concluded. The odds of hurricane-force winds hitting cities in northern Florida and along the Gulf of Mexico coast in Mississippi, Alabama and Louisiana are lower than usual.   The researchers attributed those differences to global atmospheric patterns that control the steering currents, or the upper-level winds that determine the directions that storms follow. This year, the winds should trend more east-to-west, straight across Florida. Last year, the steering currents were directed more toward the north, which led to storm tracks such as Hurricane Charley's hitting Florida's Gulf Coast and then going northeast through the state.  Johnson, an expert in the statistical aspects of hurricane modeling and forecasting, and Watson, whose specialty is geophysics and numerical modeling, have worked together on several hurricane-related research projects during the past 10 years. They have developed maps to support local mitigation strategies for the State of Florida, developed data for Caribbean governments in an effort funded by the Organization of American States and researched hurricane damage models used in the insurance industry for the North Carolina Department of Insurance.   Johnson and Watson also work as consultants to the Florida Commission on Hurricane Loss Projection Methodology, which reviews and accepts public and private hurricane models.   Johnson has taught at the University of Central Florida since 1990. He was chairman of the UCF Statistics Department from 1990 to 1996, and he worked as a visiting scientist at the National Hurricane Center in 1996. Watson has worked in the field of natural hazards modeling since 1989 for a variety of local, state and federal agencies, and has written about remote sensing, distributed computing and natural hazards."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_746", "content": "Even more unusual than the timing of this storm is its path. Typically, hurricanes that form in the Eastern Pacific curve west and weaken over the ocean, or they may move north into Mexico. Adrian is moving east and is expected to make landfall over El Salvador and Guatemala on May 19. Its path is predicted to take it over the same region that was devastated by Hurricane Mitch in 1998. Unlike Adrian, Mitch formed in the Atlantic and crossed this section of Central America from the east. If Adrian survives its encounter with the high mountains of Central America, it could re-emerge in the Caribbean and move over Cuba and the Bahamas. While storms occasionally cross from the Atlantic into the Pacific, it is extremely rare for a storm to move into the Atlantic from the Pacific as Adrian is set to do.Tropical Depression Adrian formed in the afternoon of May 17. By evening, the storm had intensified into a weak tropical storm, and it continued to intensify through the night. It was during this intensification period that the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) captured this image of Adrian on May 18 at 03:22 a.m. local time (09:22 UTC). A dark band of red clouds curves around a nearly closed eye in the center of the image. The red--indicative of high rain rates--shows an area of intense thunderstorms near the core. TRMM research shows that when thunderstorms such as these appear around the core, the likelihood of the storm getting stronger or intensfying goes up. Adrian was in fact intensifying when TRMM captured this image, making this a valuable picture of how a storm is born.The semi-circle of heavy rain also helped researchers identify the center of the storm early in its development. Without TRMM's precipitation radar, the storm would simply be an large blob, with no clearly defined center.The National Hurricane Center predicts that Adrian will continue to intensify, possibly into a weak hurricane, before striking the coast of Central America on May 19. Unusually warm watersb are feeding the storm. Adrian has the potential to unleash heavy rains and floods on the mudslide-prone mountainous coastal region.TRMM is a joint mission between NASA and the Japanese space agency JAXA."}

Smith Professor of Biological Oceanography at Duke's Nicholas School of the Environment and Earth Sciences, will outline additional uses of el Nino forecasting at an 8:30 a.m. Feb. 20 symposium during the American Association for the Advancement of Science's 2005 annual meeting in Washington, D.C.The additional uses he will discuss include managing fisheries, controlling outbreaks of tropical disease and protecting marine mammals and other ocean species.That symposium will be held in the Palladian Room on the lobby level of the Omni Shoreham Hotel.El Nino gets its name from periodic changes in ocean currents that disrupt anchovy fishing off Peru around Christmastime. This worldwide alteration of the normal monsoon cycle changes wind and ocean temperature patterns in ways that lead to flooding in parts of the Americas, droughts in Australia , Southeast Asia and parts of Africa, and a tempering of the North Atlantic hurricane season.Barber was part of an early multidisciplinary research effort called Coastal Upwelling Ecosystems Analysis that in 1971 began using scientific modeling to analyze the biological and physical changes behind what is more properly called the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO).However, it took more than a decade, after 1983, before advances in supercomputing power and satellite technology allowed ENSO forecasting to \"become one of the greatest success stories in American science,\" Barber said in an interview.\"With a small number of sensors we can now forecast what is going to happen with an ENSO nine months in advance with a great degree of certainty,\" he said. \"However, we may not have a good idea about how strong the ENSO is going to be until six months before.\"These forecasts are now used and watched by politicians and bankers and commodity traders and all kinds of other people,\" Barber added. But he contends that the predictive powers of ENSO forecasting are still not being harnessed in three important areas.For one, these reliable early alerts could be used to better manage high yield fisheries that are subject to \"boom and bust\" cycles -- such as those for anchovies, sardines and mackerel, he said.ENSO forecasting could also be used to better control outbreaks of tropical diseases such as mosquito-caused malaria, he added. \"It is possible to give the World Health Organization a nine-month, if not a 12-month, forecast of where excess rains are going to be in the tropics so they can pre-deploy their resources.\"Finally, scientists could use the latest technological tools to assess how ENSO-caused changes in the dynamics of the oceans are likely to relocate nutrient-rich feeding zones where over-exploited or threatened marine mammals, fish and turtles are most apt to congregate.Regulators could then prejudge where existing fishing grounds should be closed, and whether fishermen could be productively directed to alternatives sites, Barber suggested. And naval ships planning sonar exercises could avoid maneuvering in range of vulnerable marine mammals.Barber's talk will be delivered at a symposium entitled \"Biological Perturbations in the Melting World's Oceans: Impacts of Climate Change.\" However he says the periodic alterations of weather patterns during ENSO events actually \"fit in with climate variability, not with climate change.\""}

His detailed wave prediction system is currently in use in the Gulf of Mexico and the Gulf of Maine.Vijay Panchang, head of the Department of Maritime Systems Engineering, doesn't make waves - he predicts what they'll do, when they'll do it and how high they'll get.Using data provided daily from NOAA and his own complex mathematical models, Panchang and research engineer Doncheng Li provide daily wave model predictions for much of the Texas coast, the Gulf of Mexico and the Gulf of Maine. Their simulations, updated every 12 hours, provide a forecast for two days ahead.\"The models we provide are based on very detailed information, such as seabed topography, offshore wave conditions, wind speed and direction and other factors,\" Panchang explains.\"It's useful information for anyone in coastal waters. Texas has a huge coastline, and Maine has more than 3,000 miles of coast. Recreational and fishing boats, cruise ships, commercial ships, and others can use this information. Coastal wave information can also be used to predict sediment transport and for engineering design.\"Because the models use wind data, tsunamis that are created by undersea earthquakes can't be predicted. But that's not to say his modeling system doesn't come up with some big waves.His wave model predicted big waves in November 2003 in the Gulf of Maine, and it was accurate - waves as high as 30 feet were recorded during one storm even in coastal regions.Last summer during Hurricane Ivan, a buoy located 60 miles south of the Alabama coast recorded a whopping 60-foot wave. \"There may have been higher waves because right after recording the 60- foot wave, the buoy snapped and stopped functioning,\" he says.\"Also, the 50-foot wave is an average measure of the sea-state, and the highest waves could be nearly twice as big. Waves during storms can be quite high, and 50-foot waves are not uncommon,\" Panchang reports.He notes that during a storm in 1995 off the Halifax coast, the captain of the Queen Elizabeth II reported a monstrous 95-foot wave.Panchang is also developing a similar wave model prediction system for the Prince William Sound Oil Recovery Institute in the Alaska port of Valdez, site of the Exxon Valdez oil spill. That wave model system should be online by next year.Anyone on the water wants to know how high the waves will be when they out at sea,\" he says. \"We provide a valuable service to those on ships and boats who want to know what the wave conditions will be like in the next 24 hours.\"###Funding for his wave model prediction system is provided by NOAA Sea Grant, The Texas Coastal Management Program, the Prince William Sound Oil Spill Recovery Institute and the National Marine Fisheries Service.For more information, go to"}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_749", "content": "\"The loss of Louisiana's wetlands is the single most catastrophic environmental disaster ever to hit the continental U.S.,\" said Mark Schexnayder, a marine biologist with the Louisiana State University Agricultural Extension and Research Center-Sea Grant Program.  \"The consequences of loosing the wetlands are far reaching and affect everyone.  Of course there are biological and ecological effects, but the biggest cost of losing the wetlands will be on oil and gas prices, causing them to rise everywhere.  The oil production rigs and natural gas pipelines in Louisiana depend on the wetlands to protect their structures from storms and hurricanes.  Without the wetlands, they are exposed.\"  With environmental lessons from Asia's tsunami disaster lingering weeks later and the vigorous 2004 summer of hurricanes, Louisiana's coastal wetlands are one of the most protective barriers against such disasters and account for over 40 percent of the total salt marshlands in the United States. \"Wetlands act as a storm buffer for hurricanes and other large storms,\" said Dr. Denise Reed, a professor of Geology and Geophysics at the University of New Orleans. \"With the rapidly depleting wetlands, people that have lived in southern Louisiana can tell that over the last 30 years, large storms now come in faster and the water rises faster, which gives less time to respond and less time to evacuate. In the next few years, it's going to get worse.\"\"The land is literally gone.  Some people use the term 'the sky is falling,' but here the land is falling,\" Schexnayder said.  \"Everyone saw last summer how hurricane Ivan shot up oil prices after damaging a few oil rigs, and it didn't even have a direct hit.  There's no telling how high the price of oil will go years down the line if a severe hurricane directly hits and there are less wetlands to protect the energy infrastructure and the coastline. Besides losing the oil, you'd also face the price of repairing broken pipelines, huge loses in shrimping and fishing and restructuring the whole shipping industry in New Orleans, one of the largest ports to receive goods in the United States.  It would cost billions and billion of dollars.\"Working at Jean Lafitte National Historic Park, Barataria Preserve and Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium (LUMCON) facilities in Cocodrie and Port Fourchon, LA - expedition scientists are looking at how marsh subsidence (the shrinking down and compacting of soil) along with levee construction, grazing by nutria (large rodents that feed on wetland plants) and other factors all contribute to a rapid loss of wetlands.\"It's a sum total of all these things working together and not any one thing alone,\" said Reed.  \"We know that wetlands survive naturally and have been for thousands of years, but it has only been since the beginning of the 20th century that we have introduced these multiple factors and human factors so that now the natural processes are disrupted.\"\"It's only in the last few years that we have gotten a handle on the rate of subsidence.  We're starting to get a better idea of how this happens and how fast these things happen over time.  The wetlands around New Orleans are so degraded that they provide little or no protection against large storms,\" Reed said.  \"Only a major restoration project can really help bring back those wetlands.\"This research program is part of JASON Expedition (formerly JASON Project), a middle school program designed to engage students in science and math by partnering them with real scientists.  Using satellite broadcasts and Internet technology scientists in the field are linked with classrooms and educational institutions to allow students to interact with the JASON Expedition team in real time and receive a first-hand look at how real wetlands research is collected. Participating JASON schools around the world are playing an active role in the research by using NASA's International Space Station (ISS) Earth KAM camera to identify and to take their own photographs of wetlands from space.  Students have direct access to and control of a digital camera flying on board the International Space Station and can download their wetland images within a few hours after being taken to enhance their understanding of wetlands loss.Students and the general public can see how human activity and natural processes can destroy or build wetlands at \"The expedition engages students in real science, not just textbook theory,\" said explorer Robert Ballard, founder of the JASON Foundation for Education and best known for his discovery of the Titanic.  \"These students are conducting wetland experiments in their own communities, so they can determine the health and vitality of wetlands in their area.\"  \"The most important thing people can do to help save and possibly restore the wetlands is to go out and learn what the problems are.  They are different for all wetlands,\" said Reed.  \"One side of Louisiana doesn't have the same problems as the other side of Louisiana.  We may never get back the wetlands we have lost, but we are working to maintain them and go back to those natural processes.\"\"You don't even have to read a book, just look at a map to see how the wetlands are vanishing,\" Schexnayder said.  \"It will probably take a natural disaster to grab everyone's attention.  It's the old pay now or pay later scenario. But the bottom line is that it's easier to save than rebuild.\"To follow the JASON expedition's exciting research, visit The JASON Foundation for Education, based in Needham, Massachusetts, is a non-profit organization dedicated to providing new ways of teaching and new tools for learning middle-grade science and math through innovative, technology-rich educational and professional development programs."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_750", "content": "In the current issue of the Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences, University of Rhode Island physical oceanographer Dr. Isaac Ginis describes how he and a team of scientists are refining the model by incorporating the factors that favor the formation of large eddies near the sea surface and their effect on wind speed and air humidity. Other members of the team include Alexander P. Khain and Elena Morozovsky of the Institute of Earth Sciences, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel.The authors speculate that large eddies, or circular currents of air, are a pervasive feature in tropical cyclones and suggests that they can contribute significantly to the transfer of energy, heat, and moisture from the ocean to the atmosphere.\"Lack of adequate consideration of the large eddy effects near the surface of the ocean may be one of the reasons for the limited tropical cyclone intensity forecast skill by hurricane prediction models,\" said Ginis. \"The recently implemented to operational Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL)/ University of Rhode Island (URI) coupled hurricane-ocean model helped to improve the intensity predictions measured by the central pressure. However, it has not always translated into improvements in predicting maximum wind speed. This is mainly due to underestimations of the surface winds in strong tropical cyclones.\"In strong wind conditions the GFDL/URI model tends to underpredict surface wind speeds for a given central pressure. It is most likely the result of inadequate representation of the physical processes connected with the storm, in particular the contribution of large eddies in the modeling of the area near the sea surface and how the atmosphere and ocean interact.The main objective in the study was to investigate the mechanisms leading to the formation of large eddies under tropical cyclone conditions and assess their effects on the factors that determine a storm's intensity using a high-resolution, atmospheric computer model.Ginis, Khain, and Morozovsky presented a new method to describe large eddies in both general circulation and regional weather prediction models, including hurricane models. Their approach is called \"superparameterization,\" which consists of an eddy-resolving, two-dimensional system embedded into a weather prediction model, allowing explicit simulations of large eddies.Based on the results of their numerical simulations, the scientists found that when the wind speed is high enough, a strong vertical wind shear that develops near the sea surface triggers conditions that allow for genesis of large eddies. They concluded that a strong background wind, typical for hurricanes, and evaporation from the ocean are the necessary conditions for the formation of large eddies in the lower part of the atmosphere.The experiments demonstrated that as soon as large eddies arise, they affect the transport of heat, moisture, and momentum, modifying the structure of the atmosphere and the way it interacts with the ocean. The most significant manifestation of these effects is a significant increase of the near-surface wind speed, and evaporation from the sea surface, which can double in strong winds.\"These results demonstrate the important role that large eddies play in high wind speed conditions,\" said Ginis. \"Inclusion of these effects in the tropical cyclone models may potentially lead to substantial improvements in the prediction of storm intensity.\"Ginis's work on this project was partially supported by the National Science Foundation.

{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_751", "content": "\"One tropical storm and five hurricanes affecting areas from Florida to the mid-Atlantic states, as well as several outbreaks in four of the last ten days in May contributed to the year's total number of 1,717 tornado reports in the U.S.,\" said Dan McCarthy, NOAA Storm Prediction Center warning coordination meteorologist. This tops the previous record of 1,424 tornadoes in 1998, and the total of 1,368 in 2003.Joe Schaefer, director of the NOAA Storm Prediction Center said, \"Even with the record number of tornadoes, storm related fatalities were limited to 35. This shows that timely watches and warnings combined with our strong partnerships with emergency management and the media to convey that information does save lives.\" The reported number of 35 deaths attributed to tornadoes is significantly below the usual yearly average for these storm-related fatalities.Every year, an average of 1,200 tornadoes kill about 55 Americans, injure 1,500 people and cause more than $400 million in damage. Considered nature's most violent storms, tornadoes can occur any month of the year with peak activity from the months of March through July.\"In 2004, record tornado reports were largely the result of an active hurricane season during August and September. Preliminary numbers indicate a total of 173 tornadoes reported during August,\" McCarthy said. This significantly tops the previous August record of 126 tornadoes set in 1979. Other reports for August include: 120 tornadoes in 1994; 115 in 1992; 112 in 1993; and 108 in 1985.Preliminary data indicate a total of 247 tornadoes reported in September. This significantly tops the previous September record of 139 tornadoes set in 1967, which was mostly attributed to Hurricane Beulah, which produced tornadoes in Texas and parts of Oklahoma. Other years with high tornadic activity for September include: 104 reports in 1998; 101 reports in 1996; and 84 reports in 2001. The average number of tornadoes in the U.S. during September is 47.\"The number of tornadoes associated with tropical storms and hurricanes was extraordinary and can be partially blamed for the high number of overall tornado reports,\" McCarthy said. Tropical Storm Bonnie and five land-falling hurricanesâCharley, Frances, Gaston, Ivan and Jeanneâaffected the mid-Atlantic and Southeast states during August and September. Tornadoes frequently occur in the northeast quadrant of northward advancing tropical systems or their remnants.Hurricane Frances produced the most tornadoes for a tropical system with a preliminarily number of 117 reports. Frances tops Hurricane Beulah, which spawned 115 tornadoes in September 1967. Hurricane Ivan was close with 104 tornado reports, and a total of 16 tornadoes were reported in association with Hurricane Jeanne.\"All in all, the year began slowly and the number of tornadoes was below normal through early May, the heart of tornado season. The weather pattern became more conducive for severe weather activity during the last part of May when 445 tornado were reported,\" said McCarthy.NOAA is dedicated to enhancing economic security and national safety through the prediction and research of weather and climate-related events and providing environmental stewardship of the nationâs coastal and marine resources.

{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_752", "content": "NOAA scientists report that the average temperature for the contiguous United States for 2004 (based on preliminary data) will likely be approximately 53.5 degrees F (11.9 degrees C), which is 0.7 degrees F (0.4 degrees C) above the 1895-2003 mean, and the 24th warmest year on record. Based on data through the end of November, the mean annual temperature in two states (Washington and Oregon) is expected to be much above average, with 30 states being above average, 16 contiguous states near average and no state below the long-term mean.Alaska's annual temperature is expected to be approximately 1.8 degrees F above the 1971-2000 average for 2004, one of the five warmest years for the state, since reliable records began in 1918. Alaska had a record warm summer with a statewide temperature of 4.6 degrees F (2.6 degrees C) above the 1971-2000 mean. May, June, July and August were all record breaking for the state. Much of the West Coast also had record or near record temperatures for the summer of 2004. In contrast, much of the remainder of the contiguous U.S. was relatively cool during June-August, including several cities in the Upper Midwest that had afternoon high temperatures in the low 50s during the middle of August.Spring temperatures across the U.S. were above average in all states, except Florida, which was near normal for the season. Fall was warm across much of the mid-section of the country, but the West remained near average. Winter began relatively warm in November and early December for states from the Upper Midwest to the East Coast.A major feature of the climate in the U.S. in 2004 was the number of landfalling tropical systems. Nine systems affected the U.S. including six hurricanes, three of which were classified as major on the Saffir-Simpson Scale of hurricane intensity. Four of the six hurricanes affected Florida, making it the only state since 1886 to sustain the impact of four hurricanes in one season (Texas also had four hurricanes in 1886). Hurricane Charley in August was the strongest hurricane (category 4 at landfall) to strike the U.S. since Andrew in 1992 and caused an estimated $14 billion in damage. Hurricanes Frances, Ivan and Jeanne quickly followed Charley in September.Hurricane Gaston also impacted the U.S. in August making landfall in South Carolina. In total, the hurricane season cost the U.S. an estimated $42 billion, the most costly season on record. That record has been calculated back to 1900. While there was extensive wind damage in Florida and other coastal locations, flooding was the major impact further inland. Frances impacted the Southeast and southern Appalachians after a wetter-than-average summer, causing millions of dollars in flood damage to the region. Shortly thereafter Ivan traveled a similar path through the mountains and led to widespread flooding, loss of power and landslides.In contrast to the excessive rainfall in the East, much of the West began the year with a long-term rainfall deficit. A four-to-five-year drought in parts of the West intensified during the first half of 2004 as precipitation remained below average. Drier-than-average summer conditions coupled with warmer than normal temperatures in the West exacerbated the drought conditions still further during June-August. Short-term drought relief occurred in the fall as two large storms impacted the West during October. The first major snowfall of the season was associated with these storms for the Sierra Nevada. As of early December, snowpack is above average in Utah, Arizona and Nevada but significantly below average throughout much of the Northwest as well as the eastern slope of the Rockies. Near year's end, moderate to extreme drought continued to affect large parts of the West, including Montana, Idaho, Washington, Oregon, Wyoming, California, Arizona and Colorado.Although the wildfire season got an early start in the western U.S., and record warm temperatures combined with less-than-average precipitation raised fire danger across the West through the summer, the season concluded as below average for the contiguous U.S. However, a record number of acres were burned in Alaska in 2004. Alaska and the adjacent Yukon Territory of Canada saw a rapid increase in fire activity in June, which was sustained through August consuming more than 6.6 million acres in Alaska. In Fairbanks, on 42 of the 92 days of summer, visibility was reduced from smoke associated with the wildfires. This compares to the previous record of 19 days in 1977.The average global temperature anomaly for combined land and ocean surfaces from January-December 2004 (based on preliminary data) is expected to be 0.55 degrees F (0.31 degrees C) above the 1880-2003 long-term mean, making 2004 the 4th warmest year since 1880 (the beginning of reliable instrumental records). Averaged over the year, land surface temperatures were anomalously warm throughout western North America, southern and western Asia and Europe. Boreal fall (September-November) as well as November were warmest on record for combined land and ocean surfaces.Other notable climate events and anomalies across the world in 2004 include an active tropical season in the Northwest Pacific with Japan sustaining ten tropical storm landfalls, exceeding the previous record of six; below normal monsoon rainfall for India, especially in the Northwest part of the country; flooding in Northeastern India from monsoon rains in June-October; a rare hurricane in the South Atlantic in March; and an extensive and severe heat wave in Australia during February.Sea surface temperatures in much of the central and east-central equatorial Pacific increased during the latter half of 2004 as weak El NiÃ±o conditions developed. Though global impacts have been slow to develop, the NOAA Climate Prediction Center expects the current El NiÃ±o to persist through early 2005, bringing drier-than-average conditions to Indonesia, northern Australia and southeastern Africa.The National Climatic Data Center is part of the NOAA Satellites and Information Service, America's primary source of space-based oceanographic, meteorological and climate data.

{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_753", "content": "In the current issue of the Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences, University of Rhode Island physical oceanographers Il-Ju Moon, Isaac Ginis and Tetsu Hara have published two companion papers that investigate the how surface waves and wind affect the dynamics of growing seas and complex seas under extreme hurricane conditions using a combination of computer models. Other collaborators on the project include Stephen Belcher, Department of Meteorology, University of Reading, Berkshire, England, and Hendrik Tolman, the NOAA National Center for Environmental Prediction Environmental Modeling Center, Camp Springs, MD.The team of scientists combined three computer models to ascertain their results. The NOAA WAVEWATCH III ocean surface wave model accounts for wind input, wave-wave interaction and dissipation due to whitecapping, and wave-bottom interaction. The equilibrium spectrum model, created by Hara and Belcher, estimates the effect of the wind on the ocean by taking into account the stress caused by the waves. The wave boundary layer model, also created by Hara and Belcher, explicitly calculates the near-surface wind profile, as well as the surface drag created by the waves. In the first study, the combined model predicted the effect of the wind-wave interaction by calculating how the waves contribute to the dynamics of a mature and growing sea. The second study followed the same approach, but focused on the effect of surface waves on air-sea exchange in extreme complex seas forced by tropical cyclones.The scientists found a new characterization of the effect of surface waves on air-sea momentum under hurricane wind forcing. The size and location of the waves as well as the wind speed and direction and their impact on the other create a variety of conditions that can affect the track and intensity of a hurricane. The research team determined that the coupling of a surface wave model with a hurricane model is necessary for accurate predictions of track and intensity. This finding is significant because the wind-wave interaction is presently ignored by hurricane prediction models.\"There have been impressive strides taken in the quality of hurricane track forecasting over the last 10 years mainly due to improved computer models,\" said Ginis. \"However, there appears to be still limited skill in predicting storm intensity changes. In light of the fundamental role the air-sea interaction processes play in supplying energy to the hurricane, our results seem to be promising for major improvements in hurricane intensity forecasting.\"The combined models used in this project have helped scientists to further understand the interaction of the atmosphere and the ocean by introducing parameters that describe the ocean waves under high wind conditions, including during a tropical cyclone. Additional factors, such as the effect of breaking waves and sea spray, may also play an important role in air-sea interaction and momentum, but the team of scientists predicts that adding parameters will only further confirm their results.###The URI Graduate School of Oceanography is one of the country's largest marine science education programs, and one of the world's foremost marine research institutions.

{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_754", "content": "\"This season has seen a breakthrough in hurricane and oceanographic research,\" said ONR program manager Dr. Carl Friehe. \"Real-time data sent back by the drifters and floats have created great interest among oceanographers, meteorologists, and hurricane forecasters.\" Project CBLAST-Hurricane focuses on the energy exchanges between the ocean and atmosphere during a hurricane, and how those interactions affect a storm's intensity (a separate CBLAST component studies low-wind interactions). By better understanding these energy exchanges, scientists can develop better models to predict a hurricane's development. A hurricane's intensity determines the size of the storm surge of water that precedes it--which can pose a significant threat to ships in port.New instruments that can measure the ocean water's temperature, salt content, and velocity--before, during, and after a hurricane--are providing a unique view of the conditions that affect a storm's intensity. While satellites can provide ocean temperature data, they only monitor the \"skin\" or surface of the ocean down to just 1/8th of an inch. To reach into lower depths, ONR has sponsored the development of new ocean probes by Dr. Eric D'Asaro and Dr. Tom Sanford of the University of Washington Applied Physics Laboratory (Seattle), and Dr. Peter Niiler and Dr. Eric Terrill of Scripps Institution of Oceanography (La Jolla, Ca).The data collected on water conditions over the course of a hurricane are crucial to forecast modeling because \"the ocean is the gasoline for the hurricane's engine,\" explained ONR's Friehe. During the summer and fall, the sun warms the top hundred meters or so of the ocean. Hurricanes only form over these warm ocean regions, where water easily evaporates and is picked up by swirling weather patterns. \"In order to build a model that can predict a storm's development, we need to know exactly how much energy is in the water, as well as how it is distributed by depth and location between Africa and the Caribbean,\" he said.The floats from the UW Applied Physics Lab and Scripps are programmed to bob up and down through the upper 200 meters (656 ft) of the ocean, measuring the water's temperature, salinity, dissolved gases, and velocity. They also monitor underwater sounds as part of a study to develop methods of measuring hurricane force winds and rainfall. The floats from the Applied Physics Lab are deployed in a line perpendicular to a hurricane's path, so that one is centered on the eye, another is about 50 km (27 nautical miles) to the north of the eye, and a third 100 km (54 nm) to the north. Each time the instruments reach the water's surface, they transmit data back to scientists using satellite communications.Drifters from the Scripps team remain on the ocean's surface, floating like bottles with a message that's constantly updated as their instruments measure air pressure, wind speed and direction, and sea surface temperature. They can collect data for as long as their batteries continue to function (up to several months) or they can be picked up by passing ships for reuse and downloading of more detailed information than they are able to transmit. The drifters and floats were dropped into the paths of this season's hurricanes by the U.S. Air Force Reserve 53rd Weather Reconnaissance Squadron (Keesler AFB, Miss.) from two C130J Hercules aircraft. The probes parachuted into the ocean and automatically began taking measurements. They returned time series of ocean profiles that documented the upwelling and mixing caused by the hurricanes. Several of the floats and drift buoys obtained an unprecedented second set of hurricane observations as Hurricane Jeanne followed closely on the path of Frances.While the drifters and floats weathered the storms from sea level and below, other CBLAST instruments--and researchers--flew through Hurricane Jeanne in two National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) WP-3D aircraft. From various altitudes throughout the storms, and with the help of fixed and deployed instruments, they collected data on air temperature and pressure, wind speed and direction, and precipitation. The combination of atmospheric and ocean science, technology (GPS, cell phones, miniature computers, etc.), deployment via aircraft, and the need for better hurricane forecasting have all come together in 2004 to mark a sea change in hurricane research, according to Friehe.NOAA provides project management for CBLAST, as well as researchers, aircraft, flight crews, and other support through its Hurricane Research Division, Aircraft Operations Center, and Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research. Researchers from the University of Miami, Rosenstiel School; University of Washington Applied Physics Lab; Scripps Institution of Oceanography; Massachusetts Institute of Technology; and the University of Massachusetts Microwave Remote Sensing Laboratory also participated. The 5-year (FY01-FY05) funding amount for CBLAST Hurricane is: $5.3 M from ONR and $0.7 M from NOAA's U.S. Weather Research Program (USWRP)."}

Working to model electric power restoration across storm-damaged areas, the scientists have been able to provide detailed information to planners on the exact infrastructure impacts, a feat even more remarkable in that the models were run before the hurricanes made landfall.The computer models were put to the test under fire as Hurricane Jeanne approached the Florida coast in September. Multi-agency teams assembled in the state emergency operations center in Tallahassee and the national emergency operations center in Washington. These command centers coordinated the evacuation and recovery activities as the hurricane approached and then moved through Florida and other southern regions. The models supplied updated predictions to the two centers and to the decision makers responding to the approaching storm.Electric power restoration data became a key focus for FEMA's first-response personnel, the groups that arrive immediately after the storm hits to provide the first emergency services (water, sanitation, communication). The Los Alamos outage maps helped with early identification of the areas needing first deployment and state of services FEMA staff would likely find when they arrived. A second FEMA team, responsible for energy issues and working closely with industry, state and local stakeholders, needed the Los Alamos data to help publicize the electric power conditions returning residents should be expecting, and to assist utility planning to restore electricity to the area.An outgrowth of the event is a potential collaborative effort with Florida Light and Power to help prepare their planners and responders for next year's hurricane season.The Los Alamos computer modeling effort for infrastructure protection has a core team of 40 staffers, and they run their simulations on a range of high-end desktop computers with enhanced graphic-processing capability, including laptops, desktops and cluster systems.Los Alamos has a strong history in the use of computer modeling to examine critical infrastructures and how their interconnected nature can make them vulnerable. From battlefield analysis to storm-impact studies, Los Alamos scientists have built tools that help planners and first responders make the best decisions in hard situations.With the TRANSIMs traffic modeling tools, now commercialized, regional planners were given the ability to virtually explore different patterns of roadways, watching computerized commuters navigate through changing cityscapes.Using EpiSims, scientists have explored such questions as how different smallpox vaccination plans would affect the spread of an outbreak, while Urban Atmospheric Transport models have predicted the spread of chemical and biological agents if released on the streets of a major city.A prototype version of the Interdependent Energy Infrastructure Simulation System (IEISS) was used in preparation for the 2002 Salt Lake City Olympics, and now has matured to allow researchers to identify critical components and vulnerabilities in coupled infrastructure systems to (1) assess how future investments in the systems might affect quality of service; (2) perform integrated cost-benefit studies; (3) evaluate the effects of regulatory policies; and (4) aid in decision-making during crises."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_756", "content": "Benjamin Schwartz, of Doe Hill, Va., Highland County, a Ph.D. student in geosciences in the College of Science, is using an innovative technique to characterize ground water movement in sinkholes. His goal is to recommend management strategies to reduce contamination of aquifers in regions that are rife with sinkholes. Hurricane Ivan's downpour in Southwest Virginia allowed him to measure changes in underground water during a short four-day period.Schwartz will present his findings at the 116th national meeting of the Geological Society of America in Denver on Nov. 7 through 10.Sinkholes generally form over limestone and dolomite. That rock dissolves and the earth on the surface subsides. Water from the sinkhole either seeps into the subsurface or runs in through a fissure or cave opening and rapidly enters the aquifer.\"People up and down the Shenandoah Valley get their water from aquifers,\" Schwartz said. \"Often, these aquifers are contaminated. Sources of contamination include runoff from paved surfaces or because a good portion of Virginia's agricultural land is on karst terrain. There is little filtration between surface water and karst aquifers.\"Karst is a term used for a landscape where water movement is underground because of the voids in the bedrock.Schwartz is using six sinkholes on Virginia Tech's Kentland Farm along the New River in Montgomery County to measure how water and contaminants move within a sinkhole, that is, the hydrology and chemical transport in a sinkhole. He is looking at depth to bedrock (soil thickness), slope within the sinkhole, drainage area, and land use â such as wood land, crop land, or pasture (\"Cattle love to stand in sinkholes.\") to determine if such sinkhole characteristics indicate what is happening underground.He is using a geophysical technique called electrical resistivity. Current is passed through the soil using a car battery attached to two electrodes embedded in the soil. By using an array of 25 embedded electrodes, and by changing the locations of the current electrodes, voltages can then be measured at different electrodes in the array. Nearly 200 measurements are taken using a single array. \"If you know the voltage and current, you can calculate the resistance,\" Schwartz said.Different degrees of electrical resistance allow him to identify water, rock, soil and voids to a depth of about 15 meters and create a model of the subsurface. Schwartz also may be able to determine the water's chemistry by the changes in electrical resistance measured in an aquifer. He explains that sitting or pooled water becomes saturated with minerals while fresh rainwater has a low dissolved mineral content. Fresh water conducts electricity poorly compared to water loaded with minerals.Depressions in the bedrock surface also can store contaminants. When rain and runoff pour water through caverns and fissures, the contaminants are flushed out of the depressions and into the aquifer.Schwartz took advantage of Hurricane Ivan to measure a rapid change in water movement under a sinkhole. \"I went out before the hurricane and ran two transects (measurements from lines of electrodes) as a control. I left the electrodes in place then made four measurements as the storm moved through and afterward.\" He said he only actually got rained on once.The resulting two-dimensional computer model showed the changes in water movement. \"I saw that water was not sinking evenly or being taken up like a sponge, but that there are preferential flow paths.\"Next, he will create a 3-D model by placing the electrodes in a grid, which will allow him to add the direction of water movement to his model. He combines the electrical resistivity measurements with a topographic map of the surface to create a 3-D model of the bedrock and land surfaces. But he won't have to wait for another hurricane. \"If a rain event is predicted, I can take base line measurements then monitor the site. But another 3- to 4-inch rainfall would be nice.\"Soon, to confirm his interpretations from this new use of electrical resistivity, Schwartz will drill a series of wells.Schwartz will present the paper, \"Hydrologic characterization of sinkholes in agricultural settings,\" at 2:15 p.m. Sunday, Nov. 7, in room 205 of the Colorado Convention Center.

They have identified species-specific sounds using 10 hydrophones from the Long-Term Acoustic Recording System (LARS). LARS, custom built at CMS, uses a system of recording devices anchored just off the bottom of the shallow waters of Charlotte Harbor. The hydrophones record underwater sounds for ten seconds every 10 minutes for up to 50 days.âThe loudest low frequency sound from the storm sounds were recorded at 4 p.m. when Charleyâs eye was in the mouth of Charlotte Harbor,â said Locascio, adding they had expected the fish love songs to shut down during the storm. âSound from the hurricane was minimal an hour and a half later, at which time the first fish calls were recorded.âThey recorded the hurricaneâs low frequency noise from zero to 100 hertz (Hz) while the higher pitched fish spawning songs were recorded at 500-600 Hz. Their data, recorded for three nights after the hurricane, showed an increase in fish calling with maximized sound levels and a start time more than two hours earlier than nights prior to the storm.âWe found no immediate negative storm impact on chorusing fish populations,â explained Mann. âIt is possible increased fresh water flow into the harbor from hurricane rains could impair chorusing and spawning.âAmong the recordings were the sand sea troutâs unique call, which typically begins its courtship calls about dusk and ends a few hours later and sounds like a âdouble-pulseâ purring while the fury of Charley sounded like a dull âshhhhhhh.â They used the sounds to generate a visual âspectogramâ of the data.âNightly chorusing events started at about 7:30 p.m. and lasted nearly seven hours,â said Locascio.Mann and Locascio recently presented the data recorded during Hurricane Charley at a conference at the Mote Marine Laboratory in Sarasota."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_758", "content": "Pecan growers in Georgia and Alabama, two of the primary pecan growing areas were already expecting a light production year due to reduced nut set on many cultivars, said Tim Brenneman, APS member and plant pathologist with the University of Georgia. \"But then the hurricanes came late in the growing season and caused tremendous damage to pecan crops in these two states,\" he said.Georgia, which normally produces 120 million pounds of pecans annually, lost an estimated 50 percent of its already reduced pecan crop. Alabama, which took a direct hit from Hurricane Ivan, lost 80 percent of its total crop. Damage to the pecan trees include pecans blown prematurely from the limbs, twisted limbs and limb breakage, as well as severe tree leaning and loss of entire trees. Approximately 15-20 percent of all pecan trees in the state of Alabama were destroyed. \"We aren't yet certain of the full effect the damage has had on the remaining trees,\" said Brenneman. \"There's evidence that some trees may not fully recover,\" he said. Many farmers have tried to save the injured trees by using tractors to pull the trees straight and remove damaged limbs.Pecan trees take many years to get into full production. The stress on damaged trees may affect pecan production for years to come. \"Next year's crop is dependent on the health of the trees when they go into winter,\" said Brenneman.Another problem brought on by the hurricanes is increased pecan disease. One disease that normally doesn't appear, Phytophthora shuck and kernel rot, has appeared in the middle of the Georgia pecan growing area. The disease, caused by a fungus-like organism, occurs when there is an extended period of cool, wet weather much like the weather caused by the hurricanes. The disease causes the kernel to discolor and rot, rendering it inedible. \"The appearance of this disease has really compounded the situation,\" said Brenneman. Plant health specialists are working with growers to control the outbreak of this disease.###The American Phytopathological Society (APS) is a non-profit, professional scientific organization. The research of the organization's 5,000 worldwide members advances the understanding of the science of plant pathology and its application to plant health."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_759", "content": "The models reviewed by Johnson and Watson do not forecast the paths of particular storms. They simulate the damage caused by storms based on storm tracks, which usually are provided by the National Hurricane Center. To develop projections for insurance companiesâ losses, the models consider data such as historical storm tracks, the percentages of concrete, wood-frame and mobile homes in an area and projected wind speeds.The researchers suggested that creating a centralized database of wind speeds during storms and requiring insurance companies to divulge more information about the reports of damage they receive and the claims they pay would help to make the models more accurate. The insurance company models also did not consider some factors, such as soil moisture and the possibility of leftover debris from prior hurricanes, which can dramatically influence how much damage storms inflict.Before Hurricane Andrew struck South Florida in 1992, insurance companies generally relied on analyses of their losses during prior years to set premiums and deductibles. The catastrophic damage caused by Hurricane Andrew prompted insurance companies to base decisions on models that predict wind speed, how winds may be slowed by structures or different terrains and the estimated damage those winds would cause.Many of the models used by companies are private and therefore could not be directly reviewed by Johnson and Watson. However, the publicly available models and data provided by private modelers to a Florida commission showed dramatic differences in estimates of wind speeds and damage, especially for inland areas. âThis range (in the modelsâ results) presents a major problem for regulators, government officials and consumers, as the choice of model could result in premiums differing by several hundred dollars a year for a typical home,â the researchers wrote in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society article.In response to residentsâ concerns about hurricane premiums and deductibles, Florida legislators likely will consider changes to some of the stateâs policies regarding hurricane insurance. Legislators do not set insurance rates, but they can pass laws regulating them. Johnson and Watson do not recommend any specific legislation regarding how states regulate insurance rates. However, they said they can help legislators assess how changes to premium or deductible structures would affect homeowners and insurance companies. âThose tests are essential when youâre dealing with insurance, because youâre experimenting with peopleâs lives and the economic livelihood of insurance companies,â Watson said. The two researchers run a Web site,  Johnson and Watson are consultants to the Florida Commission on Hurricane Loss Projection Methodology, which reviews and accepts public and private hurricane models. The analyses that will be reported in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society were funded by the states of North Carolina and Florida, the Organization of American States and the U.S. Agency for International Development. Data from Florida was used in that study, and the general conclusions are applicable throughout the United States."}

Scientists need to better understand the complex interactions that lead to hurricane intensification and dissipation, and the various physical processes that affect hurricane intensity and rainfall distributions. Because uncertainties in representing hurricane cloud processes still exist, it is vital that model findings be evaluated against actual hurricane observations whenever possible. Two-dimensional maps of cloud heights such as those provided by the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer offer an unprecedented opportunity for comparing simulated cloud fields against actual hurricane observations. The newly released images of Hurricanes Frances and Ivan were acquired Sept. 4 and Sept. 5, 2004, respectively, when Frances' eye sat just off the coast of eastern Florida and Ivan was heading toward the central and western Caribbean. They are available at: The left-hand panel in each image pair is a natural-color view from the instrument's nadir camera. The right-hand panels are computer-generated cloud-top height retrievals produced by comparing the features of images acquired at different view angles. When these images were acquired, clouds within Frances and Ivan had attained altitudes of 15 and 16 kilometers (9.3 and 9.9 miles) above sea level, respectively. The instrument is one of several Earth-observing experiments aboard Terra, launched in December 1999.

{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_761", "content": "âIf Hurricane Ivan comes ashore on west Floridaâs barrier islands as a major hurricane, Category 3 or stronger, most of the coast has the potential to be inundated by storm surge under the south eye wall at landfall,â said Abby Sallenger, a USGS oceanographer. The USGS and NASA recently surveyed these islands using airborne laser mapping, providing for the first time detailed elevation maps of the islandâs âfirst line of defense.â An example of the âfirst line of defenseâ would be a sand dune protecting an ocean front cottage or road. The average Florida west coast âfirst line of defenseâ elevation is about 6 feet -- less than half the 13-foot average of the Florida east coast where Hurricane Frances made landfall a week ago. USGS scientists have prepared maps showing the proportion of the âfirst line of defenseâ that would be inundated by worst-case scenario storm surge associated with Categories 1 through 5 hurricanes. See: The storm-surge elevations (simulated by NOAA) represent the maximum surge that results along the open coast from hurricanes of a given category, approaching from different directions, and at different speeds. On Floridaâs west coast barrier islands, the maximum surge will typically occur to the south of landfall under the eye wall and decreases in elevation with distance away from the eye wall. âWhere the storm surge exceeds the elevation of the dunes, currents will flow across the barrier islands potentially driving massive quantities of sand landward,â Sallenger said. âIn some cases where barrier islands are low and narrow, the currents will carve new inlets like what happened in 2003 on the Outer Banks of North Carolina during Hurricane Isabel and this year on North Captiva Island, Fla., during Hurricane Charley.â The USGS serves the nation by providing reliable scientific information to describe and understand the Earth; minimize loss of life and property from natural disasters; manage water, biological, energy, and mineral resources; and enhance and protect our quality of life."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_762", "content": "In Florida alone, initial estimates for losses caused by Frances were between $2 and 4 billion following the projected $7.4 billion in insured damages from Hurricane Charley, according to Reuters News Service. In most cases, low-rise buildings, including residential, institutional, and commercial structures are the most vulnerable and carry the brunt of the damage and losses from extreme wind. \"Engineers have the ability to theoretically understand and simulate how a storm will impact a structure,\" said Muhammad Hajj, professor of engineering science and mechanics at Virginia Tech. \"This ability, however, needs to be complemented with computational power such as the supercomputing system developed at Virginia Tech to obtain reliable values for wind loads,\" he said. Hajj and his Virginia Tech colleagues, Professors Henry Tieleman and Saab Ragab in Engineering Science and Mechanics, and Finley Charney in Civil and Environmental Engineering, are a part of the Hurricane Loss Reduction Consortium: Wind and Structural Engineering Initiative. The consortium members are Virginia Tech, Clemson University, University of Florida and the Johns Hopkins University. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) funded this consortium. Although the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) maintains minimum building codes, and builders follow these codes \"as a first basis,\" Hajj said, \"there is still a wide fluctuation in the standards used.\" Hajj also notes that complex terrains of mountainous areas (as in the Carolinas, Virginia and some of the Caribbean Islands) create excessive turbulence that may cause increased wind loads.\" In addition to differences in terrain, existing codes do not address how other factors contribute to damage to low-rise buildings. \"As wind impacts a structure, different parameters such as duration of extreme loads, connector types, missing connectors, shoddy workmanship, and below-standard materials will determine the extent of damage,\" Hajj said. He and his colleagues are working on modeling these effects as well. The researchers of the Hurricane Loss Reduction Consortium have instrumented homes along the Florida coast that were subjected to the winds of various storms such as Tropical Storm Isodore and Hurricanes Bonnie, Dennis and Floyd. They have analyzed these results and made preliminary comparisons to wind tunnel results. \"The wind tunnel simulations are indeed capable of reproducing average values of wind loads, but appreciable differences may arise when considering local values,\" the team members from Virginia Tech explained in a progress report to NIST. As the consortium continues its work, its long-term objective is to provide a full computational platform to calculate wind loads and structural capacities of low-rise buildings and to incorporate the findings into regional and national codes. Ultimately, the hope is to appreciably reduce damage and increase safety. At Virginia Tech, the efforts are also a part of the recently established Center of Extreme Load Effects on Structures under Virginia Tech's Institute for Critical Technology and Applied Science initiative."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_763", "content": "As its 235-km-per-hour winds passed the Bahamas, Frances was heading for landfall on the Florida coast some time on Saturday, and three quarters of a million Americans are in the process of evacuating their homes. To wait and watch for Frances might be suicidal for human beings, but space-based observers such as Envisat observe its passage without danger.\"Because of Envisat's multi-sensor capability, we can slice right through the hurricane with just a single satellite,\" explained JosÃ© Achache, ESA Director of Earth Observation Programmes. \"Effectively Frances is taken apart for meteorologists to study. The data returned by Envisat includes cloud structure and height at the top of the hurricane, wind and wave fields at the bottom, sea surface temperature and even sea height anomalies indicative of upper ocean thermal conditions that influence its intensity.\" Important processes occur at a range of altitudes and locations throughout a hurricane - basically a large powerful storm centred around a zone of extreme low pressure.  Strong low-level surface winds and bands of intense precipitation combine with strong updrafts and outflows of moist air at higher altitudes, with energy released as rainy thunderstorms. Until now, the only reliable source of such high-resolution measurements at different altitudes was from aircraft flown directly through the hurricane. Envisat carries both optical and radar instruments, enabling researchers to observe high-atmosphere cloud structure and pressure in the visible and infrared spectrum, while at around the same time using radar backscatter to measure roughness of the sea surface and so derive the wind fields just over it. Those winds converging on the low-pressure eye of the storm are what ultimately determine the spiralling cloud patterns that are characteristic of a hurricane.  Florida-based scientists have begun to take advantage of this unique single-spacecraft combination of instruments â the Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) and Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ASAR) â as hurricane season gets into full swing. The University of Miami's Centre for Southeastern Tropical Advanced Remote Sensing (CSTARS) ground station has an agreement to acquire ASAR and MERIS data direct from Envisat, with ERS-2 wind scatterometer data set to follow in the near future. Their access to Envisat data has come just as the second hurricane in less than a month is heading towards the Florida coast. \"With MERIS and ASAR, Envisat can image both the ocean and atmosphere pretty much simultaneously, which is a very useful capability during hurricane season,\" said Hans Graber, Professor of Applied Marine Physics at the University of Miami and Co-Director of CSTARS. While MERIS returns detail on the swirling clouds at the top of the hurricane, ASAR pierces right through the clouds to show the wind-wracked face of the sea beneath the storm.  \"Specifically in terms of Frances, the eye of the hurricane seems to be rolling a lot right now from the top of the clouds, looking quite unstable, the information from an ASAR image should help localise its size and position on the ocean,\" Graber said. \"And wind fields around the eye wall can be derived from ASAR data â right now all we have to go on are measurements from the hurricane hunter planes that fly right through the storm.\" Simultaneous MERIS and ASAR acquisitions are planned for Friday by CSTARS, even as the storm comes closer to predicted landfall the following morning. \"Our current activity is along the lines of a shakedown â we're investigating how this can be used,\" added Graber. \"Our final goal is to get this working on an operational basis during hurricane season. We have a deal to use radar data from the Canadian Space Agency, and also have access to other satellite resources for high temporal coverage of the affected region. \"The potential is there to extract a large amount of useful information which can help the US National Hurricane Center increase the accuracy of their hurricane predictions and reduce danger to the public.\"  Another instrument aboard Envisat is being used to take the temperature of Frances, both down at the surface of the ocean and at the heights of its towering clouds. Water temperatures are the main underlying energy reservoir powering Frances; together with the correct atmospheric conditions, they need to exceed 26ÂºC in order to form and maintain a tropical cyclone. Envisat's Advanced Along Track Scanning Radiometer (AATSR) works like a space-based thermometer, acquiring the temperature of the sea surface down to a fraction of a degree.  Meanwhile AATSR also returns useful atmospheric data, measuring the temperature of the top of hurricane clouds â the higher into the atmosphere they extend, the colder they are - and also deriving their ice content. \"We produced a combined AATSR sea surface temperature and cloud top temperature image, which shows the sea surface temperature to be as high as 29ÂºC in the area,\" remarked Carsten Brockmann of Brockmann Consult, a German company processing both MERIS and AATSR hurricane imagery. \"This two-sensor combination gives meteorologists a lot of information to help them understand the dynamics of the hurricane and better predict its development.\" AATSR information can be correlated with MERIS data cloud height and development to gain a good estimate of the hurricane's precipitation potential, and improve understanding of how this relates to its overall intensity. Condensation of water vapour releases latent heat, which warms the vicinity of the hurricane eye. This in turn evaporates more surface water and feeds the heat engine powering the hurricane.   The thermal energy of warm water, which partly powers a hurricane, is known as tropical cyclone heat potential (TCHP). Oceanic features, such as warm core rings, eddies, and the Gulf Stream, represent a source of enhanced heat fluxes to the atmosphere that may cause the strengthening of tropical cyclones, such as hurricanes. Warm waters may extend to at least 100 meters beneath the surface in many of these oceanic features, representing waters of very high heat content. Several hurricanes have intensified when their tracks pass over eddies or other masses of warm water with high TCHP values. For example, in 1995 Hurricane Opal suddenly intensified in the Gulf of Mexico after passing over a warm ring with TCHP values of up to six times the threshold to sustain a tropical cyclone. Previously, researchers used sea surface temperature alone to estimate the role of the upper ocean thermal conditions on hurricane intensification. The problem with this is that the sea surface temperature measured by AATSR or comparable satellite instruments may not by themselves show these warm upper ocean features, particularly during summer months in tropical regions.  In the past these upper ocean features have gone unseen by satellite-based temperature sensors because they are effectively camouflaged beneath a very shallow and stable layer of warmer water. Tropical cyclone wind forces easily erode this thin upper layer by mixing the upper waters to depths that may go down to 100 meters, giving the tropical cyclones the potential to absorb ocean thermal energy, if conditions are appropriate. Now, estimates of TCHP based on satellite observations of sea surface temperature and sea surface height can detect these features. Researcher Gustavo Goni, Joaquin Trinanes and Peter Black of the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory (NOAA/AOML) are working on this original methodology to detect these warm water masses and to compute their tropical cyclone heat potential values using several satellite sensors including one on Envisat. \"These water features are critical for identifying regions of high TCHP values that may potentially contribute to the intensification of a hurricaneâ, Goni explained. \"These regions of high TCHP values provide the hurricanes with the opportunity to absorb much more thermal energy if overall conditions are right. My research is taking advantage of the fact that these warm water masses cause an upward elevation in ocean height of up to 30 cm. Such sea height anomalies can then be mapped with space-based radar altimeter data.\" Radar altimeters, such as the Radar Altimeter-2 instrument on Envisat, fire hundreds of radar pulses down to Earth every second, and by timing their return down the nanosecond can measure sea height to a maximum accuracy of two centimetres from hundreds of kilometres above the Earth. The US Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) combines Envisat RA-2 data with data from similar radar altimeters aboard the Jason-1 and GFO satellites to enhance overall accuracy and spatial and temporal coverage, forming the source for altimetry products which, in turn, form the basis for NOAA/AOML-produced maps of tropical cyclone heat potential depicting the upper ocean thermal conditions, shown here overlaid against Hurricane Frances' track so far. \" At this time I use this product only for research purposes, providing an enhanced understanding of the life of a hurricane. However, analogous products are being produced and used operationally for forecasting by the National Hurricane Center\", Goni concluded. Altimetry-based wind speed and wave height products are also distributed by the French firm Collecte Localisation Satellites (CLS), and can reveal sea surface features related to the presence of hurricanes.   Launched in March 2002, ESA's Envisat satellite is an extremely powerful means of monitoring the state of our world and the impact of human activities upon it. Envisat carries ten sophisticated instruments to observe and monitor the Earth's atmosphere, land, oceans and ice caps, maintaining continuity with the Agency's ERS missions started in 1991. After two and a half years in orbit, more than 700 scientists from 50 countries are about to meet at a special symposium in Salzburg in Austria to review and discuss early results from the satellites, and present their own research activities based on Envisat data. Starting on Monday, the Envisat Symposium will address almost all fields of Earth science, including atmospheric chemistry, coastal studies, radar and interferometry, winds and waves, vegetation and agriculture, landslides, natural risks, air pollution, ocean colour, oil spills and ice. There are over 650 papers being presented at the Symposium, selected by peer review. Presentations will include results on the Prestige oil spill, last year's forest fires in Portugal, the Elbe flooding in 2002, the evolution of the Antarctic ozone hole, the Bam earthquake and pollution in Europe. Numerous demonstrations are planned during the week in the ESA Exhibit area. An industrial consortium exhibit on the joint ESA-European Commission Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) initiative is also planned."}

The results were published in the July issue of the journal Monthly Weather Review.The results are already being used in a model developed at the Hurricane Research Division to estimate rainfall accumulation related to tropical cyclones. The findings are important because they may help in the development of better forecasts.The TRMM satellite offers the best measurements of how and where rain falls around tropical cyclones. This is because its orbit is low to the Earth, allowing more detailed information on storms, and it was designed to cover the tropics.Tropical cyclones consist of winds rotating around low-pressure centers in the tropics that can develop into everything from tropical storms to Category 5 hurricanes.From 1998 through 2000, TRMM observed 260 tropical cyclones in six major ocean basins. Researchers found that the rainfall intensity and where the heaviest rains fell varied depending on a storm's wind speeds, its location and the environment of each basin.Scientists looked at three types of tropical cyclones, based on a standard system for classifying these storms. Tropical storms have wind speeds of less than 73 miles per hour (mph). Category 1 and 2 hurricanes blow with winds of 74 to 110 mph, and Category 3 to 5 hurricanes' winds range above 110 mph.\"This study is important because we know very little about the rainfall distribution in tropical cyclones,\" said lead author of the study, Manuel Lonfat, a University of Miami researcher. \"It revolutionizes our understanding of the distribution of rain in tropical cyclones,\" he added. Lonfat is a NASA Earth System Science Fellowship recipient.\"More than 50 percent of deaths in the U.S. from tropical cyclones over the last 30 years are related to freshwater flooding. So this is currently a very large problem for the forecasting community,\" Lonfat said.When all storms were averaged together the most intense rainfall occurred within 50 kilometers (about 31 miles) of a storm's center, with evidence of very large rain rates as far as 300 to 400 kilometers (about 186 to 250 miles) from the center.When all storms were averaged and analyzed basin by basin, storms in the North Indian basin were the wettest, and East-central Pacific storms were the driest. The Atlantic and West Pacific storms showed similar rain rates: this at first surprised the researchers since Western Pacific storms tend to be bigger and were presumed to be wetter. Researchers also found that the storms were not symmetric, meaning that rain fell at different rates in different areas of a storm. If a round storm were divided into four equal parts through the center, called quadrants, in general it was found that the heaviest rainfall occurred in one of the front quadrants. However, the heaviest rainfall shifted from the front-left to the front-right quadrant as a tropical cyclone's intensity increased. Tropical storms were less symmetric, while stronger hurricanes had a more symmetric inner core. In the Southern Hemisphere, the heaviest rain occurred to the front-left of the storm's path, while in the Northern Hemisphere the heaviest rainfall peaked in the front-right quadrant.Normally, the only way to accurately measure rain falling from a hurricane is when it gets close enough to the coast to be picked up by National Weather Service radars, or by rain gages. Since TRMM is space-based, researchers can assess the rainfall over vast tracts of ocean, where these storms spend most of their lives."}

In addition, TRMM data has aided NOAA, other government agencies, and other users in their operational work of monitoring and predicting rainfall and storms, as well as in storm research. Launched in 1997, TRMM was originally designed as a three-year research mission. Following four years of extending TRMM, NASA and JAXA recently announced a decision to decommission TRMM, and proceed with a safe, controlled deorbit. Options for safe re-entry become increasingly limited the longer TRMM is operated, as it is already more than 3 years beyond design life. \"NASA is committed to working with our partner agencies to help them carry out their mission. We have decided to extend TRMM through this year's hurricane season in our effort to aid NOAA in capturing another full season of storm data,\" said Dr. Ghassem Asrar, Deputy Associate Administrator of NASA's Science Mission Directorate. \"The United States is a leader in Earth remote sensing, and NASA is proud of our role in building that leadership. Our work in partnership with NOAA and international partners such as JAXA is an important part of the world's scientific research on global precipitation and weather. TRMM has been a valuable part of that legacy and we look to our follow-on missions to continue to reap great public benefit,\" he added.TRMM is the first satellite to measure rainfall over the global tropics, allowing scientists to study the transfer of water and energy among the global atmosphere and ocean surface that form the faster portions of the Earth's climate system. Because TRMM's radar enables it to \"see through\" clouds, it allows weather researchers to make the equivalent of a CAT-scan of hurricanes and helps weather forecasters to use TRMM data to improve prediction of severe storms. \"TRMM has proven helpful in complementing the other satellite data used by NOAA's National Weather Service in its operations,\" said Retired Air Force Brig. Gen. David L. Johnson, Director of NOAA's National Weather Service.JAXA welcomes and supports the decision to extend TRMM. The extension will be of benefit to the worldwide science and research communities. NASA and JAXA look forward to continuing their close collaboration beyond TRMM through establishment of a new advanced capability for the measurement of precipitation globally with the Global Precipitation Measurement Mission (GPM). GPM will use an extensive ground validation network to further improve the accuracy of its measurements compared to those made by TRMM.NASA and NOAA have asked the National Academy of Sciences to convene a workshop next month to advise NASA and NOAA on the best use of TRMM's remaining spacecraft life; the overall risks and benefits of the TRMM mission extension options; the advisability of transfer of operational responsibility for TRMM to NOAA; any requirement for a follow-on operational satellite to provide comparable TRMM data; and optimal use of GPM, a follow-on research spacecraft to TRMM, planned for launch by the end of the decade. \"It's important to note that we are able to extend TRMM for this brief period and are vigilant in maintaining our requirement for a safe, controlled re-entry and deorbit of the spacecraft,\" said Asrar. \"We also welcome the opportunity to receive advice from the National Academy of Sciences next month on the best use of TRMM's remaining spacecraft life, TRMM re-entry risk, and the best use of our upcoming next-generation research spacecraft, GPM,\" he addedNASA and NOAA will work with the National Academy of Sciences to share with the public outcomes from next month's workshop.For more information about TRMM on the Internet, visit:"}

The unique TRMM precipitation observations have led to new knowledge concerning the Earth's hydrological cycle and its variation,\" said NASA's Associate Administrator for Earth Science Dr. Ghassem Asrar. \"We now look forward to continued cooperation with our Japanese partners on the Global Precipitation Measurement mission, that will build on the TRMM legacy,\" he added.TRMM is the first mission dedicated to measuring tropical and subtropical rainfall through microwave and visible infrared sensors, including the first spaceborne rain radar. The Precipitation Radar aboard TRMM is the first rain radar ever to be launched into space. It measures precipitation distributions over both land and sea. TRMM has exceeded expectations for accuracy and resolution and has given unprecedented insights into rainfall producing cloud systems over tropical land masses and oceans.In 1998 TRMM observed Hurricane Bonnie and captured for the first time \"sky scrapper\" storm clouds towering some 59,000 feet above the ocean - an event scientists believe may have represented a precursor to storm intensification.In August 2001, TRMM was boosted from an altitude of 350 km to a higher 402 km orbit to extend its life. This maneuver successfully reduced atmospheric drag on the spacecraft during a period of high solar activity and increased TRMM's life by two years while maintaining the high quality of its scientific observations. NASA also developed a technique to extend TRMM's life by using atmospheric drag, rather than fuel, to lower the spacecraft's altitude in the early stages of the controlled de-orbit process. This scenario has permitted TRMM to continue its normal operations since November 2003.NASA and the Japanese Space Program (JAXA) will continue close collaboration by establishing a new advanced capability for the measurement of precipitation globally with the Global Precipitation Measurement mission (GPM). The partnership will launch GPM's Core Satellite by the end of the decade. This complex and pioneering international satellite constellation is a prototype for the comprehensive, coordinated, and sustained Earth observation system envisioned by the international Group on Earth Observations (GEO) framework. The GPM main satellite is planned to carry advanced, dual-frequency radar that will exceed the capabilities of TRMM's radar. This radar will be capable of making measurements of light rain and frozen precipitation present in higher latitudes in addition to the heavier rain present in the tropics.In addition, GPM will comprise an international constellation of satellites to measure precipitation globally approximately every three hours; TRMM is limited to conducting less frequent observations at tropical latitudes. GPM will use an extensive ground validation network to further improve the accuracy of its measurements compared to those made by TRMM. For more information about GPM on the Internet, visit:"}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_767", "content": "Three Louisiana State University researchers have examined more than 100 years of data on hurricane strikes from the coast of Texas to New England and they've found that, historically, the \"hottest\" region for hits is South Florida, followed by North Carolina and the Northern Gulf Coast, from East Texas to the Florida panhandle. Early results from their research also reveal certain trends, such as a major decline in activity for the South Florida coast and a marked increase in activity for North Carolina, particularly in the Cape Hatteras region. LSU Assistant Professor of Geography and Anthropology Barry Keim, LSU Professor Emeritus Bob Muller and James P. Morgan Distinguished Professor Greg Stone, examined 45 points along the Gulf and East Coasts, from South Padre Island, Texas, to Eastport, Maine. Keim said that storm frequency in the region has been the subject of previous research, but there has been no large-scale examination of hurricane strike trends and how they vary geographically. \"Data for the Northern Gulf Coast showed high frequencies, but no trends whatsoever,\" said Keim. \"However, of the two 'hot spots' on the East Coast, South Florida has seen a dramatic decline in activity, while North Carolina has seen a dramatic increase since 1900.\" Keim explained that, despite major strikes like Hurricane Andrew, the last 50 years have been relatively benign to the South Florida coast, with fewer major storms hitting the area directly. Despite the trend, Keim said things could easily change and South Florida could once again become the primary \"hot spot\" for strikes. \"When you look at the frequency of tropical storms and hurricanes, Louisiana ranks right up there with Key West, Fla., Ð each having 36 hits between 1900 and 2000,\" said Muller. According to Stone, director of LSU's Coastal Studies Institute, this is particularly problematic for Louisiana, given the rapid coastal land loss that the state is experiencing, and the increased vulnerability of the coast to storm surge and storm wave damage. \"These data show a definite clustering of storms around certain parts of the country that could have very important societal implications,\" said Stone. \"For example, despite no long-term trend in Northern Florida, frequencies have been high since 1994, which has resulted in dramatic beach erosion and the subsequent need for widespread beach nourishment. Such projects have cost taxpayers tens of millions of dollars.\" The researchers plan to finalize their data and issue a complete report on it in the coming months."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_768", "content": "Dr. Steven Babin, a researcher at the Johns Hopkins University in Applied Physics Lab in Laurel, Maryland studied 13 North Atlantic hurricanes between 1998 and 2001. Ocean color data from the SeaWiFS instrument on the SeaStar satellite were used to analyze levels of chlorophyll, the green pigment in plants. The satellite images showed tiny microscopic ocean plants, called phytoplankton, bloomed following the storms. \"Some parts of the ocean are like deserts, because there isn't enough food for many plants to grow. A hurricane's high winds stir up the ocean waters and help bring nutrients and phytoplankton to the surface, where they get more sunlight, allowing the plants to bloom,\" Babin said. Previous research has relied largely on sporadic, incomplete data from ships to understand how and when near-surface phytoplankton bloom. \"This effect of hurricanes in ocean deserts has not been seen before. We believe it is the first documented satellite observation of this phenomenon in the wake of hurricanes,\" Babin noted. \"Because 1998 was the first complete Atlantic hurricane season observed by this instrument, we first noticed this effect in late 1998 after looking at hurricane Bonnie,\" Babin said. The study found the physical make-up of a storm, including its size, strength and forward speed, is directly related to the amount of phytoplankton that blooms. Bigger storms appear to cause larger phytoplankton blooms. An increased amount of phytoplankton should have more chlorophyll, which satellite sensors can see. Hurricane-induced upwelling, the rising of cooler nutrient-rich water to the ocean surface, is also critical in phytoplankton growth. For two to three weeks following almost every storm, the satellite data showed phytoplankton growth. Babin and his colleagues believe it was stimulated by the addition of nutrients brought up to the surface. Whenever the quantity of plants increases or decreases, it affects the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. As phytoplankton grow, they absorb carbon dioxide, a heat-trapping greenhouse gas. The gas is carried to the ocean floor as a carbon form when the tiny plants die. This enables atmospheric carbon to get into the deep ocean. It is one of several natural processes that contribute to Earth's carbon cycle. By stimulating these phytoplankton blooms, hurricanes can affect the ecology of the upper ocean. Phytoplankton is at the bottom of the food chain. The factors that influence their growth also directly affect the animals and organisms that feed on them. In addition, since climate-related phenomena like El NiÃÂ±o may change the frequency and intensity of hurricanes, storm-induced biological activity may have even greater contributions to future climate change. Scientists are still trying to determine how much carbon dioxide might be removed from such a process. \"Better knowledge of the carbon cycle will improve our understanding of global ecology and how climate change might affect us,\" Babin said.

{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_769", "content": "Those are the findings of a team of North Carolina State University scientists and collaborators from various North Carolina universities and government agencies. Dr. JoAnn Burkholder, NC State professor of botany and director of the Center for Applied Aquatic Ecology, says the research shows that water quality, numbers and health of most of the area's shellfish and finfish, and the overall health of the surveyed water systems â though initially acutely affected by storms, especially Hurricane Fran in 1996 â have over the long run returned to normal, suggesting the resilience of estuarine systems such as the Neuse and Pamlico Sound. Some harmful organisms that took hold before the storms are now in abeyance, suggesting the storms beneficially flushed the areas studied. The one major estuary dweller that has been slow to recover is the blue crab, the researchers say, although its numbers are now creeping back toward average abundances. The research is published online this week (June 14) in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (U.S.A.). After the storms, predictions abounded that Pamlico Sound, of the Albemarle-Pamlico Estuarine System â the largest lagoonal estuary in the United States â would be devastated by the cumulative effects of Hurricane Fran in 1996 and Hurricanes Dennis, Floyd and Irene in 1999. But the longer-term data presented in this study show the remarkable recovery and resilience of the water quality and the finfish and shellfish inhabitants. The paper shows that although less water volume was delivered by Hurricane Fran, large amounts of fish kills were reported due to oxygen depletion and high concentrations of contaminants like nitrogen, phosphorus and fecal bacteria. After the 1999 hurricane season, however, contaminant loads were about the same as in 1996, but no major fish kills were reported due to the enormous amount of flooding that diluted the pollution, Burkholder says. Diminished levels of dissolved oxygen were documented after both storms. But those levels returned to normal shortly after the storms, the research shows. Burkholder added that the storms displaced undesirable organisms â like the toxic alga Pfiesteria, linked to massive fish kills in the 1990s â to areas of the estuary that are less conducive for growth. Pfiesteria populations have shown minimal recovery. The paper also states that commercial catch numbers of shrimp or bivalve molluscs such as clams and scallops did not suffer long-term effects from the storms. The one species affected negatively for a longer period of time by the storms was the blue crab, the paper asserts. Reductions in the number of blue crabs can be attributed, says Dr. David Eggleston, professor of marine science at NC State and co-author of the paper, to the relationship between hurricane floodwaters, the crabs' migration response to the floodwaters and the subsequent overfishing of the mass-migrating crabs. \"We feel the historically low abundances of blue crabs in 2000 and 2001 are a direct result of the interactions between floodwaters and overfishing,\" Eggleston said. \"The blue crabs migrated en masse, which concentrated them and made them more vulnerable to fishing.\" Another piece of the puzzle involved the areas where the blue crabs colonize, Eggleston says. Floodwaters from the rivers impeded the movement of post-larval stages of the blue crab from seawater inlets to their nursery habitats along the western shore of Pamlico Sound. Eggleston says, though, that his new stock assessments of the blue crabs will shed further light on its status in Pamlico Sound. \"The overall story we see is of estuarine resilience to impacts from these types of major storms,\" Burkholder said. \"The negative predictions about long-term devastation of water quality and fisheries, made right after the storms, were not borne out.\" Funding for the study was provided by the Environmental Protection Agency, the N.C. General Assembly, the National Science Foundation and N.C. Sea Grant.

Department of Environment and Natural Resources Division of Water Quality Published: The week of Monday, June 14, 2004, in the online version of Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (U.S.A.) Abstract: Ecosystem-level impacts of two hurricane seasons were compared several years after the storms in the largest lagoonal estuary in the United States, the Albemarle-Pamlico Estuarine System. A segmented linear regression flow model was developed to compare mass-water transport and nutrient loadings to a major artery, the Neuse River Estuary, and to estimate mean annual versus storm-related volume delivery to the Neuse River Estuary and Pamlico Sound. Significantly less water volume was delivered by Hurricane Fran (1996), but massive fish kills occurred in association with severe dissolved oxygen deficits and high containment loadings (total inorganic nitrogen, total phosphorus, suspended solids, fecal bacteria). The high water volume of the second hurricane season (Hurricanes Dennis, Floyd, Irene in 1999) delivered generally comparable but more dilute contaminant loads, and no major fish kills were reported. There were no discernable long-term adverse impacts on water quality. Populations of undesirable organisms such as toxic dinoflagellates were displaced down-estuary to habitats less conducive for growth. The response of fisheries was species-dependent: There was no apparent impact of the hurricanes on commercial landings of bivalve molluscs or shrimp. In contrast, interacting effects of hurricane floodwaters in 1999 and intensive fishing pressure led to striking reductions in blue crabs. Overall, the data support the premise that in shallow estuaries frequently disturbed by hurricanes, there can be rapid recovery in water quality and biota, and benefit from the scouring activity of these storms."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_770", "content": "Owen Kelley and John Stout of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Md., and George Mason University will present their findings at the American Meteorological Society annual meeting in Seattle on Monday, January 12. Kelley and Stout define a \"hot tower\" as a rain cloud that reaches at least to the top of the troposphere, the lowest layer of the atmosphere. It extends approximately nine miles (14.5 km) high in the tropics. These towers are called \"hot\" because they rise to such altitude due to the large amount of latent heat.Water vapor releases this latent heat as it condenses into liquid. A particularly tall hot tower rose above Hurricane Bonnie in August 1998, as the storm intensified a few days before striking North Carolina. Bonnie caused more than $1 billion damage and three deaths, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration National Hurricane Center. Kelley said, \"The motivation for this new research is that it is not enough to predict the birth of a tropical cyclone. We also want to improve our ability to predict the intensity of the storm and the damage it would cause if it struck the coast.\" The pioneering work of Joanne Simpson, Jeffrey Halverson and others has already shown hot towers increase the chance a new tropical cyclone will form. Future work may use this association to improve forecasts of a cyclone's destructive potential. To achieve their goal, Kelley and Stout needed to compile a special kind of global statistics on the occurrence of hot towers inside tropical cyclones. The only possible data source was TRMM satellite, a joint effort of NASA and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency. \"Many satellites can see the top of a hot tower, but what's special about this satellite's Precipitation Radar is that it gives you 'X-ray vision' so you can see inside a hot tower,\" Kelley said. To compile global statistics, the radar needs to be orbiting the Earth. After compiling the statistics, Kelley and Stout found a tropical cyclone with a hot tower in its eyewall was twice as likely to intensify within the next six hours than a cyclone that lacked a tower. The \"eyewall\" is the ring of clouds around a cyclone's central eye. Kelley and Stout considered many alternative definitions for hot towers before concluding the nine-mile height threshold was statistically significant. ###Funding for the research was provided by NASA's Earth Science Enterprise.

{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_771", "content": "Preliminary data from NOAA's National Hurricane Center show that the average track error in NHC's 2003 Atlantic forecasts has been the smallest on record. Some of this year's hurricanes, such as Isabel, followed relatively smooth paths that made track forecasts easier. Others, such as Kate and Nicholas, evolved far more erratically. Such variation in storm behavior from year to year is one of several factors that influence forecast quality. However, \"the past four years have seen a consistent improvement in our forecast tracks,\" says NHC deputy director Edward Rappaport. The boost in hurricane track accuracy follows a more steady improvement since the 1960s of 1â2% a year. Since 2000, the NHC forecasts have benefited from major USWRP-supported improvements in the global computer forecast model developed at NOAA's Environmental Modeling Center (EMC), a part of NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP). The 48-hour forecasts from NCEP's global model now predict the tracks of Atlantic tropical cyclones about 35% more accurately than they did prior to 2000, Rappaport says. \"Improvements to our forecasts are directly linked to advances in the numerical models,\" says Rappaport. \"The models drive the process of making better forecasts. The sustained improvement in performance by the NCEP global model provides confidence to the hurricane forecasters charged with making the official forecast.\" In the late 1990s, USWRP-supported scientists at EMC upgraded the NCEP model to include a better depiction of the hurricane core circulation, a more detailed description of the hurricane's larger-scale environment through advanced use of satellite data, and improved model physics. Other changes to the NCEP model allow it to more accurately incorporate data from dropsondes, the parachute-borne instrument packages designed at NCAR and deployed by NOAA's high-altitude Gulfstream IV aircraft. Introduced in the mid-1990s, these enhanced dropsondes yield far greater detail on winds in and near hurricanes, including high-altitude steering currents. The dropsonde development was funded by the National Science Foundation (NCAR's primary sponsor), NOAA, and the German Aerospace Center. \"These improvements helped lead to an outstanding track forecast of Hurricane Michelle in 2001,\" says Naomi Surgi, leader of EMC's advanced hurricane modeling project. While most other forecast models showed that Michelle would strike Florida, the NCEP global model correctly predicted the storm would curve northeast, away from the state. Based on this guidance, unnecessary evacuations were avoided. Despite their progress in track prediction, forecasters have made comparatively little headway in predicting how strong a hurricane will become and how much rain it will produce. Inland rainfall is now one of the main hurricane-related threats to life and limb. For example, more people died from inland flooding related to Tropical Storm Allison in 2001 than died directly from the far more intense Hurricane Andrew in 1992. \"The intensity problem and the rainfall problem are now the most significant challenges we face over the next decade,\" says Surgi. \"This is what USWRP will be focusing on.\" USWRP support is also assisting in the development of the multi-agency Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, to be used by NOAA for public forecasts starting in late 2004. WRF is the successor to a long line of research models developed at NCAR, including the widely used MM5, the latest version of the NCAR/Penn State mesoscale (thunderstorm-scale) model. MM5 has been a mainstay of the research community and has been used in forecasting operations in a number of countries. \"WRF will serve both the research and operational communities by providing a direct link between the two,\" says USWRP chief scientist Robert Gall, who also heads NCAR's meteorology division. \"In this way, new forecasting technologies developed by researchers can move quickly into day-to-day forecasting operations.\" A research-oriented version of WRF, with a resolution as fine as 2.5 miles (4 kilometers), tracked Hurricane Isabel at NCAR this autumn. NCEP is developing a special version of WRF tailored for hurricanes. Called HWRF, it will include air, sea, and land coupling; a nested wave model; and analysis techniques that use airborne data to provide a better initial description of the three-dimensional circulation within the hurricane's core. \"In combination with these advances, we expect that HWRF's high resolution and state-of-the-art physics will help improve the skill of hurricane intensity and rainfall outlooks,\" says Surgi. The HWRF is expected to replace the current operational high-resolution hurricane model at NCEP in 2006.###USWRP sponsors include NOAA, NASA, NSF, and the U.S. Department of Defense."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_772", "content": "During the early hours of Hurricane Isabel, key Maryland Emergency Management officials had access to Earth Alert, a system that enabled MEMA to quickly view personnel deployment and status on a map, track personnel movement, send text alerts as well as send messages to and from devices in the field. They were also able to report damages and coordinate response teams operating in the field. All these capabilities enabled MEMA to more efficiently provide relief to those in need. MEMA is the state agency within the State of Maryland charged with the responsibility of reducing loss of life and property and protecting Maryland's institutions from natural and man-made disasters. The agency accomplishes this by coordinating the use of state resources during emergencies and disasters. During a one-year pilot program, MEMA officials are testing the Earth Alert Emergency Management System, which was developed by 3e Technologies International (3eTI), Rockville, Md., and funded by NASA Goddard Space Flight Center's Technology Commercialization Office. As described by 3eTI, the Earth Alert System is a multi-faceted solution for Emergency Management Agencies/Organizations and First Responder communities. This new system is another success story in NASA's Technology Transfer Program, whose major goal is to transfer technology derived from its space activities to the public and private sectors for the benefit of humankind. The development of the Earth Alert System is based on NASA Goddard's communications and information systems technologies. \"We have worked closely with 3eTi to help develop and implement a system that will enhance capabilities within the emergency management community. This one-year testing phase will allow us to provide feedback to the developers, and truly test its functionality,\" stated Clint Pipkin from MEMA's Readiness Division/Recovery Branch at Camp Fretterd Military Reservation located in Reisterstown, Md. \"The system is now being used to provide logistic support at designated relief locations for MEMA Disaster Recovery Center personnel in areas hit hard by Hurricane Isabel.\" Because Earth Alert is a hosted Web-based solution, it can be implemented without buying expensive call center infrastructure, networked computer servers, or special hardware for field deployment. It uses commercially available GPS-enabled wireless phones, off-the-shelf PCs and standard web browsers. During this one-year implementation phase, MEMA will test the system with 10 hand-held units and will provide valuable feedback that will allow 3eTI to customize the software to meet the unique requirements of emergency management personnel in Maryland. The Disaster Recovery Center personnel at relief centers such as Annapolis, and Baltimore, are using a total of 10 Earth Alert units on a day-to-day basis. MEMA is using the Earth Alert system to locate the nearest Emergency Operations Center (EOC) Watch personnel on a map and to obtain their current status. This helps MEMA speed up response times and manage assets. The MEMA EOC can send standard messages and alert messages to the units in the field, and can receive messages from the units with location data. Because of this capability MEMA can keep a log of critical messages and display the messages on a map for better a better understanding of the situation. MEMA is exploring many of the capabilities for further use such as Damage Assessment and First Responder reporting. These capabilities would aide relief efforts because they enable faster reporting and the ability to speed up relief to hard hit areas. These capabilities will require a more wide spread deployment and cooperation with local agencies. MEMA can track personnel status through continuous map positioning, and shadow the progress of critical events through real-time management of personnel. These capabilities enhance personnel management, enable faster incident response time, and can mitigate incidents before they arise. With Earth Alert System capabilities, MEMA is now able to send situation alerts and weather alerts directly to field personnel based on their location or profile allowing the closest and best-equipped individuals to be directly routed to critical situations faster. A successful beta test of the Earth Alert System during the January 2003 inauguration parade of Governor Robert L. Ehrlich Jr. sparked MEMA's decision to implement the system from June 2003 to May 2004. MEMA provided their parade staff with GPS-enabled Nextel two-way radios that allowed them to keep the parade on schedule and to monitor the crowd for suspicious behavior. NASA initially conceived, sponsored and co-developed the first prototype of the warning system to broadcast survival information to isolated populations and then extended the original system to include the U.S. weather and communications satellite systems. From its Office of Commercial Programs, NASA provided funds for the Earth Alert System through the Small Business Innovation Research Program. The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and the Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs provide opportunities for small, high technology companies and research institutions to participate in Government sponsored research and development efforts in key technology areas.  The primary benefit of an SBIR/STTR project for a small business is in obtaining seed money to explore a technical idea without any loss of control or loss of equity, including intellectual property rights."}

Clemson researchers will use data to help improve building codes for coastal areas. In some cases, their findings could actually reduce building costs. Research leader on the projects is Tim Reinhold, a nationally known wind engineer who is a professor of civil engineering at Clemson. \"This gives us one of our first chances to get the high-resolution wind-speed data â near the ground, close to where a storm passes â that we need in order to develop design bases for hurricane-resistant homes,\" said Reinhold. Typical airport anemometers simply aren't designed to collect this type of information. Hurricane-hunting aircraft, meanwhile, only measure wind speed at considerable altitude and usually do not make measurements over land. Each steel-reinforced platform, which weighs up to 4,500 pounds, is specifically designed to withstand hurricane-force winds and features special securing legs. The platforms can be fully extended and secured in place in as little as 20 minutes. The platforms feature three anemometers specifically designed to operate in high-wind storms. The devices will measure wind speed at heights of 33 feet, a standard reference height, and 15 feet, the height of a typical single-story home. That information will then be relayed along steel-reinforced cables to an onboard computer housed in a reinforced box The teams also have permanent instrumentation capability on approximately 35 houses in Florida and South Carolina. The houses, which have different retrofits, have all been pre-wired and can be outfitted with the monitoring equipment in the event of a predicted hurricane. Clemson's Wind Load Test Facility is one of the nation's top laboratories for testing the effects of wind on low-rise structures such as homes and schools. Clemson's research has resulted in some of the most accurate wind tunnel modeling techniques currently available. This work led to development of criteria for wind-tunnel testing sponsored by the National Institute of Standards and Technology."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_774", "content": "The DOWs will deploy at or near the coast in the direct path of the storm. \"From a head-on position,\" says NCAR affiliate scientist Josh Wurman, \"the DOW can collect unprecedented high-resolution data and rapid-scan Doppler radar data from inside the eye.\" At close range the scans will observe fine-scale but potentially damaging storm features as small as 40-feet across, including wind streaks, gusts and other structures. The DOWs are a collaborative effort between NCAR and the Center for Severe Weather Research. Wurman operates the vehicles through the CSWR, with support primarily from the National Science Foundation. \"This is an exciting opportunity to improve our understanding of the finer scale structure of one of nature's most powerful phenomena,\" says Cliff Jacobs, program director in NSF's division of atmospheric sciences. \"Federal support for national centers and university researchers has allowed the nexus of people, tools, and ideas to converge to gain new knowledge about hurricanes.\" The newest of the radar systems, called the Rapid-DOW, sends out six radar beams simultaneously. By raking the sky six times faster than traditional single-beam radars, Rapid-DOW can visualize three-dimensional volumes in five-to-ten seconds and observe boundary layer rolls, wind gusts, embedded tornadoes and other phenomena as they evolve. Back in Boulder, NCAR scientists are running the nation's future Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) model on NCAR's IBM \"Blue Sky\" supercomputer, testing the model's skill at predicting Isabel's intensity, structures and track. Operating on a model grid with data points only 4 kilometers (2.5 miles miles) apart, Blue Sky hums with calculations all night as WRF zooms in on Isabel, bringing into focus the storm's internal structure, including eyewall and rain bands. The result is a high-precision, two-day forecast. In the morning, the model starts over to create a new five-day forecast using a 10-kilometer grid and updated conditions. NCAR's primary sponsor, the National Science Foundation, supported the development of both WRF and the DOW at NCAR. The WRF model is a cooperative effort by NCAR and several federal agencies and military branches. \"It's an exciting opportunity,\" says scientist Jordan Powers, a WRF development manager at NCAR. \"Resolving a hurricane's fine-scale structures in real time with this next-generation weather model is breaking new ground for forecasters and researchers.\" The DOW is pushing technological limits of its own. \"The DOW has revolutionized the study of tornadoes and other violent and small-scale atmospheric phenomena,\" says Wurman. The large, spinning, brightly-colored radar dishes have intercepted the eyes of five hurricanes: Fran, Bonnie, Floyd, Georges and Lili. Data from the retired DOW1 resulted in the discovery of entirely new phenomena in hurricanes, called intense boundary layer rolls, which contain the highest and most dangerous wind gusts. Though Powers won't be using DOW data for WRF's forecasts this week, he and others may compare Wurman's real-world observations with the model results in the future."}

{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_776", "content": "Typically, during the peak of hurricane season, from late August to mid-September, tropical cyclones of interest to U.S. coastal regions form around the Cape Verde Islands off Africa. NASA satellites are critical for helping forecasters determine if all of the ingredients are coming together to create a hurricane. If a hurricane forms, it is critical to know how strong it may be, which coastal communities or sea lanes will be at risk. NASA provides researchers and forecasters with space-based observations, data assimilation, and computer climate modeling. NASA sponsored measurements and modeling of global sea surface temperature, precipitation, winds and sea surface height have also improved understanding of El Nino and La Nina events, which respectively tend to suppress and enhance Atlantic and Gulf hurricane development. Thirty years ago, meteorologists were unable to see the factors in hurricane formation and could only spot a hurricane with still pictures from the TIROS-N satellite. Over the past 10 years, visible and infrared satellite sensors were the workhorses for monitoring hurricanes. Today, multiple NASA satellites exploit everything from radar pulses to microwaves to enhance forecasts, providing data to researchers several times a day.The first ingredient in the hurricane recipe is sea surface temperature of at least 82 F. Unlike traditional infrared satellite instruments, the Aqua satellite's Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E) and the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission's (TRMM) Microwave Imager can detect sea surface temperatures through clouds. This valuable information can help determine if a tropical cyclone is likely to strengthen or weaken. The Jason-1 satellite altimeter provides data on sea surface height, a key measurement of ocean energy available to encourage and sustain hurricanes.Another necessary ingredient is rotating winds over the ocean's surface, precursors to tropical cyclone development. The NASA provided SeaWinds instruments aboard Japan's Midori 2 and NASA's QuikSCAT satellites can detect these winds before other instruments, providing even earlier notice of developing storms to forecasters and scientists. Air temperature and humidity are also important factors. The Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) experiment suite aboard the Aqua satellite obtains measurements of global temperature and humidity throughout the atmosphere. This may lead to improve weather forecasts, improved determination of cyclone intensity, location and tracks, and the severe weather associated with storms, such as damaging winds.Rainfall intensity is the final ingredient, and the Precipitation Radar provided by Japan for the TRMM satellite provides CAT scan-like views of rainfall in the massive thunderstorms of hurricanes. TRMM instruments probe young tropical systems for rainfall intensity and the likelihood of storm development. TRMM also sees \"hot towers\" or vertical columns of rapidly rising air that indicate very strong thunderstorms. These towers are like powerful pistons that convert energy from water vapor into a powerful wind and rain-producing engine. Once a storm develops, TRMM provides an inside view of how organized and tightly spiraled rain bands are, key indicators of storm intensity.TRMM provides tropical cyclone intensity information from the safe distance of space allowing the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) National Hurricane Center and the Department of Defense Joint Typhoon Warning Center to turn to TRMM, QuikSCAT and other NASA satellites for early assessment of storms in the open ocean. The hurricane monitoring capabilities enabled by these satellites are funded by NASA's Earth Science Enterprise, which is dedicated to understanding the Earth as an integrated system and applying Earth System Science to improve prediction of climate, weather, and natural hazards using the unique vantage point of space.For more information and NASA images on the Internet, visit:"}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_777", "content": "A researcher at the Florida A&M University-Florida State University College of Engineering has designed a hurricane shelter that can be built inside most conventional homes to withstand winds of 140 mph - a Category 4 storm - even if the rest of the house is ripped apart.Nur Yazdani, a professor of civil and environmental engineering, said the so-called \"retrofit room\" involves fortifying a bathroom or closet with hurricane straps, anchor bolts, plywood or steel plate walls, an independent ceiling and a steel door to keep its occupants safe. All of these materials are available at most home improvement stores, and the room is fully functional for its original purpose once completed.The shelter can be built for about $3,000 in materials and labor.Yazdani developed the design with a grant FSU received from the Florida Department of Community Affairs' Division of Emergency Management.Faced with chaotic evacuations during hurricane warnings that cause massive traffic backups and fills available space at public shelters, state officials tout the in-home shelter as a safe stay-at-home option. Residents who live directly in a strong hurricane's path or in flood zones would be encouraged to evacuate even if their homes have the shelter, said Craig Fugate, Florida's director of emergency management.\"We want residents to identify and develop safe local shelter options as part of their disaster plans,\" Fugate said. \"If they have taken all the necessary precautions, staying at home is a better alternative than getting out on the roads and possibly putting themselves at risk of greater danger.\"Information on local flood zones and shelters can be found on the state's emergency management Web page at www.floridadisaster.org. Yazdani's report is also temporarily available at this Web site.Yazdani said he wanted to develop a less expensive alternative to an in-house shelter designed for the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The FEMA \"safe room\" is designed to withstand a tornado with winds of 250 mph, but it also carries a price tag of about $6,000 and is difficult to build in most existing homes.Yazdani said the risk of a tornado hitting a home in Florida is much smaller than that of a major hurricane impacting it.\"When I saw FEMA's safe room design, I tried to think of how you could do something like that but at less cost,\" Yazdani said. \"The retrofit room offers a comparable alternative that will withstand the vast majority of hurricanes at a price more people can afford.\"To obtain the specifications for the retrofit room, e-mail Danny Kilcollins at"}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_778", "content": "The instrument may begin flying into storms on board a research plane as early as August, pending approval from the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration. James Lawrence, UH associate professor of geosciences, has studied hurricanes for years, from the ground and from the sky. He says one of the key elements powering a hurricane is how heat is transferred from the ocean's surface into the air, and if his detector is worth its salt, it should shed some light on the engine driving hurricanes. \"How heat is transferred from the ocean's surface into the air is a fundamental question, and understanding the mechanisms of heat transfer will help us make better models of hurricane formation, including models of how they grow in intensity,\" he says. Lawrence says studies such as his are key to understanding the dangers of hurricanes. \"Intensification of a hurricane is a very important issue, and sudden intensification is very dangerous. Unfortunately, this is what forecasters are least able to predict, along with how much rainfall will be produced by a storm.\" One of the ways heat can be transferred from the ocean is by the wind churning up the sea and throwing droplets of sea spray up from the surface. \"Theorists think that there is a significant change in heat transfer as the winds pick up in the interior of the hurricane because you get a lot of sea spray,\" Lawrence says. His results from previous data gathering and research suggest that under the eye wall, which surrounds the center of a hurricane, a significant amount of sea spray is being uplifted. Perhaps as much as 30 percent of the total water and water vapor in the eye wall is being directly ripped off the sea surface, but Lawrence says he needed a new method to prove that hypothesis. \"The suggestion is there, but it's not easy to prove. For salt, there's no question that that water is coming from sea spray,\" he says. \"Those droplets of water get carried up in the eye wall and into rain bands, and they take salt with them. By measuring the salt content, or salinity, of the rain, we should then be able to infer what's happening at the sea surface in terms of sea spray and the transfer of heat from the surface.\" When the first version of Lawrence's device flew on board a research aircraft in the late 1990s, he realized he hadn't taken into account environmental factors that could skew the experiment's results â in this case, a dirty plane. Using a rain collector on the fuselage over the wing of the plane, Lawrence found that as it flew into a hurricane, the first rain collected was very salty. As it flew farther through the storm, the salinity decreased. \"We discovered that we were basically washing the airplane,\" Lawrence says. The plane had been sitting on the ground in Tampa, not far from the Gulf, so it was covered with salt. \"As we started to go through the hurricane, the salt began to wash off the plane and into our collector, giving us those huge numbers.\" To design a new salt detector, Lawrence worked with Hans Hofmeister, director of instrumentation for the UH Department of Chemistry. Hofmeister built a novel device that can be mounted on the very front, or nose, of the plane, where it should avoid detecting water that has splashed off the plane. \"That's our hypothesis, and we hope we can achieve that. Hans has come up with a very clever way of doing this so that we can get continuous, very sensitive, and real-time data over a whole possible range of salt content.\" The UH device has already passed a few tests on the ground â first strapped to the front a Lawrence's pick-up truck while they drove on the freeway, then in a wind tunnel at Texas A&M University. Lawrence, who has been funded by NASA, is currently awaiting final approval to fly the newly-designed instrument on board a hurricane research plane beginning in August. Scientists from the hurricane research division of NOAA determine what flies on the plane, which is operated by NOAA's Aircraft Operations Center in Tampa, Fla.The UH detector is a small cylinder that is flat on the forward end and shaped to attach to the aircraft on the rearward end. Mounted on the front end is the heart of the device, an array of tiny wires lined up parallel with one another. The wires are connected to sophisticated controls and a voltmeter via cables that run through an opening at the rear of the cylinder. Once the device is mounted to the plane, those cables run inside the craft to a control console. Typically, to detect salinity of water, researchers dip two electrodes into a container of solution and measure the amount of current that flows between the wires. But if you want to measure salt levels instantaneously, you can't wait for rain water to collect in a jar as a plane flies through a storm, Hofmeister says. In his design, the wires are exposed to the air as the plane passes through rain and clouds. \"It's the same principle as when you're driving through a rainstorm and water piles up on your windshield,\" Hofmeister says. \"Rain piles up on this slate of wires as it flies through a hurricane. The more salt that's in the water, the easier it is for current to flow between the wires, so the current is higher.\" The salinity detector actually measures voltage, he notes â the higher the current, the lower the voltage reading. Another challenge Hofmeister faced in designing the instrument was making it capable of withstanding a high-voltage shock and still function. As a plane flies through the air, static electricity is generated, which discharges in huge high-voltage sparks. \"This instrument is a very delicate circuit, so I built surge suppressors that would take all that static electricity and get rid of it in order to prevent damage to the circuit,\" Hofmeister says. In his lab, the voltmeter connected to the UH device measures to one millionth of a volt difference in voltage readings, but a shock of 15,000 volts to the salinity detector has no effect â the device still functions normally. \"Our experiments probably won't be used to predict anything about an individual hurricane and its potential strength, but the better our understanding of how hurricanes in general work, the more you may be able to predict where one will go or how powerful it may become,\" Lawrence says."}

Patrick Arnott of the Desert Research Institute (DRI) in Reno, Nev.; and David O. Starr of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Md., co-authored a paper about Hurricane Nora's far-reaching effects. The paper was published in the April 1, 2003, issue of the American Meteorological Society's Journal of Atmospheric Sciences. Scientists were surprised to find what appeared to be frozen plankton in some cirrus crystals collected by research aircraft over Oklahoma, far from the Pacific Ocean. This was the first time examples of microscopic marine life, like plankton, were seen as \"nuclei\" of ice crystals in the cirrus clouds of a hurricane. Nora formed off the Panama coast, strengthened as it traveled up the Baja Peninsula, and the hurricane crossed into California in September 1997. Over the western U.S., Nora deposited a stream of high cirrus, ice crystal, clouds that created spectacular optical effects, such as arcs and halos, above a broad region including Utah and Oklahoma. That stream of cirrus clouds enabled researchers to analyze growth of ice crystals from different nuclei. Different nuclei, like sulfate particles, sea salt and desert dust, affect ice-crystal growth and shape. Torn from the sea surface by strong hurricane winds, sea salt and other particles from evaporated sea spray are carried to the cold upper troposphere in storm updrafts, where the drops freeze and become ice crystals. Plankton, a microscopic organism, is also likely present in the sea spray and is similarly lofted to high levels. \"Understanding how ice crystals grow and what determines their shapes is important in understanding how they interact with sunlight and infrared energy,\" Starr noted. \"These interactions are important processes in the global climate system. They are also critical to sensing cloud properties from space, where NASA uses measurements of the reflected solar radiation to infer cloud physical properties, such as ice-crystal size,\" he said. Data were gathered using ground-based remote sensors at the Facility for Atmospheric Remote Sensing in Salt Lake City and at the Clouds and Radiation Testbed in northern Oklahoma. A research aircraft collected particle samples over Oklahoma. Observations from the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite 9 (West), launched by NASA and operated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, were also used. DRI analyzed the ice crystals collected from Nora. Scientists were using data generated through the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Program. The ARM Program's purpose is obtaining field measurements and developing computer models of the atmosphere. Researchers hope to better understand the processes that control the transfer of solar and thermal infrared energy in the atmosphere, especially in clouds, and at the Earth's surface. The ARM energy measurements also double-check data from the Moderate Imaging Spectroradiometer instrument aboard NASA's Terra and Aqua satellites. By ensuring the satellites are recording the same energy reflected and absorbed by clouds from Hurricane Nora as those provided by the ground data in this study, scientists hope to take fewer ground measurements in the future, and enable the satellites to provide the data. The DOE ARM program, National Science Foundation, and NASA's Earth Science Enterprise funded this research. The Earth Science Enterprise is dedicated to understanding the Earth as an integrated system and applying Earth System Science to improve prediction of climate, weather and natural hazards, such as hurricanes, using the unique vantage point of space."}

The report he will deliver at this year's GSA meeting describes how hurricanes affect coral formations and will help scientists compare modern storm effects to those of the past. Meyer conducted the research with Benjamin Greenstein of Cornell College in Mt. Vernon, Iowa, and recent UC graduate Jill Bries. The trio's work investigated the effect that the frequency of hurricanes had on the geological record contained in coral reefs. In high-frequency hurricane areas like the Bahamas and Florida Keys, coral formations were damaged and broken. Meyer described it \"like a forest fire going through.\" Reefs studied in the southern Caribbean islands of Curacao and Bonaire were well preserved owing to a very low frequency of storms. The reefs of the Caribbean region were formed during the interglacial stages of the Pleistocene epoch when sea levels were much higher; current sea levels have left these reefs exposed and intact. Both areas of reefs were formed by the same species and fairly close together in terms of geological time. By comparing the Caribbean reefs with the newer formations in the Bahaman and Floridian areas, Meyer, Greenstein, and Bries were able to establish a model for looking at older fossil reefs. \"As you go farther back in time,\" said Meyer, \"the reef building species are different and you need a present model to start with. Then you can go back to more ancient reefs to get more insight into the climate and storm patterns of older times.\" Meyer said that Bries obtained funding for the project from Sigma Xi, the Paleobiological Fund, and UC's graduate division."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_781", "content": "The study, the cover story of the May 2 issue of the London-based journal Nature, advances the science of important processes associated with breaking waves, including limiting the heights of ocean waves, the generation of ocean currents, and mixing of the ocean surface. \"One of the most important functions of breaking waves is to transfer momentum from the wind to ocean currents,\" said Melville, a professor of oceanography in the Marine Physical Laboratory and Physical Oceanography Research Division at Scripps. \"Wave breaking also is vital to air-sea exchange processes such as heat and gas transfer, which may have a profound effect on weather and climate.\" In the past, wave breaking has been tracked by so-called \"whitecap coverage,\" in which still or video imagery was used to statically identify ocean whitecaps and the corresponding surface coverage by breaking waves. But those measurements suffered because they failed to account for the motion of the breaking waves, an aspect critical for understanding an array of air-sea interactions. For the new study (part of the Shoaling Waves Experiment, or \"SHOWEX\"), Melville and Peter Matusov (also of Scripps Institution) used high-tech instrumentation aboard a light aircraft to obtain detailed image sequences of breaking waves. The equipment included an airborne video system and differential global positioning system (GPS) technology to precisely characterize breaking processes. The results of the study not only demonstrate that wave breaking can be accurately measured using remote imaging techniques, they help describe aspects of wave growth and decay in unique detail. The information also will be used by scientists to improve descriptions of marine aerosol production and heat and gas transfer. \"With the data weâve taken in the field, plus laboratory measurements, weâll be able to do much to improve models of aerosol generation,\" said Melville. The Nature study sets the stage for two new projects beginning this summer that will attempt to probe characteristics of hurricanes. In the first, with Melville and Scrippsâs Eric Terrill, a new imaging system will be flown aboard a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) P3 \"Hurricane Hunter\" aircraft. Data from this project (part of the Office of Naval Research Coupled Boundary Layers/Air-Sea Transfers, or \"CBLAST\" experiment), to be obtained over the next three years, will be used to measure hurricane-driven whitecaps and ocean spray in an effort to understand their role in hurricane dynamics and thermodynamics. The second project, led by Terrill and Melville, will use modified autonomous ocean profilers to measure the influence of hurricanes on the thermal structure and mixing of the upper ocean, and the air-sea interface. The profilers, originally developed by Scripps Professor Russ Davis, will be deployed by aircraft ahead of hurricanes and transmit data via satellite. \"The improved knowledge of air-sea interaction in hurricanes from both of these projects will lead to improved numerical predictions of hurricane winds, waves, storm surges, and hurricane landfall,\" said Melville. \"The potential monitoring and predictive aspects of these projects are most important as the continuing development and growth of coastal communities requires longer warning and evacuation times to minimize the loss of life and property from hurricanes.\" Funding for the Nature study was provided through grants from the Office of Naval Research (physical oceanography) and the National Science Foundation (ocean sciences). Melville also acknowledges the unique capabilities of NOAAâs Long-EZ aircraft and Tim Crawfordâs \"fearless flying\" during the project."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_782", "content": "Global warming has been tied to increasing amounts of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere from human activities ranging from clearing land to burning fossil fuels. Attention has been focused on US forests as possible sinks for carbon dioxide from various emissions. Estimates of the amount of carbon dioxide taken up by forests vary; predictions based on these estimates are an important factor in policy debates about global warming control. In the March 2002 issue of the journal Environmental Pollution, Steven McNulty, USDA Forest Service Southern Global Change Program Leader, suggests that the effects of hurricanes must be taken into account in predicting the carbon storage capacity of US Forests along the southeastern seaboard. At least one major hurricane hits the southeastern US coastline two out of every three years. Over 55 percent of the land in the southern U.S. is forested: timber damage from one hurricane can exceed $1 billion â and significantly reduce carbon stored. âA single hurricane can convert ten percent of the total annual carbon storage for the United States into dead and downed forest biomass,â said McNulty. âHurricanes leave behind a lot of dead trees that decompose and return carbon to the atmosphere before it can be harvested.â McNulty analyzed hurricane damage data collected between 1900 and 1996 to address three issues related to carbon sequestration. First, he looked at how much carbon is transferred from living to dead carbon pools when trees are broken or uprooted. Second, he explored what happened to the downed trees â whether they were salvage logged, burned, or consumed by insects. Finally, he examined the long-term impacts of hurricanes on forest regeneration and productivity. McNulty found that even though hurricanes do not immediately change the state of carbon in a downed tree, a large amount of accumulated forest carbon is lost in the years following a major storm. For economic reasons, most of the wood from hurricanes is not salvaged. Not only is carbon lost as trees decompose, but the downed wood becomes fuel for wild fires that can kill surviving vegetation and release additional carbon dioxide. âIf increased carbon sequestration is going to be one of the mechanisms used to reduce net emissions of carbon dioxide in the United States,â said McNulty, \"incentives to increase post-hurricane timber salvage need to be addressed.â Hurricanes remove the most mature trees, allowing the younger trees in the forest understory â more active in absorbing and converting carbon to biomass â to take over. Forests fill in the gaps, though former density may not return for generations. âShort-term increases in forest productivity do not compensate for the loss in numbers of trees and the 15 to 20 years needed to recover the leaf area of mature forests,â said McNulty. âHurricanes must be considered a significant factor in reducing long-term carbon storage in US forests.â"}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_783", "content": "At the American Geophysical Union meeting held last month, Benoit Mandelbrot, a professor of mathematical sciences at Yale University who is considered to be the father of fractals, described how he has been using fractals to find order within complex systems in nature, such as the natural shape of a coastline. As a result of his research, earth scientists are taking Mandelbrotâs fractal approach one step further and are measuring past events and making probability forecasts about the size, location, and timing of future natural disasters. \"By understanding the fractal order and scale imbedded in patterns of chaos, researchers found a deeper level of understanding that can be used to predict natural hazards,\" says Christopher Barton, a research geologist at the United States Geological Survey, \"They can measure past events like a hurricane and then apply fractal mathematics to predict future hurricane events.\" In the past, earth scientists have relied on statistical methods to forecast natural hazard events, but when Barton used fractals, he found that these patterns contain a level of information that has never been seen using statistical methods. Barton discovered that by comparing the fractal formulas of the size and frequency of a hurricaneâs wind speed to the historic record of information about past hurricane landfall location and timing that he was able to predict the approximate wind speed of the hurricane when it made landfall at a given coastal location along the United States Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico coasts. Forecasts of hazardous natural phenomena based on the application of fractals are now available to government agencies responsible for planning and responding to natural disasters such the Federal Emergency Management Association and other emergency personnel to be able to better forecast the size, location, and timing of future events. \"Based on the fractal patterns seen over the past 100 years,\" says Barton, \"We can better forecast the probability of a future event.\" Thanks to Dr. Mandelbrot, earth scientists like Dr. Barton have a powerful, new tool to predict future chaotic events of nature."}

Its roof will be wracked apart by two cranes to test the effectiveness of hurricane straps against the combined forces of uplift and sheer. Testing takes place Monday, Dec. 17, outside of Conway.Test homes were damaged by floods in Hurricane Floyd and already slated for destruction. Approximately 15 houses have been used in the Clemson trials. All are in Horry County, a coastal county dominated by the tourist destination Myrtle Beach.\"This takes the lab into absolute real-world conditions, where we can scientifically monitor exactly what happens and evaluate how well the retrofits work,\" said Reinhold, an associate civil engineering professor.Engineering standbys, such as vacuum chambers and pressure transducers, were used during testing, but researchers also expanded the scientific arsenal to include air bags exploding against windows and airborne debris (ie, 2x4âs) pounding walls, shutters and saferooms at 100-mph speeds. The side-by-side comparisons of retrofitted and non-retrofitted areas will allow researchers to determine what works best and installs most easily in the field, said Reinhold.The project is a partnership between Clemson, Horry County, the South Carolina Department of Insurance, the Institute for Business & Home Safety (IBHS), the Horry-Georgetown Homebuilders Association and local building officials from Horry County, Conway and Myrtle Beach. Also involved are the S.C. Sea Grant Consortium and N.C.

{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_785", "content": "The activities were part of CAMEX-4 (The Convection And Moisture EXperiment), a joint effort between NASA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and a number of universities, that ended on September 24.\"We had three flights over Hurricane Humberto in the last three days,\" NASA Goddard Space Flight Center researcher and a mission scientist for Camex-4, Gerry Heymsfield said. \"These were the most comprehensive measurements of the structure of the hurricane ever recorded.\"As Hurricane Humberto raged over the Atlantic Ocean, Heymsfield fitted NASA's high altitude ER-2 aircraft with a downward-looking radar, called an ER-2 Doppler Radar (EDOP). From the ER-2's vantage of 12 miles (20 km) up, the EDOP uses the Doppler shift of rain and ice particles within clouds to measure rain intensity, air speed and velocity within the storm. NASA's ER-2 aircraft provides a unique perspective over the top of the storm and flies so high the pilot needs to wear a spacesuit.Earlier, on September 10, another Goddard scientist, Jeff Halverson, made use of ER-2 to drop temperature and wind sensors into the eye of Hurricane Erin. The sensors, called dropsondes, were automatically released from the plane by a computer-operated system.As they fell, the dropsondes tallied air temperatures and winds through the storm's eye, from the top of the hurricane to the ocean surface. By taking these readings at eight different locations in the hurricane, \"It's as though we obtained a topographical temperature map of the storm,\" says Halverson, who maintains a dual appointment between Goddard and the University of Maryland-Baltimore County's Joint Center for Earth Systems Technology. He adds that Erin had a classic hurricane structure with a well-defined eye, and the new data will provide excellent baselines for figuring out how these storms intensify.When hurricanes occur, heat gets generated inside the center of thunderstorms that eventually make up a hurricane. The heat, created largely by condensation in clouds, causes the air to expand and rise and that lowers air pressure near surface of the water. When the surface pressure lowers, air accelerates from areas of higher pressure surrounding the storm toward the lower pressure area near the sea surface. As it flows, the air picks up some of the spin of the Earth and starts to move counterclockwise in a vortex. The winds begin blowing faster towards the center and the storm intensifies into a hurricane.By using dropsonde measurements of winds, temperature, surface pressure and moisture, and then combining those readings with EDOP data of air motions and precipitation levels in those clouds, the researchers now have necessary data for assessing a hurricane's structure. That's because the EDOP provides information about the clouds that create heat and warm the hurricane's spinning vortex, and in turn, the dropsondes measure the high altitude temperatures that drive the vortex and in turn create more clouds.\"It is significant to understand the temperature inside the eye of the storm at high altitudes because that is something that is not very well known,\" Halverson said. \"To understand whether the storm is intensifying or not you have to know whether the temperature is increasing.\"Halverson's temperature readings and Heymsfield's results \"work best together to answer fundamental questions about the physics that drive a hurricane,\" said Halverson.Scott Braun, another NASA Goddard Space Flight Center researcher, will now use the new data to create detailed computer simulations of hurricanes. These models may help to better predict future hurricanes.The dropsonde system was developed by the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), and installed onto NASA's ER-2 aircraft.The Convection And Moisture EXperiment (CAMEX) was the fourth in a series of field research investigations sponsored by the Earth Science Enterprise at NASA Headquarters, Washington, DC.

Test subjects range from brick ranch to wooden two-story; all were damaged by floods in Hurricane Floyd and slated for destruction in Horry County. âThis takes the lab into absolute real-world conditions where we can scientifically monitor exactly what happens and evaluate how well the retrofits work,\" said Tim Reinhold, Clemson associate civil engineering professor. Reinhold and his team of five students are making side-by-side comparisons of retrofitted and non-retrofitted areas to determine what works best and can be installed most easily by contractors in the field. Work started earlier this summer, but the most visual blowdown will be Tuesday, Aug. 14, when a two-story home takes a tumble for science. A crane will pull apart roof and wall segments to demonstrate the differences in strength that can be achieved by using different construction details and procedures. Engineering standbys, such as vacuum chambers and pressure transducers, will be used, but researchers will also expand the scientific arsenal to include airbags exploding against windows and air-borne debris (ie, 2x4âs) pounding walls, shutters and saferooms at speeds of 100 mph. Additional homes may be tested in late September. The project is a partnership between Clemson, Horry County, the South Carolina Department of Insurance, the Institute for Business & Home Safety (IBHS), the Horry-Georgetown Homebuilders Association and local building officials from Horry County, Conway and Myrtle Beach. Retrofits under study include the effectiveness of adding screws or ring-shank nails as a supplement to the existing nailing pattern on news roofs; using adhesives applied from the attic space on existing roofs; bracing gable roof ends to prevent the failure; installing hurricane straps or retrofit brackets to strengthen the roof-wall connection; using structural ties to improve anchorage of porch roofs or substantial overhangs. Results of the tests will be compiled by Thanksgiving. Clemson has one of the nation's top research facilities to study and mediate the effects of high winds on low-rise structures such as homes and schools. The nearly $84,000 project will provide more accurate estimates of retrofit costs and the potential benefits of such measures, said Jeff Sciaudone, associate director of engineering for the Institute for Business & Home Safety. The IBHS is an initiative of the insurance industry to reduce deaths, injuries, property damage, economic losses and human suffering caused by natural disasters. \"This information is essential for homeowners wanting to determine whether the expense and disruption of the remedial measures are worth the investment,â said Sciaudone. For Horry County, hurt by Hurricane Floyd in September 1999, the project is an opportunity to take back a little of what Floyd took away. \"The county lost millions of dollars. But projects like this will help make us better prepared for the next hurricane,\" said Paul Whitten, director of public safety for Horry County. The test homes are among the 29 homes bought as part of FEMA's repetitive flood buyout program in Horry County. The retrofitting and testing will take place this summer. The land must be returned to an open, undeveloped state in the fall of 2001 to meet the requirements of the FEMA buyout program."}

The breakthrough points toward future forecasting power that will soon be available. NCAR is part of a team now building a model similar to the MM5, but with more advanced capabilities, that will generate daily weather forecasts for the National Weather Service (NWS) beginning in 2004.\"Improved skill in forecasting in a research setting often does not quickly find its way into operational forecast models,\" says Cliff Jacobs, program director in NSF's division of atmospheric sciences. \"This research has the best of all possible results: improved forecasting techniques that developed as a result of an investment in research, that likely will quickly make their way into operational models.\"For their MM5 experiment, Davis and Powers studied Hurricane Diana, which struck North Carolina in 1984. Diana was chosen because of ample surface data and because a well-defined nontropical low preceded its formation. The MM5 successfully reproduced several stages in Diana's development, from its original state as a nontropical low to its intensification to hurricane status more than a day later.According to Davis, \"One of the remaining mysteries about hurricanes is how they form, especially when they're influenced by midlatitude weather systems that move into the subtropics and tropics. We hope that by analyzing the mechanisms behind storm formation in these simulations, we can make hypotheses of tropical cyclone formation that can be tested using aircraft, radar, and satellite data. We also hope to understand what's needed to predict storm formation in operational weather forecast models.\"Computer models used for day-to-day weather prediction have become increasingly adept at projecting a hurricane's motion. Yet even the best models have little skill in predicting intensity, especially the rapid strengthening often noted in the most powerful hurricanes. Part of the problem is that the compact core of a hurricane, including the spiral bands of showers and thunderstorms that gather and focus energy, canât be modeled in sufficient detail on the computers and models used for everyday forecasting.The new Weather Research and Forecasting Model and more powerful computers will allow for the type of fine-scale detail in the MM5 to be simulated for daily forecasting.

{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_788", "content": "On islands devoid of cats, the mice rebound more quickly. Thomas W. Schoener, Ph.D., and David A. Spiller, of the University of California, Davis, and Jonathan B. Losos, Ph.D., professor of biology at Washington University in St. Louis were studying the effects of a large predator lizard species, the curly-tailed lizard, on both its prey, a smaller species called the brown anole, and on the entire food chain on 12 baseball-diamond sized islands in the northern Bahamas. Hurricane Floyd struck the area in the fall of 1999, drastically changing the experiment. In 1997, just months after introducing the large predatory lizard, Leiocephalus carinatus, to islands on which the smaller lizard, Anolis sagrei, lived, the biologists had been stunned to find that anole populations were just half those on six other islands where the curly-tailed lizard did not exist; this difference presumably was a result of the much larger species eating the smaller one. In late 1999, two months after the hurricane, the researchers found that anole populations on the six islands with the predator were much more greatly reduced from pre-hurricane levels than were no-predator control islands. One year later, the control populations had all returned to their pre-hurricane numbers, but most of the populations on the predator-present islands had failed to recover and several were extinct. \"The study shows dramatically that the presence of a top predator on an island affects the vulnerability of a prey population to a catastrophic event,\" says Losos. \"The study is rare because it integrates two areas of ecological research: one studies the effect that rare catastrophic events have in determining the structure of a community; the other examines the effect of a predator on lower levels of the food chain.\" The study was published in the July 5, 2001 issue of Nature. The work was supported by the National Science Foundation. Amazing to the researchers was the fact that there was any survival at all on the islands. Hurricane Floyd was a Category IV hurricane with maximum winds greater than 150 miles per hour that blew lizards off the islands or immersed them in a ten feet wall of water. A previous study by the same authors, published in Science in 1998, had shown that a catastrophic hurricane could exterminate lizard populations. When they returned to the islands this time a month after Hurricane Floyd has passed, they expected to find the same result. Much to their surprise, not only were the populations not extinct, but all of the survivors were baby lizards that must have hatched since the hurricane. They surmised that, as with the previous hurricane, although all lizards present on the island were swept away or drowned, lizard eggs must have been able to survive the hurricane and give rise to a next generation. \"l don't think anyone would have predicted that lizard eggs could survive immersion in saltwater for six hours,\" says Losos, who has duplicated the salty conditions in the laboratory and has found that eggs less than ten days old hatch well when put in salt water for that long. The researchers have three possible explanations for the greater number of lizards on islands on which the predators were not present. One, on islands with the predator, the populations of the prey species already were significantly declining before the hurricane, making extinction easier. Moreover, surviving curly-tailed lizards could have further reduced the anole populations after the hurricane. However, this explanation does not seem adequate because not all predator islands had curly-tailed lizards after the hurricane. Moreover, on those islands on which curly-tails were still found, the survivors were, like the anoles, hatchlings. Although curly-tailed lizard hatchlings are larger than anole hatchlings, they probably are not large enough to eat other lizards. So, continued predation by curly tails after the hurricane probably does not explain the difference between the predator and no-predator islands. A second explanation is that the anoles, forced off the ground and into the bush by the rampaging curly-tailed lizards, may have deposited their eggs in less secure places, such as trees rather than rock holes or other more protected sites. This would make the eggs deposited more vulnerable to hurricane winds and water. The third explanation suggests that,because the anoles were forced to shift their habitat, moving far up into the bushes to avoid the curly tails, they may have had reduced hunting success or mating opportunities so that in the presence of the predator, they were producing fewer eggs, which in turn would result in fewer potential hurricane survivors. \"We have three hypotheses, but it's not clear if any one alone explains what happened,\" says Losos. \"We speculate that the presence of a predator, besides reducing the population, also changes the ecology in such a way that the the anole populations are more vulnerable to a natural catastrophe, but we still don't know what is the exact causal mechanism.\" Losos says that the three biologists will continue to monitor the islands and hope to restart the experiment in the spring of 2003. The intent is to study how the anole lizards adapt to the new habitats they must occupy in the presence of curly-tails."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_789", "content": "Nothing can prevent a storm from hitting, but a team of North Carolina State University researchers is testing new designs for \"breakaway walls\" that could reduce damage to homes and buildings should a hurricane make landfall. Their findings are included in the most recent edition of the Federal Emergency Management Agencyâs (FEMA) Coastal Construction Manual. Breakaway walls are designed for use on the ground floor of buildings in coastal flood zones. To minimize damage from storm surges, the National Flood Insurance Program suggests that these homes and businesses be built on pilings, or \"stilts,\" and that the ground floor be used only for access, parking or storage. Property owners who choose to enclose this space are urged to use walls that will break away from the rest of the house when pressure exerted on them by a storm surge reaches a predetermined stress load -- usually between 10 and 20 pounds per square foot. Stronger walls would absorb the force of the surging water, jeopardizing the integrity of the entire foundation.To determine what materials and designs will work best for breakaway walls, a trio of NC State researchers tested eight experimental wall prototypes. The researchers are Dr. C.C. Tung, professor emeritus of civil engineering; Spencer M. Rogers Jr., senior coastal engineering specialist with North Carolina Sea Grant and an adjunct civil engineering faculty member; and Dr. Bohumil Kasal, associate professor of wood and paper science. Each 8 x 8-foot wood-wall prototype was tested in simulated hurricane storm surge conditions at a wave tank testing facility at Oregon State University in Corvallis, Ore. The researchers placed the prototypes into the tank, which measures 342 feet long, 12 feet wide and 15 feet deep, and directed increasingly strong waves and rising water levels at them until they broke apart. Due to the size and depth of the tank, the researchers were able to test when and how the walls would fail in hurricane-force breaking waves, which exert an exceedingly high-pressure burst against walls as they crest. Based on their findings, the researchers developed practical guidelines for builders to follow, such as using exterior siding no thicker than Â½-inch plywood or equivalent material; using studs no bigger than 2x4s for breakaway walls; and placing the studs at least 24 inches or more apart. A FEMA technical bulletin containing the full results from the NC State-Oregon State research study on breakaway walls is on the Web at http://www.fema.gov/MIT/job15.pdf. The research was funded by the National Science Foundation and FEMA.Next, the NC State trio would like to test unreinforced hollow-cell masonry walls -- also known as cinder block walls. Because they sink, hollow cinder blocks have the advantage of not becoming large, floating debris after a hurricane, making cleanup easier and reducing potential damage to surrounding buildings. However, testing cinder block walls is more difficult than testing wood walls, because of long cure times for the mortar and the potential of damage to the wave tank itself. FEMAâs Coastal Construction Manual is available on a CD-ROM with interactive links for calculations, cross-references and other useful Web sites. The CD-ROM and a printed version of the manual -- which fills three binders -- are available from the FEMA Publications Service Center at (800) 480-2520. There is no charge for single copies."}

The entire rig -- trailer, pedestal and radar dish -- will stand 14 feet high, and the antenna dishes themselves will be eight feet in diameter. \"The large antenna will focus more energy for better resolution, allowing us to detect smaller storms, like tornadoes,\" he observed. \"If they were any larger, however, they couldn't go down the road, and the whole driving force behind SMART-R is that it's mobile.\" A joint project of Texas A&M, Texas Tech University, the University of Oklahoma, and the National Severe Storms Laboratory (NSSL), the dishes are being built in the basement of the geosciences building on the Texas A&M campus, while the NSSL is outfitting the trailers at its headquarters in Norman, Okla. Both trailers and mounting pedestals must be specially designed to be strong enough to withstand the tremendous loads generated by high winds hitting the big dishes. \"In March, we'll use a crane to hoist the dishes out of our basement and mount them on the trailers,\" Biggerstaff said. \"Once we've got the dishes on the trucks, we'll take them down to Florida during August and September -- peak hurricane season -- for their first major field test.\" Although SMART-R is especially designed to image the precipitation and winds that occur within any strong storm, including tornadoes, microburst, and horizontal windstorms, Biggerstaff says its real advantage will be in allowing researchers to track hurricanes once they hit land. \"Tornadic storms have been well studied,\" he said. \"And when hurricanes are over water, chase planes equipped with Doppler radar can fly into them and take wind speed and other measurements. But once a hurricane hits land, it spawns multiple tornadoes, making conditions too dangerous for weather planes to fly in.\" SMART-R can be placed off to the side of the hurricane's initial landfall zone, as much as 50 to 100 miles away, and measure at a distance the hurricane's wind field over a broad area. Computers mounted in the cabs of the mobile radar trucks will contain software to analyze and archive the radar data. \"More people die from the inland floods that accompany hurricanes than from the winds themselves,\" Biggerstaff said. \"SMART-R will enable us to track the evolution of hurricane's changing wind patterns and predict how much rain to expect.\" \"We'll be able to deploy the SMART-R rigs with only three days advance notice, from Texas to South Carolina,\" he observed. \"The mobility of having the radar dishes on trucks will make such quick response possible.\" The Gulf Coast has suffered hurricane and tornado damage on many occasions, such as on June 17, 1997, when 190,000 Houston homes lost power due to severe straight-line winds on that day. \"On that occasion, the storms were small and evolved rapidly,\" Biggerstaff said. \"There weren't enough radars close enough together to allow us to make accurate predictions. SMART-R, with its rapid deployment, will allow us to connect enough data to make better forecasts and warn people earlier of approaching storm danger.\" Older technology, such as cars equipped with sensors to measure winds and barometric pressure and weather balloons released from vans, did not give meteorologists enough information to accurately predict when high winds would occur on the surface of the ground. Old algorithms generated up to an 80 percent false alarm rate, with only a 40 percent prediction success, Biggerstaff said. \"The dishes we're building are basically modifications of surplus radar apparatus from the National Weather Service,\" he observed. \"Three years ago we went to Lubbock, Texas, and Meridian, Miss., and dismantled old dishes and brought them here. Jerry Guynes, senior engineer for the Department of Atmospheric Sciences, and Rick O'Neill, a machinist for the Department of Oceanography, have been creating modifications from raw metal to make SMART-R a reality.\" \"There have been radars on trucks before,\" Biggerstaff said. \"But no one has gone to so much trouble to make them as rugged as SMART-R will be.\""}

NCAR's primary sponsor is theNational Science Foundation.The earth's average temperature has risen about 0.6 degree  Celsius(1.1 degree  Fahrenheit) since the start of the 20th century. Thetrend is most obvious in higher daily minimum temperatures. Duringthe same period precipitation has increased over land in the mid- tohigh latitudes and decreased in the tropics. These two temperatureand precipitation trends together can lead to changes in extremeweather, say the scientists.Some changes have already been observed over the last century and areexpected to escalate. These include an increase in very hot days insome areas, higher minimum temperatures with fewer frost days, andheavier short-term rainfall (lasting one or several days), especiallyin the midlatitudes. In the United States, incidents of heavyrainfall over several days increased most noticeably in the southernMississippi River Valley, Southwest, Midwest, and Great Lakes.Other changes are expected to appear later in this century asgreenhouse gases continue to accumulate, trapping more heat in theatmosphere. Among them is a worldwide drying out of midcontinentalareas during summer, with an increased chance of drought. Enhancedevaporation and higher temperatures would eventually outweighprecipitation increases in those inland areas. In North America, thecentral and southeast regions will get the hottest and driest, withthe West Coast probably less affected because of its heavier rainfalland more moist soil.There is no consensus yet on future trends for El Nino, hurricanes,and midlatitude storms. Scientists have recently embedded fine-scaleregional models into global climate models to predict trends inhurricane number, intensity, and track shifts. Early results show atendency for a future increase in hurricane intensity. Scientistsexpect this technique to yield better estimates in the future asmodel resolution improves.Some models show slightly warmer El Ninos in the future, but a moreconsistent result is a trend toward a generally warmer ocean surfacein the central and eastern equatorial Pacific, says Meehl. Future ElNinos would then be superimposed on a warmer surface, bringing evenheavier rainfall to the central and eastern Pacific and lighterrainfall over Southeast Asia than occurred during the 1997 El Nino.But results vary from model to model and the jury is still out on thefuture of El Nino.Growth in both population and wealth, along with demographic shiftsto storm-prone areas, has made the United States more vulnerable toweather assaults. Total federal relief payments for weather-causeddisasters from 1990 through 1997 hit $12 billion. Costs are expectedto soar if extreme weather intensifies over the next century.Researchers studying wild plants and animals have documented climate-induced extinctions, shifts in species range, and other seasonalbehavior changes. Some gradual biological changes may be responses tochanges in extreme weather and climate events."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_793", "content": "Scientists traditionally rely on satellite pictures to study the telltale swirl of clouds of a forming storm. However, the SeaWinds instrument aboard the QuikSCAT satellite can look through the cloud cover and measure winds at the ocean's surface.        According to a new study by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and NASA researchers expected to be published in a major scientific journal, SeaWinds can detect the closed circle of winds that characterize a tropical depression up to 46 hours sooner than conventional means.        \"The SeaWinds data can help us in two ways,\" says paper author Kristina Katsaros, director of NOAA's Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory, Miami, Fla. \"They can detect tropical depressions early and help us improve our models. With more accurate information on the surface wind speed and direction in hurricanes at all stages, our models can do a better job of predicting a hurricane's evolution and course.\"        QuikSCAT was launched in June 1999. It travels over ninety percent of the ice-free oceans every day with a high-frequency microwave scatterometer that provides detailed information on sea surfaces that can be translated into wind speed and direction.        In their NASA-supported study, Katsaros and her colleagues looked at SeaWinds data from the regions where 12 of the named storms in the 1999 hurricane season formed. Eight of the storms eventually developed into hurricanes. The researchers then examined the data collected 12 to 48 hours in advance of the storms being declared tropical depressions.        While the SeaWinds instrument wasn't always upstream of all 12 storms, it was in position to provide wind data on eight. In those cases, it was able to detect the closed wind circulation well before it could be seen as cloud swirls on the GOES satellite image. The lead times ranged from three hours for Hurricane Irene to 46 hours for Hurricane Lenny.        Being able to detect tropical depressions early is especially important in increasing warning times in regions like the Gulf of Mexico, where storms can grow quickly into hurricanes and can make landfall within a few days. Early detection also may help the National Hurricane Center plan the best use of its resources to keep watch on developing storms.        \"The ability of SeaWinds to see tropical depressions at their earliest stage gives us the opportunity to identify and study the elements that create hurricanes,\" says co-author W.

In a separate study, Liu combined SeaWinds data on winds with information from another instrument, the Tropical Rain Measuring Mission (TRMM), which can also can see through clouds and measure rainfall in hurricanes. \"Hurricanes are especially devastating when they are accompanied by strong winds and heavy rain,\" says Liu. \"QuickSCAT and TRMM provide the only opportunity for us to view the interplay between wind and rain before landfall and help us to understand and predict hurricanes.\" The results of this study appeared in the June 6 issue of Eos, Transactions of the American Geophysical Union.        \"This year the QuikSCAT data will be incorporated into a surface-wind analysis system of NOAA's Hurricane Research Division to produce the surface windfields in tropical storms in near real time,\" says Kastaros. \"This will help the National Hurricane Center in making decisions about warning the public when a storm threatens landfall.\"        QuikSCAT data are available from NOAA's National Environmental Satellite and Information Service on the Internet at        Managed for NASA, JPL is a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena."}

Graduate student Tony Castells is already in Miami, installing the instruments in the aircraft; Carswell will join him in early August, when the bigger storms are expected to begin brewing. The UMass team is responsible for sending real-time data to the National Hurricane Center. This information is used to establish landfall warnings and intensity reports. Pinpoint forecasts give people in threatened areas time to protect their property and evacuate to safety, according to Carswell. \"We do research that has an immediate positive impact on people's safety,\" said Carswell. \"That's a pretty neat experience.\" Flying through the wall of a hurricane \"feels like riding a spinning carnival ride, mounted on a roller-coaster,\" said Carswell, an engineer with the University's Microwave Remote Sensing Laboratory (MIRSL). Satellite images offer an idea of a storm's location and intensity, Carswell said. But it takes reconnaissance flights to get the more precise information that is critical to forecasting the storm's path. Missions last about 10 hours, and entail anywhere from five to more than 15 passes through a storm's eye, in a cross-shaped pattern, in a P-3 airplane equipped to withstand winds whipping up to 180 miles an hour. The remote sensors are designed and constructed by researchers at the UMass lab, part of the department of electrical and computer systems engineering. A specially modified radar \"looks\" at the water surface, as well as the rain, to determine the storm's wind speed and wind direction. Scientists are also interested in determining how much water is in a storm system, since flooding can cause more damage than wind - as Hurricane Floyd demonstrated last year. This is Carswell's fourth season as a hurricane hunter, and the ninth year UMass has been involved in such reconnaissance missions. He flies along with researchers from the Hurricane Research Division of the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Aircraft Operations Center."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_797", "content": "During the 20th century, floods were the number-one disaster in the United States in terms of lives lost and property damage, according to the new fact sheet by the USGS. Flooding has caused the deaths of more than 10,000 people since 1900. Property damage from flooding now totals over $1 billion each year in the United States. The fact sheet discusses 32 significant floods that occurred during the 20th century. The floods were determined to be significant based on a combination of factors including lives lost, and total damage and are broken down into six types of floods: large regional flooding, flash floods, storm surge floods, ice-jam floods, dam and levee failure and mudflow floods. âThe USGS routinely makes many direct measurements during floods and after floods subside,â said USGS research hydrologist and fact sheet author Charles Perry. âWe based this new fact sheet on more than 110 years of data that the USGS has collected.âThe centuryâs deadliest flood occurred in Galveston, Texas, during a September 1900 Hurricane. As the superstorm rolled ashore along the Gulf Coast, more than 6,000 persons lost their lives in the monster hurricaneâs storm surge and wind. Ninety percent of the people killed in hurricanes drown as flood waters rise quickly from the storm surge and heavy rains.Flash floods from intense thunderstorms are also deadly. In June 1972, 237 persons lost their lives along Rapid Creek during the Rapid City S.D. flood. Four years later in July 1976, 144 persons were killed by flash floods on the Big Thompson and Cache la Poudre Rivers in Colorado.Nationwide, half of all flash flood deaths are related to automobiles. The fact sheet diagrams the usually fatal consequence of driving through floodwaters. âWater only one foot deep flowing over a road can exert more than 500 pounds of lateral force, which sweeps an automobile into the much deeper water along the roadside,â Perry said.Floods are also the most costly of all natural disasters in the United States. In the spring and summer of 1993, long periods of excessive rainfall in the upper Mississippi River Basin flooded nine states, killed 48 people and resulted in record losses of more than $20 billion -- about half of these damages were to residences, businesses, public facilities, and transportation facilities. More than 55,000 homes were damaged or destroyed and 532 counties received federal disaster aid.The USGS maintains more than 7,000 gaging stations throughout the United States, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands to monitor streamflow. Real-time streamflow information for most of these stations can be accessed through the World Wide Web, providing flood warning for those in harmâs way. These gages can also be connected directly to warning devices in flash-flood prone areas. All streamflow information is provided by the USGS to various federal, state and local cooperating agencies as well as the general public. The information is available at Copies of Fact Sheet 024â00, âSignificant Floods in the United States During the 20th CenturyâUSGS Measures a Century of Floods,â by Charles A. Perry, are available from the USGS, Information Services, Box 25286, Federal Center, Denver, CO 80225â0286, or call 1â 888âASKâUSGS. The fact sheet may be viewed on the Web at: As the nationâs largest water, earth and biological science and civilian mapping agency, the USGS works in cooperation with more than 2,000 organizations across the country to provide reliable, impartial, scientific information to resource managers, planners, and other customers. This information is gathered in every state by USGS scientists to minimize the loss of life and property from natural disasters, to contribute to the conservation and the sound economic and physical development of the nationâs natural resources, and to enhance the quality of life by monitoring water, biological, energy, and mineral resources."}

These findings were reported today in the Journal Science, by Frank Wentz and colleagues at Remote Sensing Systems, Santa Rosa, CA, who also are TRMM Science Team members.Science team members have found that data from the TRMM Microwave Imaging (TMI) sensor onboard the spacecraft has great potential to increase the accuracy of tropical storm and climate forecasts.  Microwave radiation penetrates clouds with little loss of signal thereby providing an uninterrupted view of the ocean surface whereas much of the infrared radiation, typically used for measuring sea-surface temperatures from satellites, are blocked by cloud cover. \"The microwave imager can give consistent readings of sea-surface temperatures even through clouds,\" said Wentz, director of Remote Sensing Systems. \"To date weâve been limited by infrared sensors. Having the complete picture of ocean surface temperatures should greatly improve numerical models being run by the National Weather Service.\"After a long wait the satellite technology for measuring the ocean's temperature through clouds is now operational,\" said Wentz. \"We expect that this new satellite capability will have a major impact on ocean sciences and storm forecasting.\"The first microwave radiometers operating at low frequencies were flown on the SeaSat and Nimbus-7 missions launched in 1978. Those instruments demonstrated the feasibility of measuring sea-surface temperatures with microwaves. The usefulness of these early radiometers were constrained by a limited calibration system. Though subsequent microwave radiometers, such as the Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I) have improved calibration systems, they still lacked the low frequency channels needed to accurately retrieve sea-surface temperatures.Sea-surface temperature play a fundamental role in the exchange of energy, momentum, and moisture between the ocean and the atmosphere and is a central factor of air-sea interactions and climate variability. A better understanding of air-sea dynamics will translate into better weather forecasting.\"Better sea-surface temperature readings will help the models determine if the storms will gain strength,\" said Max Mayfield, acting director, National Hurricane Center, Miami, FL. \"Warm tropical waters are a fuel for hurricanes and other storms -- helping them grow in intensity.\"This is particularly important when it comes to the forecasting of El NiÃ±o and La NiÃ±a, which have a profound effect on the worldâs climate, and are a dramatic manifestation of the coupling of sea-surface temperature and atmospheric circulation.TRMM has produced continuous data since December 1997. Tropical rainfall, which typically falls between 35 degrees north latitude and 35 degrees south latitude, comprises more than two-thirds of the rainfall on Earth. TRMM is NASAâs first mission dedicated to observing and understanding tropical rainfall and how it affects the global climate.In the future, this all weather capability to observe sea-surface temperature will continue from the NASA Earth Observing satellite called \"Aqua,\" which is scheduled for launch late this year.TRMM is a joint U.S.-Japanese mission and part of NASAâs Earth Science Enterprise, a long-term research program designed to study the Earth's land, oceans, air, ice and life as a total system.

{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_800", "content": "Not a comforting thought for the 70 percent of the state's residents who live in coastal zones -- most of which are at or below sea level.But Stone is trying to change all that, hoping to significantly improve the predictive power of computer models through measurement of storm surge and other oceanographic phenomena in the Gulf of Mexico. This hurricane season, with the help of funding from several state and federal agencies, including a recent million-dollar grant from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Louisiana will be better prepared than ever to monitor hurricane activity in the Gulf.Just two years ago, most of Louisiana's coastline was devoid of any type of accurate ocean-monitoring system, Stone said. Of the 20 federally funded weather buoys located in the Gulf, only one was near Louisiana's coast, leaving a vast gap in ocean-monitoring instrumentation. And the buoys that did exist did not provide any information on storm surge. So when meteorologists predicted the potential storm surge accompanying a hurricane, they were forced to do so without the key offshore information that could make the predictions more accurate. Stone said storm specialists constantly confront problems associated with lack of measurement data. In addition, flood maps used to identify areas of likely inundation by storm surges are not always correct, he said.\"In 1995, when Hurricane Opal hit Florida, the storm-surge estimates were seriously under-predicted,\" Stone said. \"The experts predicted a surge that was 5 feet less than what actually hit the coast. That difference can mean the inundation of hundreds of square miles, which can impact thousands of people.\" Stone, who teaches in LSU's Department of Oceanography and Coastal Sciences, has been working to fill the gaps in the Gulf with stationary ocean-observing platforms that measure a wide range of oceanographic and meteorologic conditions, including storm surge and various wave parameters.The program, called WAVCIS -- Wave/Current/Surge Information System -- is the most advanced program of its kind in the U.S., he said. \"We're trying to take the guesswork out of potentially dangerous offshore situations,\" Stone said. In the past two years, Stone and his team from LSU's Coastal Studies Institute have received funding for four new platforms, one of which just went online last month. The stations, which were designed and built by Stone and his team, include instruments attached to oil platforms above and below water and on the floor of the Gulf. The information gathered at these offshore sites is transmitted to computers at LSU's Coastal Studies Institute via a satellite-based cellular telephone network. There, it is examined for quality-control purposes and distributed worldwide via the Internet. The data are also archived at LSU for ongoing research.Added to the data collected from the existing buoys, the information from the new stations will help scientists and emergency-preparedness personnel more accurately predict storm surges and plan voluntary or mandatory evacuations.\"We now have more offshore information pertaining to waves and currents than we've ever had before,\" Stone said. \"For the coming hurricane season we will be in a better position than ever to assess the early effects of hurricanes as they come into the Gulf. We have crossed a new threshold.\"\"Until now, no one has measured storm surge during large offshore events to the degree that we will. By measuring surge, predictions will be much more accurate,\" Stone said. \"We will soon have instrumentation several hundred miles out into the Gulf. If we start detecting storm surge that far out, we can get a better read on the magnitude of surge closer to shore. The earlier we can get that information to the state's emergency-preparedness personnel, the greater the opportunity to reduce risk to life and property.\" Stone said that, along with earlier warnings, the new stations will provide information on which areas of the coast would be impacted most by storm surge, winds and waves. Such information could help people prepare and, in turn, could save insurance companies millions of dollars in claims. He also said the stations will provide for improved understanding of oceanographic conditions during all types of weather.\"We have already learned quite a bit about air-sea interaction this winter with having three stations online around the clock,\" Stone said. \"I am very excited about having detailed information on offshore wave dynamics during big events such as Hurricane Andrew -- a storm that whet our appetites in 1992 for better measurements offshore.\"Stone said there is a major effort in the U.S. to create an integrated ocean-observing system. Since LSU has partnered with several other institutions, including the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Texas A&M University and various research arms of the U.S. Navy, the university is poised to play a leading role in that effort, Stone said. He also said the infrastructure he is developing offshore will give LSU an advantage over other institutions in obtaining research funding at the national level. Other grants that have helped Stone fund the WAVCIS project came from the state's Oil Spill Research and Development Program, the Louisiana Board of Regents and the Louisiana Department of Natural Resources. Stone also has grant proposals pending with the National Science Foundation and the U.S. Office of Naval Research.For more information on the WAVCIS program, check the WAVCIS Web site at"}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_801", "content": "According to Anthony Lupo, MU assistant professor of atmospheric sciences, and Grant Johnston, an undergraduate student in atmospheric sciences, long- and short-term changes in the surface temperature of the Pacific Ocean have an impact on the occurrence and intensity of Atlantic Ocean hurricanes. The researchers examined the variability of hurricane intensity from 1938 to 1999 using data compiled by Colorado State University's Tropical Meteorology Project Archive. They then compared this data with the occurrence of El Nino and La Nina events and the two phases of the North Pacific Oscillation (NPO), a 50- to 70-year sea surface temperature variation. \"The NPO is like a giant, long-lived El Nino,\" Lupo said. \"The first phase, NPO1, is characterized by warmer surface temperatures in the Eastern Pacific and lower surface temperatures in the Western Pacific. The second phase, NPO2, exhibits the reverse conditions.\" Lupo added that although previous research has shown there are fewer hurricanes during an El Nino year than during a La Nina year, few studies have examined how El Nino and La Nina variability affect the intensity of hurricanes. \"Our research not only addresses this issue, but superimposes these findings on variability associated with the NPO,\" he said. After analyzing the 62 years of hurricane data, Lupo and Johnston arrived at the following conclusions: -- Hurricane occurrence and intensity are higher during La Nina years. -- El Nino effects are enhanced by the NPO1, causing fewer and less intense hurricanes during El Nino years. -- El Nino-related variability is not evident during the NPO2 phase. -- In general, hurricane occurrence and intensity has been higher during the NPO2 phase. Scientists believe the NPO now has shifted back into the NPO2 phase. \"Because the 2000 season will exhibit the effects of La Nina, we can expect a greater number of hurricanes and a chance for more severe hurricanes,\" Lupo said. \"But due to the influence of the NPO2, this season lacks any predictability.\" The National Weather Digest has accepted Lupo and Johnston's paper, which is scheduled to be published later this year."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_802", "content": "The findings relate to westerly winds in the Pacific associated with a cycle called the Madden-Julian Oscillation. Data culled from climate and weather records from 1949 through 1997 show that, about 15 days after detection of those winds in the western Pacific, hurricanes and tropical storms are four times more likely to form in the gulf and in the western Caribbean, the scientists said. The area extends from eastern Texas to about the eastern edge of Cuba.\"If you saw a relatively strong wind burst coming across the western Pacific, you could say that within a couple of weeks you might expect hurricane activity in the Gulf of Mexico,\" said Eric Maloney, a UW atmospheric sciences doctoral student. He and Dennis Hartmann, a UW atmospheric sciences professor, report their findings in the March 17 edition of Science.Having advance knowledge that conditions will be favorable for hurricanes to form will give officials and residents of the Gulf Coast and Caribbean islands more time to prepare, and also could prove valuable to shipping interests, the scientists said.\"You can say maybe a week in advance that there are likely to be hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico, but I can't tell you whether they're likely to hit New Orleans or Galveston,\" Hartmann said.Florida appears to be very vulnerable to such storms, Maloney said. \"Florida is much more likely to be hit by a hurricane or tropical storm during westerly events.\"The Madden-Julian Oscillation repeats every 30 to 60 days. It rises in the Indian Ocean and stays close to the equator as it moves across the Pacific. The leading area of the system typically carries the easterly winds that are predominant in the tropics. The center of the system often contains storm activity, and the westernmost section carries the telltale westerly winds.Maloney and Hartmann examined wind speeds at an altitude of about 4,500 feet. They found that when easterlies averaging 7 or 8 miles per hour were replaced by westerlies of the same strength, the difference of 15 mph or more correlated strongly with increased hurricane formation in the gulf and the western Caribbean. In addition, there are indications that the storms generated are more powerful if the westerlies in the Pacific are stronger. The researchers examined data for June through November, considered the Atlantic Ocean hurricane season, in each of the 48 years included in the study. They found that conditions in the Madden-Julian Oscillation were strong enough to influence hurricanes about one-third of the time. Information from earlier years is sketchier and typically comes from shipping reports. In later years, most of the data were collected by satellite.\"We originally did the analysis from 1979 to 1997 and the results are exactly the same as for the earlier period,\" Maloney said.Previously, Maloney found a link between the stronger westerlies and the formation of hurricanes over the eastern Pacific, but there was no indication then that what was happening over the Pacific related to storm formation in the Gulf of Mexico and western Atlantic Ocean.\"The topography of Mexico is high, which is why at first we just looked at the Eastern Pacific,\" Hartmann said. \"It was only later that Eric looked at the Gulf of Mexico and found the signal was just as strong, which was a surprise.\"The research was paid for by a grant from the National Science Foundation.The two plan further research into how the topography of Mexico and Central America interacts with the weather systems, and to better understand the relationship between the Madden-Julian Oscillation and hurricanes near the Americas. They also plan to look for similar links to storms forming in the central Atlantic."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_803", "content": "Liu's latest study provides concrete information about the probability of catastrophic hurricanes making landfall in the U.S. and shows that the hurricane activity of the most recent millennium has been mild, both in frequency and intensity of storms. The chances of a catastrophic hurricane hitting the U.S. Gulf Coast are about once every 300-600 years, the study shows. The findings provide a specific number range for the first time, answering what Liu calls the \"$30 billion question\" asked by insurance companies and home owners about the probability of U.S. hurricane landfalls. Liu said Hurricane Andrew, a category 4 storm, caused $30 billion in damage. Liu presented his findings Feb. 19 at a hurricane symposium that is part of the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. The 2000 meeting was held Feb. 17-22 in Washington, D.C. Liu, LSU's James J. Parsons Professor of Geography, is one of nine leading hurricane experts who spoke during the day-long symposium titled \"Frontiers in Hurricane Climate Research.\" He delivered his presentation, \"Paleotempestology: Reconstruction of Past Hurricane Landfalls from Sedimentary Proxy Records,\" during the morning session and will serve as chair of the afternoon session. Liu is also an organizer of the symposium. By examining sediment in coastal lakes and marshes along the coasts of the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean, Liu has been able to reconstruct the frequency and intensity of hurricane landfalls dating back some 5,000 years. This cutting-edge field of research is known as paleotempestology, or the science of studying storm activities of the past. It is a relatively new field of study, and Liu is taking it by storm. \"Our records of hurricanes only go back about 150 years, and that is a short time to observe these storms and to predict the probability of being hit by a catastrophic hurricane,\" Liu said. \"Hurricane Camille in 1969 is the only category 5 hurricane that hit the U.S. mainland during that time. We need to look back longer to put the present climate into perspective. If we don't look far enough back in the past, we don't know what could be in store for us in the future.\" The storm surge that accompanies a hurricane washes up onto the shoreline when a storm makes landfall. This \"storm overwash\" carries sand from the beach and dunes into coastal lakes and marshes, forming a sand layer. With each new hurricane comes a new layer of sand. By digging up the sediment and using radio-carbon dating to date the layers, Liu was able to determine the number of hurricanes that have hit the coast for the past five millennia. Liu has been performing this procedure on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico for the past 10 years, examining more than 16 sites from Florida to Texas. He has been working on the Atlantic Coast for the past two years, where he studies six sites from Virginia to Massachusetts. Although Liu's findings show that catastrophic hurricanes -- those of categories 4 and 5 -- make landfall in the U.S. about once every 300-600 years, he said the numbers are higher along the Gulf Coast than the Atlantic Coast. His findings also show that there are fluctuations in hurricane activity from one millennium to another, just as there are from one decade to another. These fluctuations are the result of varying climatic patterns that cause hurricanes to be mild and infrequent during some periods in history, and to be catastrophic during other time spans. While the 300-600-year time frame might be considered good news to some coastal residents, the bad news is that hurricane activity during the past millennium, when compared with other periods of time, has been mild and inactive, Liu said. \"People think Camille and Andrew were devastating, but we haven't seen anything yet,\" Liu said. \"If we switch back to a more active state, the U.S. could be hit a lot more frequently than we've seen in our lifetimes. There is a very distinct millennial-scale variability, and in the past 1,000 years, there has been a very low incidence of major hurricane landfalls along the Gulf Coast.\" Liu said such information is vital to coastal-development planners and insurance-risk assessors, not to mention the millions of people in America who live in coastal zones. \"Insurance companies charge us based on a probability that they came up with,\" Liu said of people living along the U.S. coastline. \"Until now, there was no empirical basis for estimating the probability for catastrophic hurricanes. Now we have numbers that are scientifically validated.\" Liu said his study was funded by both the scientific community and the insurance industry, exemplifying an unusual union between science and society. Both the Risk Prediction Initiative, housed at the Bermuda Biological Station for Research, and the National Science Foundation have funded his work. The symposium dealing with hurricanes was included at the AAAS meeting because of the increase in hurricane-induced losses of property during the past decade, Liu said. He pointed out that the 1970s and 1980s were periods with a relatively low incidence of intense hurricanes. During that time, an influx of people to coastal areas caused huge population and property increases along the U.S. coastline. When hurricane activity increased in the 1990s, there were more lives and property to be lost than ever before. Liu said these \"inter-decadal\" variations in hurricane activity can give people a false sense of security. \"When we go a long time without a hurricane, we forget the lessons we learned from storms like Camille,\" Liu said. He said the symposium will examine the new frontiers of hurricane research, such as paleotempestology, as well as the climatology of hurricanes and planning and evacuation issues. The speakers will address past and potential future changes in hurricane landfalls, the relationship between hurricane activity and the condition of the oceans and the atmosphere, the ability of meteorologists to predict hurricane landfalls and how the public responds to the risk of a hurricane. Other presenters at the symposium included researchers and scientists from the National Hurricane Center, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Bermuda Biological Station for Research, Florida State University, the University of Rhode Island and the risk-management industry. The AAAS annual meeting provides an opportunity for scientists from around the U.S. to network, discuss research topics and findings and announce major scientific discoveries."}

In addition, they found that using the past rainfall data collected from defense meteorological satellites and NASAâs Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) spacecraft could be used to increase the forecast skill even further. Their method examines the behavior of a number of different forecast models and selects those properties from each model that lead to the true rainfall as observed by the TRMM satellite in the past. These model properties are then used to predict the rainfall for 3 days into the future with remarkable success.\"Including rainfall into the multi-forecast model, or superensemble model is a unique approach,\" said Prof. T.N. Krishnamurti, the paper's lead author and a TRMM scientist at Florida State University, Tallahassee, Fla. \"Overall weâre most interested in improving the three-day rainfall forecast skills. Our research has shown that the global, as well as the regional skills, using the multi-analysis superensemble, are higher with TRMM research data.\"These forecast results are based on five experiments each during Aug. 1 to Aug. 5, 1998. The skill or accuracy was higher over all tropical regions. Scientists attribute this success to a combination of improved analyses available from the superensemble approach as well as the availability of accurate rainfall estimates over the tropics from the TRMM satellite.For years, scientists have attempted to improve the short-term forecasts in the tropics, but only minor improvements were made. Now, with research data from the NASA TRMM spacecraft, scientists will more accurately, or with greater reliability, forecast rainfall in the tropics. This is particularly important when it comes to hurricane tracks and rainfall accumulations. Experimental forecasts made by this new technique during the â99 hurricane season, for instance, correctly forecast the track of major hurricanes such as Dennis and Floyd.Scientists have a keen interest in how potential changes in the global climate might affect the associated rainfall patterns as they affect human activities. \"Making such improvements in even the short term forecasts\", says Chris Kummerow, the TRMM project Scientist, \"is important because it demonstrates that we are learning more about the behavior of rainfall within these models. Understanding rainfall patterns generated by our global climate models is an extremely difficult problem\", he said. \"Having additional information available from these weather forecast models has not only the obvious benefit of better short term forecasts, but may also help shed additional light upon the climate models.In his paper, Krishnamurti highlights the various research methods used to come to these conclusions. TRMM is NASA's first mission dedicated to observing and understanding tropical rainfall and how it affects the global climate. The TRMM spacecraft fills an enormous void in the ability to calculate world-wide precipitation because so little of the planet is covered by ground-based radars. Presently, only two percent of the area covered by TRMM is covered by ground-based radars, said Dr. Christian Kummerow, TRMM Project Scientist at NASAâs Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Md..TRMM has produced continuous data since December 1997.

{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_805", "content": "William Gray, a nationally recognized hurricane expert, and his colleagues are calling for a \"moderate\" season in 2000 with 11 named storms, seven hurricanes and three intense hurricanes predicted. While above the long-term average, the 2000 forecast calls for fewer storms than occurred in the years 1995, 1996, 1998 and 1999. The team is calling for an above-average probability of U.S. major hurricane landfall. Their record for the 1999 season was one of the best in the 16 years the seasonal forecasts have been issued. In 1999, the team retained its original forecast throughout the season, predicting 14 named storms, nine hurricanes and four major, or intense, hurricanes. At the end of the June 1-Nov. 30 season, observed totals were 12 named storms, eight hurricanes and five major hurricanes. Long-term averages based on the period 1950-1990 indicate 9.3 named storms, 5.8 hurricanes and 2.2 intense hurricanes per year. The 2000 season forecast, while closer to average than others of recent years, is still expected to exceed the average season during the relatively quiet period between 1970-94. A principal reason for the moderate storm numbers is the team's belief that the La Nina a phenomenon, present for the past two years, will reduce in strength by next season. This should weaken its enhancing effect on hurricane formation in the Atlantic Basin (comprising the North Atlantic Ocean, Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico). Gray warned, however, that indications continue to show that intense storms (with wind speeds above 110 mph) will occur. In terms of the probability of landfall, this year's forecast calls for the U.S. Atlantic Coast, including peninsular Florida, to have a 45 percent chance of being hit by one or more major storms with winds above 110 mph. The long-term (100-year) mean is 31 percent. The Gulf Coast faces a 37 percent probability of one or more landfalling major hurricanes, while the long-term Gulf Coast average is 30 percent. The chances of one or more intense storms coming ashore somewhere along the entire U.S. coast, from Brownsville to the Canadian border, is 66 percent (the long-term average is 52 percent). \"We do not foresee the number of intense storms in Saffir-Simpson categories 3-5 that we saw in the Atlantic Basin in 1995, 1996 and last year,\" Gray said. \"Of the five major hurricanes in 1999, only one--Bret--struck the U.S. coast, in a nearly uninhabited area of south Texas. \"Floyd, another category 4 storm, lashed the East Coast from Florida north before coming ashore as a strong category 2 hurricane in North Carolina, bringing unprecedented amounts of rainfall.\" Gray, professor of atmospheric sciences at Colorado State, and his colleagues believe the 2000 season will start earlier than the seasons of 1998 and 1999. Until four hurricanes formed during a brief period in the last third of August of this year, only one tropical storm (Arlene) had occurred in the first two-plus months of the 1999 season. \"Relatively moderate seasons frequently start earlier, which is why we think we'll see more storms earlier in the summer of 2000,\" Gray said. \"In addition, 2000 will be one of these seasons in which equatorial stratospheric winds known as the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation are easterly, which tends to inhibit storm formation at lower latitudes.\" Contributing to the anticipated moderate season this year are a number of atmospheric and oceanic phenomena that Gray calls \"climate signals.\" Those include: *La Ni a, a mass of cold water in the eastern equatorial Pacific. La Ni a was powerful this year and produced anomalous upper tropospheric easterly winds over the Caribbean and tropical Atlantic, a condition that acted to enhance hurricane formation. Next year, while the mass of water will likely remain cold, Gray and his colleagues expect the temperature to moderate. They do not anticipate an El Ni o condition developing. *A reversal of the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation, which consists of stratospheric, equatorial east-west winds blowing 16 to 35 kilometers above the earth's surface. These winds typically blow for 12-16 months from the east and then reverse and blow the same length of time from the west with a total period of about 26 to 30 months, or roughly two years. The shift due next season will produce easterly winds, which tend to interfere with the development of easterly (barometric) waves coming off the coast of Africa. *Continued warm North Atlantic sea surface temperatures. While these temperatures have moderated slightly during the last year, they indicate that the Atlantic Ocean thermohaline circulation system, or Atlantic conveyor belt, continues strong. A strong Atlantic conveyor belt, Gray and others believe, contributes to the formation of greater numbers of major or intense (Saffir-Simpson category 3-5) storms. This increases the probability of major hurricane landfall on the U.S. East Coast and in the Caribbean. \"I think 2000 will continue the new era of increased Atlantic conveyor belt strength and hence of the probability of more intense hurricanes,\" Gray said. \"Following a period of suppressed major hurricane activity from 1970 to 1994, it is expected that 2000 will continue the upward trend established in 1995.\" The years 1995-99 were the most-active five consecutive years of hurricane activity on record in the Atlantic Basin, yielding 65 named storms, 41 hurricanes and 20 major hurricanes. By contrast, the numbers of hurricanes and typhoons in the Pacific Ocean are lower, which Gray takes as an indication that the upward trend in Atlantic storms should not be interpreted as being the result of human-induced global warming. Gray and co-authors Chris Landsea, Paul Mielke, Kenneth Berry, with the assistance of Todd Kimberlain, Eric Blake and Bill Thorson, use a variety of climatic factors in their forecasts. In addition to stratospheric winds, continuing warm North Atlantic sea surface temperatures and continuing La NiÃ±a conditions, they look at a ridge of barometric high pressure called the Azores High, warmer sea-surface temperatures throughout the Atlantic, two measures of west African rainfall and mid-latitude oceanic wind patterns in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. ###Note to editors: The complete hurricane forecast and related research and press releases are available on the World Wide Web at:"}

{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_807", "content": "\"Following Hurricane Floyd, record-breaking rains continued to soak the area, washing mountains of sediment and waste into the water system.  Now rivers and tributaries along the Atlantic are choked and major ecological changes are happening,\" said Gene Feldman, of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, MD.     \"Periodically, levels of dissolved oxygen in the water have dropped dramatically as organic matter decomposes, and aquatic life has been threatened in dozens of estuaries and peripheral habitats, commonly referred to as 'dead zones.'  The current changes in the area may have lasting repercussions for hundreds of thousands of people,\" he said.     Scientists are studying Hurricane Floyd's effect on algae blooms and phytoplankton, important links in the regional marine food chain.  Their data also will help them understand how the hurricane's aftermath may affect the fragile environment in the coming months.     Using data from NASA's Earth-orbiting Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor  (SeaWiFS) and an airborne laser instrument, scientists from two National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) centers can monitor algae growth over large regions, including Pamlico Sound between the North Carolina mainland and the Outer Banks.     According to Pat Tester, a NOAA scientist at the Center for Coastal Fisheries and Habitat Research, Beaufort, NC, fertilizer and other nutrients that flowed down the storm flooded rivers in eastern North Carolina are feeding the algae or phytoplankton in the sounds.     \"One question is what happens to the aquatic activity in the sounds when this algae dies and begins to starve the waters of oxygen,\" Tester said.  \"The long-term observations provided by the NASA technology will help us monitor the phytoplankton in the water.     \"The NASA technology improves our ability to monitor these important fishery areas by covering larger areas than direct sampling from boats can, and by providing this information for weeks or months.\"     Tester's team is coordinating sampling missions from small boats on the waterways with flights by a NOAA Twin-Otter aircraft carrying the NASA laser and observations from the SeaWiFS spacecraft.  \"This approach is providing a three-tier look at the area from space, air and sea,\" she said.     The laser system, the Airborne Oceanographic Lidar from Goddard's Wallops Flight Facility, Wallops Island, VA, transmits a green light pulse into the water, where the light is absorbed by the phytoplankton.  A receiver on the aircraft detects the green light reflected from the water's surface and red light that is emitted by the chlorophyll pigment in the algae.     The SeaWiFS instrument measures changes in water color that indicate where concentrations of phytoplankton are located.     NOAA's Coastal Services Center, Charleston, SC, is also taking part in the research.

{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_808", "content": "Now, a University of Miami Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science professor has identified the probable cause of those sudden intensifications and, perhaps more importantly, mapped some of the hot spots where this season's hurricanes are likely to strengthen dramatically just before landfall. The cause, UM associate professor of Meteorology and Physical Oceanography Lynn K. \"Nick\" Shay said, are \"warm core rings,\" where warm water extends down to a depth of 100 meters or more. The discovery, which is the result of a joint effort between Shay and Peter Black of NOAA's Hurricane Research Division, could save lives and millions of dollars spent on unnecessary evacuations by helping more accurately predict how powerful a storm will be when it strikes land. \"This is the heat. This is the energy source,\" Shay said. \"It's like a big fuel-injector in the middle of the ocean.\" Warm ocean temperatures fuel hurricanes. Normally, though, surface temperatures of 26 degrees centigrade or higher only extend down about 30 to 40 meters. A passing storm draws some energy from the warm water as it passes, but it also stirs it, mixing it with cooler water from below and lowering the temperature of the surface water. The now-cooler surface water then provides less energy for the storm, keeping it from intensifying much further. In a warm core ring, however, the warm water goes much deeper. It doesn't cool that much when a storm passes because it doesn't mix with cooler water from below. A hurricane passing over one of the rings, which are 180 to 220 kilometers in diameter, gets a rich, deep source of energy that, coupled with the right atmospheric conditions, can suddenly turbo-charge a hurricane and turn a minimal storm into a monster. \"Ultimately,\" Shay said, \"what we are aiming for is to be able to say that when it encounters this ring, you may be looking at a category four or five storm.\" A warm core ring is forming right now in the north Gulf in a position to affect passing hurricanes this season. Like the ones discovered before it, the ring was predictable. The rings develop every 11 to 14 months at the top of a warm-water current that loops up into the Gulf of Mexico from the Caribbean Sea. Then, typically, they drift westward at one to four kilometers per day over a period of several months until they break up along the Mexico or Texas coast. Another one forms in the northern Atlantic, off the coast of Maine. Shay and Black plan to map a detailed three-dimensional grid of the ring in the Gulf. They also are using historical hurricane tracking information to determine whether warm core rings could account for the sudden intensification of past storms."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_809", "content": "A hurricane's passage over a warm ocean eddy or current has been linked to a marked intensification of hurricane winds. Researchers at the Colorado Center for Astrodynamics Research in CU-Boulder's College of Engineering and Applied Science have been analyzing the relationship between warm ocean features and hurricane intensification using altimeter data from the TOPEX/POSEIDON and ERS-2 Earth-orbiting satellites. These remote sensing satellites, which use a technique that measures the travel time of a microwave pulse reflected off the ocean's surface, help to detect the location of warm eddies and currents in real time, and thus are the latest tool in use by hurricane forecasters. Working with Gustavo Goni at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory, CCAR researchers under the direction of aerospace engineering professor George Born, are using the data to assist forecasters in predicting which storms are likely to hit coastal areas the hardest. While the ability to forecast a hurricane's path is relatively advanced, predicting intensity and storm surge -- information that could help determine evacuation areas and other safety measures -- has lagged behind because of insufficient data. A hurricane is born when the right atmospheric conditions are combined with sea surface temperatures exceeding 26 degrees C (79 degrees F), according to CCAR research assistant Suzanna Barth. Warm air rises off the surface of the water, creating an atmospheric low-pressure cell which, if near the equator, produces winds that bend poleward as a result of the earth's rotation. When a hurricane is then driven by high-altitude winds on a path over other warm water features, the additional heat may cause the storm to intensify. \"Think of it as a steam engine -- the more heat that's put into it, the faster it's going to run,\" said associate research professor Robert Leben.

Three more will open within the next year in Escambia, Miami-Dade and St. Johns counties, and a fifth tentatively is slated for Pinellas County.\tThe Shimberg Center is based in UF's M.E. Rinker Sr. School of Building Construction, and the project is funded by the state Department of Insurance.\tThe 3,126-square-foot buildings, designed to look like a typical single-family home, are capable of withstanding winds of at least 110 mph, or nearly category 3 strength. Yet some components can withstand winds much stronger than that, Stroh said.\tFor example, the garage doors of the training centers are reinforced by a system that meets impact and pressure requirements for winds of up to 180 mph. A typical garage door, without similar reinforcement, resists winds of between 70 mph and 110 mph.\tAnother feature of the centers is an insulated, reinforced concrete form wall system that meets the wind-load and impact resistance requirements of the South Florida Building Code, the most stringent in the state, Stroh said.\tThe roofs of the one-story  training centers are held down by metal strapping, and a spray adhesive is applied to the roof sheathing to improve the wind resistance.\t\"You would almost have to lift the house off the ground before the roof blows away,\" Stroh said.\tWhile some features, such as the wall system, are applicable only to new construction, visitors may borrow some ideas to improve the wind resistance of their current homes. For instance, three impact-resistant shutter systems on display can be installed on existing homes, Stroh said.\tThe cost of making a home more wind-resistant is worth the investment, said Frank Lepore, a National Hurricane Center spokesman. Property damage costs from hurricanes total about $4.5 billion in the United States each year, he said. \t\"If you were to compare out-of-pocket costs to damages caused by a hurricane, you would still come out ahead,\" Lepore said. \"It's worth the additional money to prevent damage to the structure.\"\tEach training center includes its own classroom complete with audiovisual equipment that will accommodate classes of 40 attendees. Transparent panels cover cut-away sections of the wall and ceiling to reveal the internal construction and structural connections.\tThe participating counties have agreed to pay all future maintenance and operating costs and ensure that the centers are used for training purposes. The Fort Pierce training center is free and open to the public, as the other centers will be upon completion."}

Additional outreach efforts include Clemson's support of a demonstration site in Charleston and the hiring of a full-time coastal hazards specialist to work directly with homeowners, builders, engineers and architects on improved construction techniques and mitigation of hazards such as hurricanes, floods and earthquakes. Clemson President Constantine W. \"Deno\" Curris said, \"As a land-grant university, Clemson's role is not just to create new knowledge through research, but also to take the results of research directly to the people. These projects are perfect examples of how Clemson's tripartite mission of teaching, research and outreach can serve the needs of the state.\" The how-to guide's core recommendations include creating wind-resistant exterior envelopes for homes, better-connected roofing systems and a \"unitized\" home structure in which major components are well connected to other components from the roof all the way through the foundation. The guide--\"What homeowners can do to make their homes stronger against high winds\"--will be available through Clemson Extension offices and online at www.clemson.edu . \"We wanted to develop dirt-cheap things people could do to make their homes stronger and more wind resistant,\" said Clemson associate civil engineering professor Tim Reinhold. Clemson has one of the nation's top laboratories for testing the effects of wind on low-rise structures such as homes and schools. Meanwhile, full-time coastal hazards specialist Elizabeth Judge will help homeowners, builders, architects and designers apply the lessons learned through cutting-edge research at Clemson and elsewhere. The agent, one of the few nationwide to specialize in hazards such as wind, earthquake and flood, is co-funded by the S.C. Sea Grant Consortium and Clemson's Cooperative Extension Service. Ultimately, homeowners will be able to see wind solutions in action at 113 Calhoun Street, a 125-year-old house in Charleston that serves as a Community Sustainability Center to demonstrate how housing can be built to better survive the forces of nature while being kinder to the environment. The 113 Calhoun Street Foundation, a partnership of the S.C. Sea Grant Consortium, the Clemson University Cooperative Extension Service and the city of Charleston, will demonstrate how people can use off-the-shelf, economically feasible materials and techniques to make houses safer from natural disasters such as hurricanes. The center, which will serve as the home office for Judge, is tentatively set to open in February. The wood frame home survived Hurricane Hugo in 1989, many additional hurricanes, at least one fire and, in 1886, the most severe earthquake ever recorded east of the Mississippi. That it's a survivor makes it an appropriate choice for a project designed to show builders, contractors and homeowners how to use construction techniques and materials to better protect a house from storm wind and consequent water damage, according to Bob Bacon, Sea Grant Extension program leader. Bacon heads the technical committee of architects, engineers and builders who are designing and executing 113 Calhoun's renovation and retrofit. \"This project is about protecting lives, property and the economy when natural disasters occur,\" he said."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_813", "content": "But there also may be some good news--Gray's predictions for this yearcalled for four major storms, and four have already occurred. The hurricaneseason officially runs from June 1 though Nov. 30, but the real heart of theseason is from mid-August through October.        Gray, who has been issuing hurricane forecasts for more than a decade,predicted an active year in 1999, with 14 named storms, nine hurricanes and fourintense hurricanes. As of today, just past the halfway mark for the season,seven named storms, five hurricanes and four intense hurricanes have formed. Thelong-term average for a season is 9.3 tropical storms, 5.8 hurricanes and 2.2intense hurricanes each year, based on an analysis of 1950-1990 storm activity.       \"Our forecast for this season is based on the future being like thepast,\" Gray said. \"Similar atmospheric and ocean patterns as this year occurredin 1950, 1955, 1961, 1964 and 1995. All these were very active seasons. If wedon't get an active year in 1999, it means the atmosphere for some strangereason has stopped behaving as it has in the past. We don't expect that tohappen.\"         As part of their research, Gray and his team also forecast theprobability of hurricane landfall along the U.S. coastline. For 1999 the teamhas predicted a roughly 54 percent chance that one or more intense storms (withwind speeds of 110 mph or above) will make landfall along the U.S. East Coast,including Florida. The Gulf Coast has an approximately 40 percent chance thatone or more intense storms will make landfall. For the Caribbean and Bahamasland areas, the rough probability of one or more major storm landfalls is 72percent and for Mexico the probability is 28 percent, according to the landfallforecast.        To date, Hurricanes Dennis and Floyd are the only storms to makelandfall along the U.S. Coast.         Hurricanes are rated on the Saffir/Simpson intensity scale, which rangesfrom 1-5. The scale reflects a hurricane's wind- and ocean-surge intensity.Hurricanes of Category 3 or higher are considered intense storms and havemaximum sustained winds of 110 miles per hour or greater.        To issue his seasonal forecasts, Gray and his team rely on \"climatesignals,\" or measures of the global oceanic and atmospheric circulation system.These signals have remained both consistent throughout the year and, in all butone case, are favorable for hurricane formation. Factors promoting hurricane formation include:         The period from 1995-98 was the most active, four consecutive years ofhurricane activity on record, yielding 53 named storms, 33 hurricanes and 15major hurricanes. This and certain other climate signals suggest to Gray and hisassociates that a period of more major hurricane activity and more intense-stormlandfalls along the East Coast and in the Caribbean Basin is now underway.        The periods 1900-25 and 1970-94 were relatively quiescent in terms ofmajor hurricane activity, Gray said, while seasons from the early 1930s throughthe late 1960s generally were more active, with more intense storms lashing theAtlantic coast. He attributes this to a phenomenon called the Atlantic Oceanthermohaline circulation system, or Atlantic conveyor belt, which moves watersnorth from the vicinity of the Caribbean to an area east of Greenland. There,the current sinks to deep levels, moves south and flows into the South AtlanticOcean and beyond.         Warm water and high salinity in the conveyor belt strengthen it,producing more active hurricane seasons and more major landfalling storms alongthe eastern seaboard, Gray said.         \"This ocean circulation, a northbound current that sinks and then movessouthbound, tends to go through decades-long changes,\" Gray said. \"Ourinterpretation of climate data suggests that the Atlantic conveyor belt becamestronger between 1994 and 1995, and this has led to more major storms since thattime.\"          The seasonal forecast, now in its 16th year, is prepared by Gray andco-authors Chris Landsea, Paul Mielke, Kenneth Berry and other projectcolleagues."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_814", "content": "Hugo's 1989 trek through the state damaged some 4.5 million acres of timberland in 23 South Carolina counties. After the hurricane, Gresham and other ecologists identified research sites in four South Carolina forests to track the recovery process over time. These sites have been set aside as permanent research areas through a grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. They will remain undisturbed by any future developments and are being used to document what happens to forests in the aftermath of major hurricane damage. Gresham is based at the Clemson's Belle W. Baruch Institute of Coastal Ecology and Forest Science in Georgetown, a public service research and education center that focuses on forests, wildlife and the environment. Every three years since 1993, he and other scientists have visited the research sites to measure the plant life and woody debris left behind, then inventory the types of trees in the study plots. The study sites are located in the Hobcaw Forest at the Baruch Institute, the Francis Marion National Forest near McClellanville, the Bidler Forest near Holly Hill and the Congaree Forest near Columbia. \"Nature abhors a vacuum,\" Gresham said. \"Within 10 years, we have seen significant recovery-- back to a fully functional, productive forest with a lot of habitat for wildlife. The trees that had their tops broken off by Hugo have re-formed crowns so the canopy has returned. We've also seen a ten-fold increase in the number of new trees filling in open spaces.\" Called \"advance regeneration,\" these new trees are coming from seeds dropped into open spaces left when older trees were felled by the hurricane's reported 100-plus mile-per-hour winds and by the rapid growth of seedlings released by the creation of open spaces. A major change Gresham and other scientists have noted is that the new growth is by the \"pioneer\" species of pine, sweet gum and black gum instead of the \"climax\" species of oak or tupelo. But the mix of species is expected to change over time as the saplings compete for light and nutrients and slower growing species outlast the faster growing ones. \"I've had to open my mind and think in a different time frame,\" Gresham said. \"We're all accustomed to turning on a computer and 'whoom' you've got what you need right then. \"But forest processes work on a longer time scale. Ten years is a very short time frame in a tree's life. A loblolly pine has a life span of 130 years and there are live oaks down here that are a couple of hundred years old. If we stick around for another 100 years, we might see a very similar forest to what was here before Hugo.\" Another observation that has emerged from the study is that disturbance, whether from a hurricane or from a single tree dying, is a natural part of forest dynamics. \"It's not rare or unnatural, it's just a normal part of nature's process and the forest's development,\" Gresham said. The only remaining evidence of Hugo today is the debris of fallen trees and logs that now provide habitat for wildlife and support the growth of other plants by releasing nutrients into the soil. Three species of trees weathered the hurricane with less damage than others, Gresham said. Not surprisingly, they are the trees most closely identified with the Lowcountry's coastal plain: live oak, cypress and long leaf pine. These are the species that are most likely to survive when hurricanes hit. The live oak is low and squat, with wood as hard as steel, so it keeps its head down and lets others take the brunt of the winds, Gresham said. The cypress has a deciduous needle, so Hugo's first gusts of wind in September blew off the needles and then had less resistance to cause further damage. The long leaf pine is generally not as tall as the loblolly pine so was less likely to be damaged by the wind, although taller longleaf pines proved to be just as susceptible as other tall trees. An inventory at the research sites will be conducted again in 2000 and 2003. \"I can't wait to read the next chapter and see how the species composition is changing and how the species are growing,\" Gresham said. This research is funded through the South Carolina Agriculture and Forestry Research System based at Clemson, and is being conducted in cooperation with the National Audubon Society, the U.S. Forest Service, National Park Service and the University of Georgia."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_815", "content": "CLEMSON, S.C.-- Engineers--led by teams from Clemson University--are scrambling to deploy four mobile data-acquisition platforms squarely in the path of oncoming Hurricane Floyd. The \"wind towers\" will provide an accurate ground-level picture of the wind speed and direction.  Clemson researchers can then use that data to help improve building codes for coastal areas. \"We hope to have our platforms right in the heart of the hurricane when it comes, getting details as they happen, where they're happening,\" said Scott Schiff, an associate professor in civil engineering at Clemson. Research leader on the projects is Tim Reinhold, also an associate professor of civil engineering at Clemson. Each steel-reinforced platform, which weighs up to 4,500 pounds, is specifically designed to withstand hurricane-force winds and features special securing legs. The teams--and towers--were initially stationed in South Florida on a project to measure how hurricane-force winds affect houses retrofitted for the storms. That initiative, called the Florida Coastal Monitoring Project, is sponsored by the Florida Department of Community Affairs and includes the University of Florida and Florida International University . But the teams re-deployed the wind towers toward the Carolinas when Floyd continued tracking north. At rest, each wind tower looks like a giant spider on its back, with legs clutched to its stomach.  When fully deployed, the trailer's central tower extends 33 feet into the air while other out-rigger \"legs\" will extend downward to form a giant X. The points of that X will then literally be screwed into the ground with 2.5-foot earth screws. The platforms can be fully extended and secured in place in as little as 20 minutes. Most platforms will feature three anemometers specifically designed to operate in high-wind storms.  The devices will measure wind speed at heights of 33 feet, a standard reference height, and 15 feet, the height of a typical single-story home.  That information will then be relayed along steel-reinforced cables to an onboard computer housed in a reinforced box.  The equipment will be powered by generator for the first nine hours, with batteries providing an additional 19 hours of operating time. The approximately $100,000 project is funded with monies from Clemson University, the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory, the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Florida Department of Community Affairs. \"This gives us one of our first chances to get the high-resolution wind-speed data - near the ground, close to where a storm passes - that we need in order to develop design bases for hurricane-resistant homes,\" said James K. Nelson Jr., chair of Clemson's civil engineering department. Typical airport anemometers simply aren't designed to collect this type of information, said Nelson. Hurricane-hunting aircraft, meanwhile, only measure wind speed at considerable altitude and usually do not make measurements over land. Clemson's Wind Load Test Facility is one of the nation's top laboratories for testing the effects of wind on low-rise structures such as homes and schools."}

We've done everything possible to protect the valuable national assets we have at KSC. Here's an update on preparations for the storm and other information of interest. OverviewOver the weekend, KSC workers got a head start on implementation of the Center's standard hurricane preparedness plan.  By Monday night, we completed all possible steps to protect Space Shuttle flight hardware, payloads, equipment and facilities. We released KSC employees from work late Monday to allow adequate time for personal hurricane preparation. Employees will remain on administrative leave through Wednesday. KSC's elevation is approximately nine feet, so we are concerned about both wind damage and water intrusion in the event of a storm surge. Protecting the Space Shuttle FleetSpace Shuttle Orbiters Discovery, Endeavour and Columbia remain in Orbiter Processing Facility Bays 1, 2 and 3 respectively. The Orbiter Processing Facility is constructed of concrete and steel and was designed to withstand winds of 105 mph. We are storing Orbiter Atlantis in the landmark Vehicle Assembly Building, in High Bay 2. The Vehicle Assembly Building is constructed of concrete and steel and was designed to withstand winds of 125 mph.Other payload and flight hardware support facilities can endure winds of 110 mph. Launch pads and the Payload Hazardous Servicing Facility can withstand 125-mph winds.On Monday, KSC workers closed the payload bay doors on all orbiters, and retracted the landing gear as part of standard hurricane protection efforts. The orbiters are now resting in their harnesses approximately 10 feet off the ground.We transported 11 solid rocket booster segments by rail Tallahassee, FL, by railroad; they can be moved further west if necessary. It would not have been logistically feasible to move the Orbiters from KSC. It takes a few days to mate an orbiter to the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft and fly it out of the area. The orbiters are in the safest location possible when not on orbit.Protecting Other Facilities at KSCKSC workers raised Shuttle and payload test above floor level to avert flood damage. The Rotating Service Structures at Launch Pads 39A and 39B were rotated back to the Fixed Service Structures to maximize their protection from high winds.In the Space Station Processing Facility, the International Space Station flight hardware is already elevated in test stands; KSC employees also covered the hardware. In addition to protecting the orbiters and payloads within the facilities, KSC employees secured the buildings themselves. This includes boarding windows, removing or tying down antennas, and sandbagging doors. Hardware for the next five Space Station flights are at KSC and has been protected. Test equipment is also being elevated and covered. Hardware and Facilities for the Next Shuttle MissionsThe Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) payload will ride out the storm in the Space Station Processing Facility high bay inside the payload canister with the doors closed. In the Payload Hazardous Servicing Facility, the Hubble Space Telescope flight elements for Space Shuttle Mission STS-103 have been bagged and the test equipment covered.Who's Left at KSC?Rideout crews totaling about 120 individuals have been stationed throughout KSC. As of 4:00 pm EDT on Sept. 14 this crew will have been scaled back to approximately 80 people who will move to the Launch Control Center, Space Station Processing Facility, and the astronaut quarters, all of which can sustain 110-mph winds and are not in danger of flooding. Shortly thereafter, all those wishing to leave will have left, and KSC will have been locked down completely with no one entering or exiting the facility.What About Launch Facilities at Cape Canaveral?There are no NASA rockets or payloads on the launch pads. The Air Force does have a Delta and a Titan lashed down to the pad, and there are two commercial Atlases at the pad. Other InformationNASA budgets $12 million per year for hurricane preparedness at KSC.The Orbiters are not insured; the government is a self insurer. If something were to happen to an Orbiter, NASA would ask Congress to appropriate funds for replacement, as we after the Challenger accident.The orbiters have never sustained any hurricane damage.Approximately 13,000 contractors and NASA employees work at KSC."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_817", "content": "The study also determined that a consequence of El NiÃ±o is less hurricane development in the Atlantic Ocean than when El NiÃ±o is not present.A statistical analysis by Wilson of hurricanes that developed in the Atlantic Ocean, Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea between 1950 and 1998 found that when El NiÃ±o  was present, the number of intense hurricanes in a season has never risen above three.  When El NiÃ±o was not present, the number of intense hurricanes in a season rose to as high as seven. On average, El NiÃ±o-related seasons experience about one intense hurricane, the study found, while non-El NiÃ±o-related seasons experience about three. In the last 50 years, 14 out of 15 non-El NiÃ±o-related seasons had two or more hurricanes. Wilson's findings will be published in an upcoming issue of the Geophysical Research Letters, a journal of the American Geophysical Union.\"My goal with this research was to show it is quite simple to predict the severity of a hurricane season,\" Wilson said. \"All you need to know is that you are under the influence of an El NiÃ±o.\"I anticipate that 1999 will be a busy hurricane season, because we're in a non-El NiÃ±o-related year. The ocean temperatures are there. And the right winds are occurring,\" Wilson said.\"El NiÃ±o is a natural part of the climate system, not a beast in and of itself,\" he said. \"It is an interaction between the ocean and the atmosphere that has global consequences.  One of the consequences of El NiÃ±o is less hurricane development.\"By knowing that intense storms are likely to occur, coastal areas can prepare,\" Wilson said. \"We need to be aware that we have been in an era, from the mid-1960s to the early 1990s, when we have had little hurricane activity. During that time more and more people have moved to coastal areas, so there is a generation that has been lulled into a false sense of security because they are not familiar with the destructive power of hurricanes. Hopefully, this research can act as a warning.\"The name El NiÃ±o, Spanish for \"boy Christ child,\" originally was used by local fishermen to describe a warming of the Pacific Ocean off Peru and Ecuador. The warming occurs annually, but the fishermen noticed in some years it intensified around Christmas, creating unusual storms and the destruction of marine life in the region.El NiÃ±o events occur about every three to seven years. Just as a clock pendulum swings between two extremes, ocean conditions vary between El NiÃ±o (warm water events), La NiÃ±a (cold water events), and interlude conditions. Scientists refer to this weather pattern as the \"El NiÃ±o-Southern Oscillation.\" \tThe hurricane season begins June 1, peaks around September 10 and ends November 30, although the bulk of major hurricanes occurs between mid-August and mid-October of each year.- 30 -"}

Although Bonnie was downgraded to a tropical storm by the time it reached the With a new hurricane season under way, the Johns Hopkins team, led by Although its exterior resembles that of a  two-story tract house, this building, owned by the town of Southern Shores, actually operates as a community center. High-tech equipment inside and outside can record weather conditions, wind  pressure on the building and movement of the structure itself. Data from these sensors is collected inside the house by a computer that can relay the information by modem to the university's Baltimore campus. As a  result, the engineers do not need to be on the premises when a dangerous storm strikes. \"This structure was built to demonstrate a wind-resistant construction design,\" says Jones. \"I think the odds are better than even that it would survive a fairly severe blow, such as a hurricane, but not necessarily without damage.\"  The system was activated in October 1997. Since then, the Johns Hopkins team has collected more than 2,000 data sets, including readings from a \"northeaster\" storm in February 1998 and from Bonnie in August 1998. Jones and Porterfield presented a paper describing the project and providing preliminary data from Bonnie during the 10th International Conference on Wind Engineering, held recently in Copenhagen, Denmark.  Their research is important because hurricanes can deal a devastating blow to people and property. Even though the 1998 season was relatively mild, federal officials estimated that Bonnie and other storms caused about $6.5 billion in damage. Hurricane Andrew, which struck South Florida in 1992, killed dozens of  people, destroyed more than 100,000 homes and caused about $25 billion in damage. Changes in construction methods and materials could help reduce the property loss in future storms. But builders and regulators need scientific data to help them determine how best to resist the power of hurricane-force winds. Readings from the \"wired\" house in Southern Shores could provide such clues.  The building, called the Kern P. Pitts Center, is located about a quarter-mile west of the Atlantic Ocean in a region that is commonly in the path of hurricanes and tropical storms. Its construction was initiated by the nonprofit Blue Sky Foundation to test how sections made of wood frame, steel beams and concrete would hold up in severe weather. During its construction in 1997,  Johns Hopkins engineers were permitted to install 13 pressure gauges in the walls and roof, 20 strain gauges on the studs and rafters, an ultrasonic anemometer to measure wind speed in three directions and rooftop equipment to measure rainfall, temperature and barometric pressure."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_819", "content": "For the first time, Gray and his associates have issued probability predictions of hurricanes occurring in the vicinity or making landfall in the Caribbean Basin-Bahamas or on the east coast of Mexico. \"We expect this year to be an active season, comparable to the ones in 1996 and 1998, but less busy than the extreme season of 1995,\" Gray said.Last year's season saw 14 tropical storms, 10 hurricanes and three intense hurricanes. By comparison, a 1950-1990 baseline has indicated an average of 9.3 tropical storms, 5.8 hurricanes and 2.2 intense hurricanes annually. The team believes there is a 50 to 75 percent higher probability that a storm will come ashore in the Caribbean or along Mexico's east coast this year compared with the average per-year probability for the past century.Meanwhile, there is an approximately 72 percent chance that one or more major hurricanes (Saffir-Simpson 3-5) will strike the U.S. coastline between Brownsville, Texas, and the Canadian border, or 44 percent above the 100-year average. Landfall probabilities for the U.S. East Coast, including the Florida peninsula, are about 54 percent for one or more major hurricanes, or 74 percent above the 100-year average, and about 40 percent for one or more major hurricanes making landfall on the Gulf Coast from the Florida panhandle west to Brownsville (33 percent above the long-term average.) Predictions made in December 1998 have remained the same for the April 7 and current updates, the first time since 1992 that numbers have not changed based on new data. \"The climate signals we saw in December and early April remain the same, indicating that we're likely to see activity quite a bit above the average season,\" Gray said. \"We don't see anything in the new information we have through the month of May that would cause us to alter our forecast.\" In fact, Gray said, two climate signals have strengthened his belief that this will be an active season.\"The Atlantic Ocean looks slightly more conducive to hurricane formation as sea surface temperatures have risen and, we believe, will continue to rise,\" he said. In addition, \"the West Coast from southern Canada to Baja California has unusually cold sea surface temperatures. During similar episodes we've had very active hurricane seasons,\" Gray said.The phenomenon is not necessarily related to La NiÃ±a, an upwelling of cold water limited to the equatorial Pacific. However, La NiÃ±a also contributes to Atlantic Basin hurricane formation and is expected to remain cool through the entire June 1-Nov. 30 hurricane season.Other factors promoting hurricane formation are westerly stratospheric winds, called the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation, that exist high in the atmosphere over the earth's equatorial regions and reverse themselves about every two years. When these stratospheric winds blow from the west, as they are doing in 1999, an enhancing effect on hurricane activity, especially major hurricanes, occurs.In addition, a ridge of barometric high pressure called the Azores High is measuring below average. The Azores High has an enhancing influence on hurricane activity, as does below-average Caribbean Basin sea-level pressure for August and September 1999.The forecast, now in its 16th year, is prepared by Gray and co-authors Chris Landsea, Paul Mielke, Kenneth Berry and other project colleagues.Gray believes that signals from the Atlantic, coupled with recent strong hurricane activity, indicate a new era of storm formation. Increasing North Atlantic sea surface temperatures and salinity suggest that changes observed since 1995 mean the continuance of a strong Atlantic Ocean conveyor belt circulation, bringing with it the chance for more intense hurricanes along the Atlantic coast and in the Caribbean. This enhanced period could continue for two or more decades, Gray believes.While the Atlantic conveyor belt affects the Eastern Seaboard, this year could see more activity at low latitudes from easterly waves progressing out of Africa.\"That could mean more low-latitude storms (from the equator to about 25 degrees north) this year and storms with long tracks, which tend to become more intense ones,\" Gray said. \"They can affect the Caribbean, but as they move west they tend to curve to the north and could affect the Gulf Coast.\"With this cold water along the Pacific, historically we tend to have lots of landfalling storms along the entire coast.\""}

But the scene will become a reality this summer, when engineering professors and students from three universities, including the University of Florida, launch a project to learn more about how hurricane-force winds affect houses.\tThe goal of the Florida Coastal Monitoring Program is to measure wind speeds, forces and pressures on houses retrofitted for hurricane preparedness. Researchers want to learn how effective the retrofits were, how to design more hurricane-worthy homes and whether building codes are up to snuff. They also want to gather information about low-altitude wind speeds and directions in hurricanes, data that is largely unavailable today, they say.\tClemson University in Clemson, S.C., is leading the project, with UF and Florida International University participating. Tim Reinhold, a Clemson associate professor of civil engineering, said the research may shed light on what has become a hotly contested issue.\t\"After a hurricane strikes, wind speeds tend to get exaggerated and many people believe the storm was so strong damage was inevitable,\" he said. \"Others will say the damage was a result of shoddy construction. And then there are people who say the codes just weren't stringent enough.\t\"Who is right? Right now, there's so little data as to how strong the winds were and how strong the houses were built, anybody can put up as much smoke as they want to.\"\tThe researchers currently are outfitting 10 homes in South Florida with brackets, wiring and other equipment in preparation for the start of the June 1 - Nov. 30 hurricane season. The homes, plus 10 more in the Florida Panhandle to be outfitted later this summer, are receiving hurricane retrofits as part of the Florida Department of Community Affairs' Residential Coastal Mitigation Program. The program, launched after Hurricane Andrew in 1992, provides assistance to homeowners to retrofit homes against wind or water damage. Homeowners agreed to participate in exchange for $8,000 to $12,000 in retrofits.\tKurt Gurley, a UF assistant professor of civil engineering, said researchers will track hurricanes, then work with meteorologists to determine the most likely landfall.\tWhen a hurricane appears about two days away from southeast Florida or the Panhandle, two teams of researchers will load up equipment in vans based in Gainesville, then deliver and install it in the prepared houses in the hurricane's path, Gurley said.\tThe equipment includes instruments that measure wind speed, direction and pressure and computers that collect and interpret the data for each home. As many as 20 Frisbee-sized discs placed on the homes' roofs will hold many of the instruments, he said. \"They're going to tell us how strongly the wind pushes and pulls on the home,\" he said.\tShortly before the hurricane strikes, when researchers have a more definite idea where it will make landfall, they plan to deploy at least one large trailer with several monitoring instruments directly in the storm's path. \"We'll instrument the houses, and as we learn more about where the storm is going we'll put the trailer in place,\" Reinhold said.\tReinhold and Gurley said little is known about hurricane wind speeds and forces at altitudes of below 30 meters, despite the impact these winds have on houses or other small structures. They also said that, despite evidence that the gust structure of the winds affects wind loads and influences hurricane damage, there also is little information about exactly how the effects may differ from other types of storms. \"What our project does is get at some of that science to provide a baseline of what's going on,\" Reinhold said.\tThe Florida Department of Community Affairs is funding the project with grants totaling about $560,000, much of it going for the purchase of the vans and monitoring equipment, Reinhold said. Given the vulnerability of today's structures to hurricane-force winds, it should be money well spent, he and Gurley said.\t\"People just seem to accept wind damage as something that happens -- they don't realize there's things that can be done,\" Gurley said. \"Even people in very high-risk areas like the Keys can do things to protect their property.\""}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_821", "content": "\"We had precisely the right equipment, in the right place, and at the right time, to monitor the changeover from a steady magma flow to one that was not steady but cyclical,\" says Dr. Barry Voight, professor of geosciences at Penn State and a senior scientist appointed by the British Geological Survey to work at the Montserrat Volcano Observatory. \"No one before had documented these cyclic events nearly so well, or had monitored the additional background data necessary to understand the mechanisms behind them.\"In today's (Feb. 19) issue of the journal Science, the researchers note that their analysis of the Soufriere Hills Volcano, Montserrat, British West Indies, is applicable to other andesite volcanos, the predominant type of explosive volcano worldwide. The researchers monitored the seismic and deformation behavior of the mountain in real time, allowing both an improved understanding of the volcanic system and enabling prediction of when eruptions might occur and what areas they were likely to affect. There were two types of dangerous eruptions at Montserrat. For the scorching-hot, block-and-ash hurricane-type eruption, caused by collapse of a growing lava mound over the volcano vent, the team could identify the time when their occurrence was probable, within a few hours, says Voight. \"We could also identify the directions they would travel. However, we could not reliably say for a given cycle if, in fact, a major collapse, with an exceptionally-long-running ash hurricane, would occur,\" he notes. \"But we could predict say 11 hours before hand, that if a collapse-generated ash hurricane were to occur, it would occur at a certain time and would probably move in a general direction.\" For the second type of eruption that involved large vertical explosions with nine-mile high eruption columns and ash hurricanes simultaneously in a number of river valleys, it became possible to forecast with some confidence each impending explosion. In general, this forecasting ability aided civil officials to define zoning and to carry out evacuation, and many lives were saved, says Voight of Penn State.\"The scientists could make predictions because the volcano had switched over to repetitive cyclic activity,\" says Voight.The magma inside the volcano contained water that was boiling off and trying to escape as the hot mass rose. When some of the water left the magma melt, the melt began to crystallize. Partially crystallized magma is much more viscous than uncrystallized magma. As a result, the thick, sticky magma plugged the upper part of the volcano's conduit. Then, pressure in magma underneath the plug built up, causing ground swelling and earthquakes, and eventually pushed the magma plug out of the way. Magma was then rapidly ejected and this commonly caused collapse of the surface lava mound and ash hurricanes.Researchers monitored the cycles of sticking and slipping, using state-of-the-art monitoring equipment and software provided by the U.S. Geologic Survey, the BGS and others, that allowed real-time data collection and analysis. The scientists could analyze events within minutes of their occurrence. Tilt meters high on the volcano indicated how much and where the pressure was building.As the lava dome grew, some large landslide collapses thinned areas of the dome, quickly reduced the external pressure inside and under the dome and made them more likely to be the site of vertical or horizontal explosions of hot ash and gases, says Voight. From these deep uncorked pockets, magma with fine bubbles of pressurized gas would explode outward causing hot ash hurricanes. These pyroclastic flows moved down toward the sea at speeds as fast as 70 m.p.h. The capital town of Plymouth was destroyed by these flows. \"It was a sad moment to watch Plymouth burn,\" says Voight. The pyroclastic flows happened right after the pressure peak in the stick slip cycle. Knowing the cyclic timing of the magma, the researchers could identify when eruptions might occur. Because the researchers also knew where the lava-dome deformations and slope failures were occurring, they could define the flow direction.The explosive eruptions in August 1997 happened because the magma corking the conduit became thin from a previous dome collapse and the underlying high pressure buildup popped the cork. The resulting explosions rose vertically as much as nine miles. Ballistic blocks a yard wide were shot out over a mile and ash hurricanes flowed in all sectors around the volcano, running to the sea.\"Because we were able to predict these eruptions, we were able to put teams in the field to document the explosive events by video, still photography and surveying. We are learning a lot from this data which is still being worked on,\" says Voight. He noted that this explosion destroyed his tilt meters.At least for now, the Soufriere Hills Volcano is relatively quiet. The last very large eruption occurred on Dec. 26, 1997, in where the south side of the whole volcano collapsed, and an explosive blast completely destroyed the two towns on that side of the island. The communities had been evacuated and no lives were lost. It was extremely fortunate that the evacuation was maintained, because no one could have survived the blast, says Voight.Magma is no longer rising to build the dome, but the volcano remains dangerous. The lava is still very hot -- 1300 degrees F -- and its surface is unstable. Occasional gravity collapses still cause ash hurricanes that can run to the sea. However, it appears that this activity is winding down. The researchers have found clear links among the seismic and deformation data from the volcano, the volcano's behavior and the way that gas and ash eruptions occur.\"Understanding these links advances our ability to interpret our data in terms of the physical processes and helps us to forecast the timing and, to a usable extent, the eruptive style of the volcano,\" says Voight. \"These results, which can be of use elsewhere, improve our ability to mitigate the very dangerous effects of explosive volcanism.\" The research team consisted of scientists from British Universities, the British Geological Survey, the Seismic Research Unit of the University of the West Indies, U.S.G.S. and Penn State. The members were Voight, R.S.J. Sparks, A.D. Miller, R.C.Stewart, R.P. Hoblitt, A. Clarke, J. Ewart, W. Aspinall, B. Baptie, T. H. Druitt, R. Herd, P. Jackson, A.M. Lejeune, A.B. Lockhart, S.C.

After this story was written, other major weather-related disasters occurred. For instance, major floods devastated partsof Korea in early August and extensive heavy rains in China led toflooding of the Yangtze River where there are preliminary reports ofmore than 2,000 deaths, over 14 million people homeless, and over $25billion in damage. Heat waves and air pollution episodes have alsoplagued many regions, particularly in Egypt, across the Mediterranean,and southern Europe. At least 10,000 Central Americans were killed andmany thousands more made homeless in the fall of 1998 by HurricaneMitch, the deadliest and fourth-strongest Atlantic hurricane of thiscentury.In the United States, several major weather-related stories with largehuman impacts and severe damage have occurred in the past year or so,and many stories linked the disasters to El Nino. Tornado outbreaks andfloods in Florida ($1 billion damage and at least 132 deaths, accordingto NOAA) were part of a pattern that led to the wettest winter(December-February) in the Southeast on record. Torrential rains inFebruary in California led to flooding in many locales, mudslides andcoastal erosion. Huge damage occurred in the winter ice storm in NewEngland and southeastern Canada, with loss of power to many communitiesfor several weeks. Meanwhile, the northern tier of states experiencedone of the mildest winters on record. Lake Erie failed to freeze foronly the third time on record.Spring brought flooding to several areas, such as Iowa, Indiana, and NewEngland, as part of generally wetter than normal conditions from Idahoto New England. Ohio River flooding left 30,000 people without power.Meanwhile drought enveloped the South. Extremely dry conditions fromApril through June 1998 led to wildfires which destroyed many structuresand charred 485,000 acres in Florida alone. In Texas the droughtcontinued into summer, bringing with it sweltering heat waves. Theseconditions have devastated agriculture throughout the state. Forinstance, the drought in Texas (the number-one U.S. cotton producer) andthe wetness in the winter and spring in California (the number-two U.S.cotton producer) led the U.S. Department of Agriculture in August toproject that the U.S. cotton crop would shrink by 24% from 1997. InCalifornia the losses come about because the wetness created anenvironment favorable to a soil fungus. Areas with drier than normalconditions or even droughts during El Nino, such as Indonesia, thePhilippines, Australia, Southeast Asia, Hawaii, and parts of Africa andBrazil, are apt to experience heavy rains during La Nina.Meanwhile, areas that experience floods in El Nino, such as Peru,Ecuador, Uruguay and northern Argentina in South America, parts ofAfrica and southern parts of the United States in winter are apt to bedrier than normal during La Nina events. In 1997, the strongest droughtset in over Indonesia and it led to many fires, set as part ofactivities of farmers and corporations clearing land for agriculture,raging out of control. With the fires came respiratory problems inadjacent areas 1000 kilometers distant and even a plane crash in thearea has been linked to the visibility problems.

While pleased with the results to date, \"there is clearly an aspect of tropical rainfall which does not  fit our conceptual models,\" said Dr. Christian Kummerow, TRMM project scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, MD.       \"At the moment, all fingers are pointing at the possibility that raindrops are significantly smaller than we used to believe.  Looking 'under the hood,' of clouds with radars and radiometers has given us a unique perspective on the rain and ice processes.  As soon as we make sense of all these new and sometimes contradictory observations, a whole new improved way of viewing and modeling rainfall processes should emerge.  These particle sizes have the potential effect of regulating the amount of water vapor and ice being pumped into the upper atmosphere, which plays a key role in global climate change studies,\" added Kummerow.      \"The cloud types and area coverage generated by the rainfall process can directly alter the heat balance of the atmosphere,\" said Arthur Hou, deputy TRMM project scientist at Goddard.  \"The combined view of this process from all the TRMM sensors is offering an unprecedented insight here.\"  Observations of cloud droplets near the cloud tops of thunderstorms have also yielded surprises.  \"The darker appearance of raining clouds and the unexpected suppression of rain in polluted atmospheres might be explained by the presence or absence of large raindrops near the cloud top,\" said Danny Rosenfeld, an Israeli scientist who is a member of the TRMM science team.     Scientists long have theorized that convection, or heat transfer, is different over land than over the ocean.  TRMM's sensors provided direct observational evidence that faster and stronger convective updrafts over land are contributing to the formation of \"taller\" continental storms with more lightning.  This is in contrast to the almost complete absence of lightning over the world's tropical oceans.     One unexpected phenomenon observed by TRMM was the massive tall chimney clouds in Hurricane Bonnie.  While monitoring the progress of one of this year's most dramatic hurricanes, NASA researchers obtained compelling images of Hurricane Bonnie showing a (cumulonimbus) storm cloud, towering like a sky scraper, 59,000 feet into the sky from the storm's eyewall.  This new view of \"hot towers\" in hurricanes could help forecasters predict hurricane intensity earlier, and identify those storms that will proceed to a stronger category.        Last July, TRMM shed new light on the phenomenon known as La Nina.  TRMM research team members successfully retrieved sea-surface temperature data from the TRMM Microwave Imager (TMI) instrument aboard the spacecraft.  This temperature data, obtained by the TMI, gives scientists the ability to obtain observations even in cloudy conditions.  The coincidence of having both an El Nino and a La Nina event is giving scientists a rare opportunity to study the evolution of these events and the transition from one to another.     La Nina is essentially the opposite of the El Nino phenomenon and is characterized by unusually cold ocean temperatures in the eastern equatorial Pacific.  An El Nino occurs when ocean temperatures are warmer than normal.  La Nina and El Nino often are spoken of together and termed the El Nino/Southern Oscillations, or \"ENSO.\"  La Nina sometimes is referred to as the cold phase of the ENSO.  An unexpected benefit from TRMM has been the almost immediate impact the data have had in improving the understanding of atmospheric water and energy cycle in assimilated global data sets.  While still early, scientists are very encouraged that this improvement will lead directly to enhanced research efforts as well as better weather forecasts.          TRMM is part of NASA's Earth Science Enterprise, a long-term research program designed to study the Earth's land, oceans, air, ice and life as a total system.

{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_826", "content": "The new world record was made by an ER-2, tail number 806, based at NASA's Dryden Flight Research Center, Edwards, CA, and occurred during an airborne science mission to measure different components in the atmosphere, such as water, ozone and other atmospheric particles.  The new record surpassed the old record of 62,500 feet, which was flown by a Canadian P-42 aircraft in 1988.  The record was for the aircraft medium weight class of 26,455 to 35,274 pounds at takeoff.     This record flight was not the first time the ER-2 has achieved such a high altitude.  The aircraft, a close relative of the U.S. Air Force U-2, routinely operates between 65,000 and 70,000 feet.  But this is the first time the ER-2's performance has been documented and made public.     \"This flight had two purposes,\" said Dryden ER-2 pilot Jim Barrilleaux, who flew this historic mission.  \"The science goal is the principle reason we flew the aircraft.  But achieving the world altitude record verifies all of the outstanding efforts by the people who have worked on the NASA ER-2s and U-2s throughout the years -- designers, builders, operators, maintainers and scientists.  This flight provides public acknowledgment of their good work.  I personally feel that I am doing this on their behalf and in their honor.\"     An official from the National Aeronautics Association (NAA) observed the record-setting event and will process the formal certification with the Federal Aeronautique Internationale (FAI).  The FAI is the international organization responsible for the coordination of competition and certification of all world aviation records.  The NAA, as the U.S. representative of the FAI, is responsible for coordination and certification of all aviation records in the United States.     NASA owns and operates two ER-2 aircraft for its Airborne Science Program.  Built by the Lockheed Martin Skunk Works, the aircraft collect information about our surroundings, including Earth resources, celestial observations, atmospheric chemistry and dynamics and oceanic processes.  The aircraft also are used for electronic sensor research and development, satellite calibration and satellite data validation.     A NASA ER-2 recently concluded a six-week hurricane study originating from Patrick Air Force Base, FL, designed to improve scientists' ability to forecast, track and measure the intensity of hurricanes.  As part of the mission, the ER-2 flew above Hurricane Bonnie, collecting valuable information that could ultimately save lives and money.     In 1981, NASA acquired its first ER-2 aircraft.  The agency obtained a second ER-2 in 1989.  These airplanes replaced two Lockheed U-2 aircraft, which NASA had used to collect science data since 1971.  The U-2s, and later the ER-2s, were based at NASA's Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, CA, until 1997, at which time the ER-2 aircraft and their operations moved to Dryden.      Since the program's inaugural flight on Aug. 31, 1971, NASA U-2s and ER-2s have flown over 4,000 data missions and test flights in support of scientific research conducted by scientists from NASA, other government agencies, universities and the private sector.     For most missions, the ER-2 operates at altitudes between 65,000 and 70,000 feet.  Depending on aircraft weight, the ER-2 reaches a cruise altitude of 65,000 feet within twenty minutes.  Typical cruise speed is 470 miles per hour.  The range for a normal six-hour mission is approximately 2,500 miles, which yields five hours of data collection at high altitude.  The aircraft is capable of longer missions of more than eight hours and ranges of more than 3,400 miles.  The ER-2 can carry a maximum payload of 2,600 pounds, distributed in the equipment bay, nose area and wing pods."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_827", "content": "Contrary to popular belief, epidemics and plagues don't usually follow natural disasters, according to experts at PAHO, which is working with the health sector in Honduras, Nicaragua, and other Central American countries to reduce the risk of outbreaks that could arise as a result of Mitch. Dr. Hugo Prado, of PAHO's Emergency Preparedness and Disaster Relief Program, says \"after a disaster such as Hurricane Mitch, outbreaks and epidemics are not automatic. Public health problems are a consequence of other issues, such as the destruction or disruption of water supplies.\" PAHO is coordinating requests from countries affected by the disaster. Honduras and Nicaragua have reported that they need specific medicines, insecticides and equipment for mosquito control, waste disposal systems, health education and communication assistance, hospital equipment, and materials for water purification including granular hypochloride, 5-gallon plastic water jugs, and equipment to measure residual chlorine. Dr. Prado emphasized that PAHO does not support indiscriminate sending of medicines, which can clog the supply delivery system. Without improvements in sanitary conditions, health problems most likely to initially occur are diarrheal diseases, as a consequence of the use of unsafe water, Dr. Prado emphasized. Later on, the confinement of a large number of people in crowded shelters or in the homes of family and friends can generate problems such as diarrheal diseases because of unsafe water or food, as well as skin rashes, conjunctivitis, and other problems related to crowding. Leptospirosis, a disease transmitted by the urine or feces of rodents, can be a problem in flooded areas as well, he said. A health threat that can develop later on is the uncontrolled proliferation of vectors like the mosquitoes that can transmit diseases such as dengue fever, malaria and others. According to Dr. Prado, the response of the health sector to a disaster such as the one that affected Honduras, Nicaragua, and Belize can usually be described in 3 steps. The first is the immediate life-saving first aid to the people hurt in the disaster. The second step, and the most important one, is to provide safe water to as much of the population as possible, to reduce the risk of disease transmission. The last step, which can only be attained in the long run, is to put the health system of the country back on its feet, repairing damages in hospitals, clinics, and health centers, and ensuring that the basic sanitation infrastructure is repaired. PAHO is working with the Central American countries most affected by Hurricane Mitch to coordinate foreign health assistance. This coordination effort is necessary, according to Dr. Prado, to ensure that external aid meets the real needs of the countries. PAHO, which is also the regional office for the Americas of the World Health Organization, issued an emergency appeal for immediate aid to the health sector in Central America after Hurricane Mitch, based on requests from the countries and its own evaluations. The U.S. and Sweden have already responded with $500,000 each in immediate aid, and Canada has given $250,000 and is sending a C-130 transport plane with supplies to Honduras and El Salvador today. Across Central America and in southern Mexico, 10,001 people were dead, 14,202 were missing and 2.78 million were homeless, according to figures."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_828", "content": "\"People may not take proper precautions because they've been misled into thinking they've been through far worse storms than they actually have,\" said Clemson wind engineering professor Peter Sparks. \"If winds in Hurricane Georges had blown as hard as stated by official sources, then the whole of the Gulf Coast would be torn apart like South Florida after Hurricane Andrew.\" Sparks has studied wind conditions in hurricanes for the past 15 years and has testified on wind-safety issues before a Congressional subcommittee. He is part of a research effort at Clemson that focuses on finding ways to strengthen homes and schools against the ravages of high-wind events such as hurricanes. \"Bonnie, Earl and Georges were three of the most heavily researched storms in history. Aircraft measurement, dropsondes and data buoys, as well as coastal and inland wind-recording sites, gave researchers a clear picture of what was going on - and the data simply didn't support the claims of the National Hurricane Center,\" Sparks said. In the most recent example of Hurricane Georges, the National Hurricane Center reported maximum sustained winds of 100 mph as it made landfall. But Sparks said an analysis of information from data buoys and land stations by the Hurricane Research Division of the National Oceanic and Aeronautic Administration put the figure at only 84 mph for ocean exposures - which would mean overland speeds would be even lower. The situation in Georges was complicated by some instrumentation problems, Sparks said. Valuable data from automatic weather stations in Gulfport and Pascagoula were lost because neither station had emergency-power capability, a common failing among the more than 900 automatic weather stations deployed by the National Weather Service, FAA and the military in recent years. Data from those stations would have helped to determine the validity of gusts of 175 mph reported at the nearby Keesler Airforce Base in Biloxi, which uses a type of wind-speed measuring device that's been proven to give erroneously high results when wet, Sparks said. He added that erroneous reports also went out after Hurricane Bonnie, with the National Hurricane Center issuing reports that a Category -- hurricane with sustained winds of 115 mph had swept over Wilmington, N.C., even as the National Weather Service at Wilmington measured and reported a maximum of only 56 mph. \"The scientific information is there, but the National Hurricane Center is not using it properly. Even when we have good data - such as in Wilmington during Bonnie - nobody takes any notice of it. Despite great improvements in instrumentation, data transmission and significant improvements in track forecasts, the National Hurricane Center's reports of prevailing wind conditions have got worse, not better, over the years,\" Sparks said. The problem has been long-standing, said Sparks. In 1985, he led a National Academy of Sciences team that investigated Hurricane Elena, which made landfall in almost exactly the same place as Georges. Having spent months recovering wind-data from the area, the team concluded that there was no justification for the wind speeds claimed by the National Hurricane Center. \"Government officials reported sustained winds of 100 mph and gusts of 175 mph for Georges, yet it's virtually impossible to find any wind damage. We got more accurate reports from the meteorological services in the tiny Caribbean islands than we got from the United States.\" Wind speeds, as currently reported, are too easily open for misinterpretation by the public and press, Sparks said. For example, the National Hurricane Center uses the term \"maximum sustained wind\" to describe wind speed averaged over one minute at 33 feet above the surface - a quantity not measured directly by any meteorological station in the world and at odds with the World Meteorological Organization's sustained-wind standard that requires measuring wind over at least a 10-minute period. Since gust speeds are widely reported by weather stations and often quoted by the media, it may make more sense for the National Hurricane Center, in its public advisories, to give wind speeds in terms of gusts instead of the more difficult-to-understand sustained wind speeds, Sparks said.

{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_829", "content": "These barrier islands, about 60 miles east of New Orleans and 30 miles south of Biloxi, Miss., are the first line of defense against storms for eastern Louisiana, especially the New Orleans area, and western Mississippi. The string of islands buffers the mainland from both the wind and storm surges associated with hurricanes, tropical storms and winter storms in the Gulf of Mexico. Dr. Robert E. Stewart, director of the U.S. Geological Survey's National Wetlands Research Center in Lafayette, La., has been involved in studies related to the islands for the past 18 years and video taped the islands as Dr. Thomas Michot, wildlife research biologist, flew. Stewart said, \"The concern is that, even if the water goes down some, areas of vegetated land masses will have been swept away on this island chain. When barrier islands are destroyed, the mainlands behind them become more vulnerable to storms.\" Michot, who has been studying ducks and seagrasses at the Chandeleurs, said, \"I have flown over the Chandeleur Islands after every tropical storm and hurricane for the past 10 or 11 years, and I have never seen so much damage. The only things visible on the main island are marshes, and a few dunes and flats of newly deposited sediments. There is no visible beach.\" The entire island is covered with dozens of overwash channels, making the Gulf of Mexico continuous with the Chandeleur Sound, he added. Michot said that a lighthouse is now standing in open water, about 400 yards north of the nearest land. Before the storm, the lighthouse was on vegetated land, which extended for another 1200 yards north of the lighthouse. Stewart said that before the hurricane there had been dunes higher than the 6-foot high boardwalk near the lighthouse, but that only the very top of the boardwalk is now visible. This indicates that those sand dunes have already been washed away. The Chandeleur Islands are not only important in protecting the mainland, Stewart said, but they also contribute to a recreational and commercial fishery and are one of the four major wintering grounds of migratory redhead ducks. He said that seagrass beds serve as nursery areas for fish and shellfish such as shrimp and crabs and as food for ducks. Stewart added that the water was very turbid when they flew, so they could not see the seagrasses to assess their damage. Both Stewart and Michot predict a good deal of burial of seagrass beds in the backbarrier flats on the shallower Chandeleur Sound side of the islands. Wintering redhead ducks are almost totally dependent on shoalgrass, one of the five seagrass species present on the islands. Michot said, \"If shoalgrasses are wiped out on the Chandeleurs, 20,000 redhead ducks that usually winter there will need to find other winter sites along the Gulf Coast in Florida, Texas or Mexico.\" Researchers at the National Wetlands Research Center plan to fly back over the island soon and begin mapping and monitoring the islands and their seagrass beds. The Center did extensive research during Hurricane Andrew and is still studying the effects of that hurricane, some of which have been published in scholarly journals and described in a general-interest publication, \"Willful Winds.\" The center is also involved in hurricane-related research projects along the Gulf and Atlantic coasts. Additionally, USGS scientists of the Coastal and Marine Geology Program in St. Petersburg, Fla., are studying the effects of hurricanes. Photos and video clips of the Chandeleur Island damage are available under \"What's New\" on the center's website As the nation's largest water, earth and biological science and civilian mapping agency, the USGS works in cooperation with more than 2,000 organizations across the country to provide reliable, impartial scientific information to resource managers, planners and other customers. This information is gathered in every state by USGS scientists to minimize the loss of life and property from natural disasters, to contribute to the conservation and the sound economic and physical development of the nation's natural resources and to enhance the quality of life by monitoring water, biological, energy and mineral resources."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_830", "content": "For the second time this summer, Wurman and a research team from the University of Oklahoma will drive two such \"Doppler on Wheels\" units into the face of a hurricane reaching landfall--Hurricane Georges. With funding from the National Science Foundation (NSF), Wurman studies patterns in hurricane winds that may help in forecasting the evolution of these storms once they hit land. \"Hurricanes spawn damaging winds well inland,\" said Wurman, \"but they can also cause tornadoes and flooding. We are trying to figure out how patterns of winds and rain develop in hurricanes, and determine why and where a storm will produce floods and funnel clouds.\"For many years, meteorologists have used Doppler radar at fixed locations to monitor weather patterns, as seen in weather forecasts on television. Due to advances in technology, Doppler radar has evolved to the point where it can be mounted to mobile platforms like Wurman's \"Doppler on Wheels.\"The vehicle itself is an odd-looking configuration of generators, equipment and an operator cabin welded to a large flatbed truck. The most prominent feature, however, is the large conical base and wide dish of the Doppler radar. \"Considering that one radar unit is pink and yellow, and the other is blue and green, we do get our fair share of funny looks as we're heading to a storm,\" said Wurman.\"The biggest advantage of 'Doppler on Wheels' is that Wurman can collect more data with better precision,\" said Stephan Nelson, program manager in the NSF's division of atmospheric sciences, which funds Wurman's research. \"Hurricanes rarely oblige to move in the path of two correctly spaced Doppler systems. Since we can't move the storm, it's awfully convenient that we can move the radar.\"In addition to studying hurricanes, these trucks have also been used to study tornadoes. Since the project began in 1995, researchers have taken advantage of the mobility of \"Doppler on Wheels\" to map, for the first time, tornado winds. With these Doppler maps of tornadoes, they gained new insight into how tornadoes form and evolve. In August, Wurman's team took the mobile radar systems to meet Hurricane Bonnie in North Carolina. While riding through 12 hours of storm, these researchers were the first to observe hurricane wind streaks, intense bursts of wind over a short distance. The wind streaks detected in Bonnie were similar to those that Wurman initially observed during his first hurricane mission in 1996. \"These are probably the hallmarks of a landing hurricane,\" said Wurman.Wind streaks, he hypothesized, are probably caused by boundary layer rolls, portions of the storm where the wind is influenced by the friction between the earth's surface and storm. Peak speeds of these wind streaks can be as much as 50 miles per hour (mph) higher than average winds. \"Obviously, short bursts of 120-mph winds can do a lot more damage to houses and trees than 70-mph winds can,\" Wurman says.Wurman will have another chance to collect data this year as Hurricane Georges reaches the continental United States."}

Telephone contact with the observatorywas lost late Tuesday morning, and full assessment of any damage is not yetavailable.As the eye of the hurricane passed just to the south of the telescope, 15people remained at the observatory, according to Donald Campbell, associatedirector of the National Astronomy Ionospheric Center at Cornell Universityin Ithaca, N.Y., which manages the observatory for the National ScienceFoundation (NSF).  All were \"bunkered down\" and protected from thehurricane, he said.  The observatory has 140 employees and visitors.There were reports of fallen trees and mud slides around the observatory.Interestingly, at the time of the hurricane, a group of researchers fromClemson University, Clemson, S.C., and from France were making radarobservations of thunderstorms.  Instead, they used Arecibo's dish to recordobservations of high-altitude wind speeds in the hurricane throughoutMonday night, using electrical power from an emergency generator.Although government and communications officials say telephone lines areopen to the island, the NAIC and Cornell News Service were not in contactwith the observatory, as of Wednesday morning.The surface of the Arecibo reflector dish is made of 38,800 reflectivealuminum panels, covering an area about the size of 26 football fields.Campbell said that  only a few panels on the 16,000 square feet of thedish's surface were lost as the hurricane moved through.The dome above the telescope, which was completed last year, survived thehurricane without damage, Campbell said.

{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_832", "content": "The USGS maintains a network of 123 real-time gaging stations in Puerto Rico, part of a nationwide network of more than 4,000 real-time stations (part of a larger national network of nearly 7,000 stations) that keep a close eye on what is happening with the country's rivers and streams. A preliminary assessment of the streamflow network in Puerto Rico shows that about 12 stations were severely damaged.Because Puerto Rico is so often in the path of destructive hurricanes, USGS hydrologists had developed contingency operations to ensure that information on the effect of hurricane rains on local rivers would be available to those who need it. The streamflow gaging stations in Puerto Rico have been outfitted with satellite-linked data collection platforms that transmit streamflow in real time to the main computer in the USGS Puerto Rico office in San Juan. The entire computer and data relay system in Puerto Rico was backed up with a diesel-powered generator to ensure that information would continue to flow no matter what Mother Nature might do. Throughout the hurricane's pass over the island, data was received into USGS computers from the backup system and data has been provided on a continuous basis to key cooperators.The streamflow data for Puerto Rico and the other real-time stations throughout the United States are available to the public from the USGS via the World Wide Web As an example of the enormous rise in streamflow that can occur as a result of such torrential hurricane rains, the Rio de la Plata at Highway 2 at Toa Alta, downstream from the Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority reservoir, rose from about 10 cubic feet per second (cfs) to a maximum discharge of more than 130,000 cfs in less than 24 hours. Based on historic records available for this river, this may be the great discharge recorded at this site.The USGS commitment to keep information flowing had a very human side during Hurricane Georges. Dianne Lopez-Trujillo, a computer specialist in the San Juan office, who is also a graduate student at the University of Puerto Rico at Mayaguez, stayed throughout the night to keep the computers operating and to keep information going to the Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority. Information on streamflow stage (river height) and discharge (velocity of the river moving past a given point) are critical to reservoir operators in ensuring that reservoirs are not overtopped and that releases can be made to minimize flooding. Preliminary reports from the island were that reservoir gates were open.While the USGS district office remains closed in the wake of Hurricane Georges, hydrologists continue as best they can to meet their flood response commitments. Teams of hydrologists will be going out to note high-water marks in order to make \"indirect\" measurements of the discharge of rivers, to delineate the height of storm surges, to map inundated areas and to document the height and severity of flooding. Such post-flood information is critical in developing models of patterns of flooding, or recurrence intervals, that are essential in preparing for future flood events.As the nation's largest water, earth and biological science, and civilian mapping agency, the USGS works in cooperation with more than 2,000 organizations across the country to provide reliable, impartial scientific information to resource managers, planners, and other customers.

Clemson researchers hope to have the computer program available to emergency management personnel in time for next year's hurricane season. \"This tool gives our state emergency preparedness officials a way to mobilize their resources and manpower to the areas that will most need help. It's often difficult to mobilize help once the hurricane has already come ashore and caused damage. This way, we can be ready to lend assistance the moment it's needed,\" said Rosowky. \"Emergency managers and planners are often inundated with information and misinformation as a storm approaches. A wide variety of wind speeds is reported by the media, and it is difficult - if not impossible - for them to sort these out and rank them in terms of both credibility and applicability to their particular situations and locations.\" The Clemson computer modeling system can be used both for short-term planning as a storm approaches or for long-term studies and 'what-if' scenarios by emergency management personnel, emergency planners and the insurance industry. Researchers hope to be able to predict not only damage to residential structures but also maximum wind speed and estimated time of occurrence. All results will be displayed by zip code using a Geographic Information System. The predictions are based on hurricane tracking information supplied by reconnaissance aircraft that is integrated into a computer model based on information gathered from previous storms. The computer modeling system is part of a larger project funded by the S.C. Sea Grant Consortium to develop a hurricane hazard assessment system for the State of South Carolina. Rosowsky is the lead investigator of the multi-year project. Coastal areas along South Carolina were left devastated in the wake of Hurricane Hugo, which in September 1989 caused billions of dollars in damage. Through its research, Clemson is finding new ways to save lives and property in peril from potentially devastating wind storms by providing engineering data for new and existing construction.

{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_834", "content": "And while looking Bonnie in the eye, she winked.Ocean waves, whipped by Bonnie to 2.4 to 3.6 meters (8-12 ft) high, crashed ashore a few hundred meters from the runway at Patrick Air Force Base, Fla., where a DC-8 prepared for the first-ever NASA jet flight into the eye of an Atlantic hurricane on Sunday afternoon.The jetliner, flying at 11 km (37,000 ft), was joined at the storm by a NASA ER-2 jet overhead at 19.8 km (65,000 ft), and a NOAA WP-3D Orion turboprop 4.6 km (15,000 ft). The NASA planes took off at 1:34 p.m. EDT on their seven-hour mission.\"This is a significant achievement for this hurricane study,\" said Robbie Hood, mission scientist from NASA's Global Hydrology and Climate Center in Huntsville, Ala. \"We achieved our number one objective, that we could accomplish the tricky maneuver of placing all three NASA and NOAA aircraft in the study of the structure of the same storm at the same time.\"The research program, called CAMEX-3, is a combined study effort including eight NASA Centers, NOAA, and a contingent of scientists from universities across the nation.The aircraft performed four passes over the eye of the then-Category-2 storm, centered at 24.5 N, 71.4 W. Two of the passes were coordinated with a NOAA Orion passing below. Researchers could not see into the eye on two passes due to cloud cover, but recorded infrared images on each pass. The location of the eye was obtained by information passed along by scientists stationed at Patrick Air Force Base or aboard NOAA's Orion aircraft (like the one at right).Once the aircraft reached the first hurricane of the 1998 season, the researchers encountered an unusual phenomenon: As the three aircraft flew in a stacked pattern, the eye wall turned from an oval to a oblong shape.\"This reshaping of the eye wall is characteristic of a hurricane that has stalled, and is preparing for a dramatic shift, either stronger or dying,\" said Dr. Ed Zipser, a weather expert from Texas A&M University.Another impressive step was taken when NASA researchers gave Bonnie some eye drops. Ten small tubes containing miniature weather stations were dropped into Bonnie's shifting eye to check her vital signs &SHY; wind speeds, barometric pressure, and humidity levels. The tiny weather stations dropped into the middle of the eye verified the readings the DC-8 remote sensing instruments were reading at 11 km (37,000 ft).Dropsondes can measure temperature, horizontal wind speed, pressure, and humidity from altitudes as great as 24 km (15 mi) until landing. The sondes themselves are marvels of miniaturization, only 7 cm (2.75 in) in diameter and 40.6 cm (16 in) long, and weighing just 400 grams (less than a pound).The RSS903 dropsonde used in CAMEX-3 and other campaigns were developed by the National Center for Atmospheric Research and the German Space Agency (DLR) jointly developed the new model to use advanced sensors and to incorporate Global Positioning Satellite (GPS) receivers. This last feature gives scientists precise measurements of the sonde's location - including altitude - as it is carried along by a storm. With Bonnie pushing towards the coast, wrote forecaster R. Wohlman, the Eastern U.S. is dominated by an intense high-pressure region. This is causing any shortwaves from the west to ride far north into Minnesota, Michigan, and Illinois. Otherwise, Ohio valley through Colorado is clear. Remnants of Tropical Storm Charlie, which charged ashore in the Texas gulf region, have slowed, filled and dropped lots of much needed rain over the southern half of the dry Lone Star state. I would expect that this moisture, which shows up well in the satellite water vapor imagery, would continue its westward movement. A large region of cloudiness and associated moisture is moving thou the New England states, and is forecast to slowly drift off shore. If there is a weakness in the extensive anti-cyclonic area over the U.S., it might develop just offshore, between that high and the one located in the mid-Atlantic.Meanwhile, Bonnie continues to develop nicely. Winds up to 167 km/h (90 knots) sustained observed in the morning reconnaissance, but much to the consternation of the forecasters at the National Hurricane Center, forward motion has all but ceased. At 11 a.m. (15Z), Bonnie was centered at 24.2N, 71.6W and forecast to start moving northwest, then gradually shift northward.

Results from the mission may increase warning time -- saving lives and property -- and decrease the size of evacuation areas -- saving money -- while giving scientists a better understanding of these dramatic weather phenomena. CAMEX will yield high-resolution information on hurricane structure, dynamics and motion, leading to improved hurricane prediction. Results also will be used to validate existing measurements from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission of hurricanes and tropical storms and to develop mathematical models for future Earth science missions.Led by the Atmospheric Dynamics and Remote Sensing program at NASA Headquarters, Washington, DC, the experiment unites eight NASA centers, other government weather researchers and the university community for a coordinated, multi-agency and -university Atlantic hurricane and tropical storm study. \"We only know what goes on in the bottom half of a hurricane -- from sea level to 27,000 feet,\" said atmospheric expert, Ms. Robbie Hood of the Global Hydrology and Climate Center at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala. \"With all of the agencies and the university community working together, we now can learn about these storms from top to bottom -- and hopefully improve hurricane prediction.\" When a hurricane or tropical storm erupts in the Atlantic, a NASA Dryden Flight Research Center DC-8 -- equipped with instruments to measure the storm's structure, environment and changes in intensity and tracking -- will fly into the storm at 35,000-40,000 feet. At the same time, a specially equipped Dryden ER-2 -- a high-altitude research plane -- will soar above the storm at 65,000 feet. The modified U-2 will measure the storm's structure and the surrounding atmosphere that steers the storm's movement. On the ground, the storm research team will launch weather balloons and monitor land-based sensors to validate the high-altitude measurements taken by instruments aboard the planes. Hood and her team plan to fly the NASA planes in conjunction with scheduled storm flights of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) that will take off from MacDill Air Force Base, Tampa, Fla., and the \"Hurricane Hunters\" -- the U.S. Air Force's 53rd Weather Reconnaissance Squadron from Keesler Air Force Base, Miss. The Air Force's Hurricane Hunters and NOAA routinely fly into tropical storms and hurricanes to determine their location, motion, strength and size. Information gathered by the two organizations is used to predict the potential strength and size of the storms as well as landfall. In addition to providing Doppler radars on each research plane, NASA for the first time will bring state-of-the-art airborne instruments to measure moisture and wind fields around the hurricanes under observation.NOAA flies a WP-3 \"Orion\" -- a four engine turboprop plane -- into storms at altitudes below 27,000 feet. And the Hurricane Hunters fly a WC-130 \"Hercules\" -- also a four-engine turboprop craft -- at 5,000-10,000 feet. \"We will analyze the high-altitude storm information within the context of more traditional low-level aircraft observations, and satellite and ground-based radar observations,\" said Hood. \"This new information should provide insight to hurricane modelers -- forecasters who continually strive to improve hurricane predictions.\" Scientific instruments provided by Marshall to be flown on the Dryden aircraft will be augmented by instruments from NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Md.; Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif,; Langley Research Center, Hampton, Va.; and Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, Calif. The hurricane study is part of NASA's Earth Science enterprise to better understand the total Earth system and the effects of natural and human-induced changes on the global environment."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_836", "content": "Examining some basic data sets in a way that has never been tried before, ASU climatologists Randall Cerveny and Robert Balling, Jr. have found proof for what many a weekend boater has secretly suspected: rain is most likely to occur along the Atlantic coast on the weekend and the weather is most likely to be better on a Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday. The most obvious culprit is the \"natural\" cloud-seeding effect created by the massive drift of East Coast pollution, which also follows a well defined weekly cycle. The gray, smelly cloud of pollution has a strange silver lining, however. While pollution makes for more rainy weekends, it also apparently reduces the intensity of hurricanes that hit over the weekend, such that weekend hurricanes tend to be much weaker than, say, Tuesday storms.\"Hurricanes are the biggest storms that we have on this planet, in terms of energy and precipitation,\" noted Cerveny. \"And what we've found is that we're having an impact on them. It's a little daunting, when you start to think about it.\"Cerveny and Balling examined and compared three different data sets -- daily carbon monoxide and ozone measurements from a Canadian monitoring station on Sable Island off the coast of Nova Scotia, daily satellite-derived rainfall data for the Atlantic Ocean, and databases of coastal Atlantic hurricane measurements. In each case, when the two ASU scientists examined the data by day of the week, they found significant differences between days, and similar patterns of variation, with pronounced differences between beginnings and the ends of weeks. All three sets of climate data revealed a seven-day cycle.\"The human week is not a natural time period,\" said Balling. \"Human effect on weather is the only explanation.\" \"If you're going to go out boating in the Atlantic, you're going to get wet if it's a weekend,\" Cerveny said. \"And what we suggest is that this is probably linked to the pollution cycle.\"In examining precipitation in the Atlantic, they found no daily variation when looking at the ocean as a whole, but a pronounced sine-wave pattern of variation for just the coastal areas, with average daily precipitation rising on Thursday and into the weekend and then dipping from Sunday through the middle of the week. Balling notes that when the team analyzed satellite data grid cells for an area a little further away from the coast, they found the same pattern, time-shifted in accordance with the rate of pollution drift. Though the study does not directly address causation, a comparable fluctuation in the levels of East Coast air pollution points to an obvious connection. The fact that coastal hurricane intensity data taken from 1945 to 1996 follow a similar pattern (rather than being statistically uniform for each day of the week, as one would expect), supports this hypothesis.\"The fact that pollution can affect rainfall is actually well understood,\" said Balling. \"We just had to look for the evidence in the right place. The hurricane data, though, surprised the heck out of me.\" \"We knew that cities have an effect on local weather with urban heat islands and so forth, and people are pretty sure that we're having a general global effect with carbon dioxide,\" said Cerveny. \"But nobody had ever looked at the in-between area of large-scale regional weather. We appear to be affecting global weather on a scale that is comparable to El Nino.\"The hypothesis is particularly important when applied to hurricanes, because of the destructive potential of the storms. Cerveny and Balling looked at 50 years worth of hurricane records, which include observations taken every 6 hours and found surprising statistical differences with important implications. \"Storms are substantially weaker during the first part of the week and stronger in the last part of the week,\" said Cerveny. \"Pollution's thermal changes on the storm are apparently helping hurricanes blow themselves out. The difference is as high as 10 miles-per-hour wind speed, downgrading the storm almost as much as a Saffir-Simpson Scale category, meaning that if a hurricane were to hit on Tuesday or Thursday, it might be a Category 3, but if it were to hit on a Saturday or Sunday, it might be only be a Category 2.\" Cerveny notes that the effect is similar to a weather-control method once attempted in a military experiment: \"Back in the 1960s, the military had a project called Project Storm Fury that was developed to cloud-seed hurricanes. What we're suggesting here is that they were on the right track, but they just didn't do it on a large enough scale. We're looking at the combined pollution from the entire eastern seaboard -- that's what it takes to influence a hurricane.\"Though the study has interesting implications, what most surprised the ASU scientists was the fact that no other researcher had ever attempted to analyze these major data sets in such a basic way.\"Interestingly, no one had ever looked at this pollution data from a daily standpoint before and, curiously, nobody has bothered to look at seven-day cycles in the weather data,\" said Cerveny. \"Oftentimes the most fundamental research is that way you say to yourself 'why didn't anybody look at this' When we were putting this together, we went through every journal we could find, saying 'somebody has got to have done this before!' Luckily for us, no one had.\"Cerveny and Balling's study can by found in the August 6 issue of Nature. A simplified version can also be found on the World Wide Web at"}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_837", "content": "Through a quirk of fate, the biologists saw one study metamorphose into a completely different one that graphically reveals how natural forces periodically play with an ecosystem's populations and tip the so-called \"balance of nature.\"Jonathan Losos, Ph.D., associate professor of biology at Washington University in St. Louis, and biologists David A. Spiller and Thomas W. Schoener at the University of California, Davis, had just finished censusing lizard and spider populations on 19 tiny islands in the Bahamas when Hurricane Lili hit the area on October 19. The trio had introduced lizards to the islands in 1993 to conduct an experiment, \"the effect of predators on island ecosystems.\" The day after the hurricane blew through the large island of Great Exuma, where they were staying, the biologists quickly took to their boats to re-examine the islands for a suddenly different study, \"the effect of natural catastrophe on island organisms.\" Fate had handed them a marvelously unique chance to record results that previously had only been hypothesized.The scientists published the results of their study in the July 31, 1998 issue of Science magazine.Eleven of the islands -- all about one-third the size of an American football field -- experienced 110-mph winds; eight other islands on the northeast of Great Exuma also were directly hit by Lili after it had passed over Great Exuma. Location made a difference in the fate of organisms. Spiders and lizards were completely wiped out and vegetation greatly damaged on the 11 southwest, or catastrophically hit, islands, whereas populations of lizards were reduced approximately by one-third and those of spiders nearly 80 percent on the northeast, or moderately damaged, islands. Vegetation was affected, but to a much smaller degree.The group found proof of several ecological principles. One is that the recovery rate of different organisms increases strongly with their ability to disperse. For instance, spiders, which produce a silk string to which they cling and get blown into areas courtesy of wind ( a phenomenon called \"ballooning\"), rebounded quickly on islands where they had been wiped out, unlike lizards, which don't have such \"high-tech\" dispersal abilities.Another is that larger organisms, lizards in this case, are more resistant to the immediate impact of moderate disturbance than smaller organisms. On the moderately disturbed islands, lizard populations were less affected by the hurricane than were spider populations, but the spiders rebounded much more quickly because of their more prolific breeding capability.A third is that the risk of extinction is related to population size when disturbance is moderate but not when it is catastrophic. In relation to this, the biologists uncovered perhaps the first concrete evidence of how hurricanes wreak devastation on low-lying island organisms. It's not the wind so much as the water. The biologists found a starfish on top of one southwest island, and sand deposits on many of the islands, which were bereft of spiders and lizards. This indicated that a tidal surge as high as 15 to 20 feet -- a response to the lower air pressure caused by the hurricane -- inundated the islands, which are about five feet above sea level.\"All of the study islands are within several miles of Great Exuma, which is at most one mile wide,\" explained Losos. \"While hurricanes slow down over land, a mile width is not enough to substantially slow down a hurricane. Thus, the wind speed of the hurricane probably was the same for all of the islands. However, the indications are that the southwest islands were immersed in water for a while. The northeast ones weren't because the size of Great Exuma is substantial enough to halt the impetus of a storm surge. The effect is that with the whole ocean at a higher level for several hours, everything that wasn't stripped away when the surge hit the island was drowned or carried off by water.\"Losos said there are several unique aspects to the study.\"We had data on the island ecosystems for the three years preceeding the storm,\" he said. \"Many times scientists go into an ecosystem and study the affects in the aftermath of a disturbance, but they don't know the situation beforehand. Moreover, we had information not just on past populations, but on populations immediately before the event and immediately afterward. We know exactly what effect the hurricane had on the islands because we had been there just days before and then we repeatedly visited the sites in the following months to see how the ecosystem recovered.\"The investigators came back to the islands six weeks after the hurricane and during regular intervals up to one year to census populations and observe vegetation regrowth.\"Moreover, it has long been a hypothesis that the reason you don't find these common lizards on the small islands is that hurricanes keep coming in and wiping them out,\" Losos said \"And because lizards don't get from one island to another very readily, once they're wiped out, they don't come back. Well, now that hypothesis is documented.\"Over the past 20 years there has been increasing discussion and debate over the role of natural disturbances -- flood, fire, winds -- in structuring ecosystems. The question is: do they play a major, or transient role? The results of the Spiller, Losos, Schoener study lean toward a conclusion that rare catastrophic events may plan an important role and have a long-lasting effect on an ecosystem's content.\"To my knowledge, this is one of the best documented studies of the effect of catastrophic disturbances,\" said Losos. \"We have before-and-after data, a set of islands that were devastated as opposed to others that were moderately damaged, and multiple islands from which we can deduce general principles. We were very happy that there were no serious injuries on Great Exuma during the hurricane, but we also know how lucky we were to be there when it happened to come up with a study such as this.\""}

The Clemson facility is the only one in the nation able to give a complete picture of the effects of wind on so-called \"low-rise structures\" like homes, schools and churches. That's because it tests not only the wind load on structures - i.e., how strong the wind is - but also the reciprocating resistance of the building itself - i.e., how strong the building is. \"Studying only one side of the equation gives an incomplete picture,\" said Sill, an Alumni Distinguished Professor of Civil Engineering at Clemson. Dr. Sill, along with other Clemson researchers, was part of the team that made recommendations on construction practices in the wake of Hurricane Andrew in 1992.

{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_839", "content": "The current El NiÃ±o is different than most, however, and this difference may help researchers solve the mystery behind some curious atmospheric trends, like why the average intensity of North Pacific hurricanes is increasing over time.Jay Hobgood, associate professor of geography at Ohio State, and graduate student Luke Whitney reviewed 31 years of weather data and found that hurricanes in the 7 years during which a severe El NiÃ±o visited the North Pacific were not much more intense than hurricanes during the other 24 years. Hurricanes during El NiÃ±o years averaged 49.3 percent of the maximum possible intensity, versus 48.6 percent in non-El NiÃ±o years. The work appeared in a recent issue of the Journal of Climate.Hobgood explained that the warm surface water caused by El NiÃ±o off the west coast of South America heats the air and gives rise to stormy weather over the Pacific as far north as Southern California. The researchers expected that El NiÃ±o would intensify hurricanes in that area, but it didnât.âWe were surprised,â said Hobgood. âBut then we realized that El NiÃ±o also may generate more wind shear. In the Atlantic, wind shear keeps the storms down. We think that in the Pacific the warm water and the wind shear may cancel each other out.âIn fact, wind shear is the major reason that most hurricanes only reach 40 to 80 percent of their maximum possible intensity.âBut this El NiÃ±o is different,â said Hobgood. âMost El NiÃ±os start around Christmas, but this El NiÃ±o started in March of 1997. The warming was also greater than anything weâve seen this century, and during the hurricane season it didnât create much wind shear to weaken storms over the Eastern North Pacific. On the average, El NiÃ±os arenât going to have much of an effect on hurricanes, but this one has.âThe continued warm surface temperatures and low winds aloft from this El NiÃ±o nurtured Hurricane Linda in September of 1997, allowing it to become the strongest storm ever observed in the East Pacific, with winds reaching 190 miles per hour.Hobgood said this work represents a natural next step in the research thatâs been going on for decades at the National Hurricane Center (NHC), part of the National Centers for Environmental Prediction in Miami. The work may one day help scientists predict hurricane strength.âFor the last 30 years most hurricane research has focused on prediction of where hurricanes are going to hit, and weâve gotten pretty good at it,â said Hobgood. âWe can warn people about 2 days in advance that a storm may hit their area. Now weâre trying to learn how to predict the strength of hurricanes.âNHC scientists were already investigating hurricane strength in the Atlantic, so Hobgood and Whitney decided to look at the Pacific. When they did, they noticed that hurricanes in the North Pacific have on the average grown more intense between 1963 and 1993.While the average intensity fluctuated year to year, it gradually increased over the 31 years. The minimum intensity of 32.6 percent occurred in 1964, then grew to about 50 percent in 1973, remained relatively stable until 1987 when it began to increase again, and then reached a maximum of 63.7 percent in 1990.Hobgood admits that the gradual increase in intensity may be at least partially due to an overall increase in ocean surface temperature, which may be due to global warming.âIâm not convinced that the change is entirely due to global warming,â he said. âItâs probably a combination of things, possibly including global warming.âHobgood was quick to point out that as satellite technology has improved over the years, analytical techniques have become more systematic, which could account for some of the increase in recorded intensity.Now that Hobgood and Whitney have investigated ocean surface temperature, they plan to examine the influences of other atmospheric conditions on hurricanes. Currently they are studying data collected at Socorro, a tiny volcanic island off the west coast of Mexico, an area of much hurricane activity. They are examining weather balloon information such as wind speed, humidity, and temperature, all of which contribute to hurricane incidence and strength. Hobgood presented his preliminary analyses of the Socorro data at the March 1998 meeting of the Association of American Geographers meeting in Boston.This work was supported by the Air Force Institute of Technology at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_840", "content": "Mobile homes, which were particularly hard hit in the Florida tornadoes, seemed at particular risk. But mobile homes aren't as much of a problem as are their foundations -- or lack of foundations, according to Sparks. \"The standards are quite reasonable now on mobile homes -- unfortunately, not as much care is put into actually putting the home onto a proper concrete foundation,\" said Sparks. Sparks, who testified before the U.S. House Subcommittee on Housing and Community Development in connection with mobile home standards, is a leading expert on wind damage to structures, as well as the relationship between insurance losses and wind conditions. His engineering recommendations on mobile homes helped lead to tougher industry standards. \"But there's no way that such light-weight structures can be engineered to survive these sort of winds. People need to know that and make their decisions accordingly,\" said Sparks. Clemson has the nation's only wind-load test facility built solely for the study of wind on low-rise structures such as homes and schools. Civil engineers from Clemson were part of the team that made recommendations on how to build back safer stronger homes after Hurricane Andrew hit Florida and Louisiana in August 1992. Most hurricanes continue to be \"man-made disasters,\" said Sparks, who cites construction practices and the continued proximity of houses to the ocean."}
{"doc_id": "hurricane_doc_841", "content": "The team, lead by Professor William Gray, issued a report Nov. 26 that outlined why the El NiÃ±o of 1997 flattened the team's August prediction of 11 named storms, six hurricanes and two intense hurricanes for the season. Instead, the Atlantic Basin saw seven named storms, three hurricanes and one intense hurricane during the season, which ends Nov. 30. On average, 9.3 tropical storms, 5.8 hurricanes and 2.2 intense hurricanes form annually. Although the hurricane season was below average, Gray's statistics show that the period between 1995-1997 was still the busiest three-year period for hurricane activity on record. The three-year span generated 39 named storms, 23 hurricanes (13 of which were intense) and 116 hurricane days. \"We knew going into the hurricane season that this would be an extremely difficult year to forecast,\" Gray said. \"The El NiÃ±o proved to be twice as strong as any other previous record El NiÃ±o event in history for this time of year. No one guessed that it would grow to be so intense. And yet, despite this very extreme weather event, we still saw hurricane activity--more than was to be expected.\" El NiÃ±o is a weather phenomenon marked by warmer-than-normal water temperatures in the eastern Pacific Ocean off the coast of Peru and along the equator. This rise in ocean temperatures causes strong upper tropospheric winds to blow in a westerly direction from the Pacific Ocean to the tropical Atlantic Ocean. These winds typically act to shear off developing hurricanes. Gray said that in other years with strong El NiÃ±o events, such as 1957, 1972 and 1982, waters warmed only 2 or 3 degrees centigrade above normal. But the El NiÃ±o of 1997 actually warmed waters 4 or 5 degrees centigrade above normal--nearly twice as much as the previous record El NiÃ±o of 1982-83. This rare and extreme rise in ocean temperatures helped produce even more intense westerly upper tropospheric winds in the Atlantic Basin, which caused strong wind shear and prevented most easterly waves from Africa from forming. Gray and his team of researchers are investigating the possibility that the extreme El NiÃ±o this year may have been the result of a long period of warm water accumulating in the western Pacific, possibly left over from smaller El NiÃ±o events in 1991-1993. The team contends this kind of warm water build-up could only have produced the type of El NiÃ±o that emerged this year. Despite El NiÃ±o's extreme influence over the Colorado State team's 1997 hurricane forecast, Gray points out that factors in the Atlantic favorable for hurricane activity were still enough to produce seven named storms this year. These factors included warmer sea surface temperatures in the north and tropical Atlantic and colder sea surface temperatures in the South Atlantic, as well as colder than normal air temperatures 54,000 feet above Singapore. Also present was the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation, equatorial stratospheric winds at 68,000-75,000 feet than tend to promote hurricane formation when they blow from the west--as they did this year. And, as predicted in the team's August forecast, El NiÃ±o pushed many of the storms that did form in 1997 to higher latitudes--some of them closer to the United States. Of the seven named storms that formed in the Atlantic, six originated above 25 degrees north latitude, higher latitudes than hurricanes typically form. Gray attributes this to the fact that while El NiÃ±o produces strong upper-level westerly winds at lower latitudes that block African-origin storms, it also creates weaker upper-level westerly winds at higher latitudes that are less able to thwart hurricane development. Using atmospheric models, Gray and his colleagues have shown that if the El NiÃ±o of 1997 had only been as intense as previous record El NiÃ±o events in 1957, 1972 and 1982, those positive factors for hurricane formation would have generated 10 named storms, six hurricanes and three intense hurricanes--virtually on target with the team's prediction. \"The 1997 El NiÃ±o was truly in a class by itself,\" Gray said. \"But I don't think it will be around to influence the 1998 hurricane season to any significant degree.\" The Colorado State team's historical data shows that nine out of the past 30 years have actually produced less hurricane activity than in 1997. Of the nine years that were less active, seven occurred during El NiÃ±o events. When Gray's team issues the first forecast for the 1998 season on Dec. 5, the statistical model will now include the extreme 1997 El NiÃ±o conditions. The team's hurricane forecasts--issued in early December, April, June and August--do not predict landfall and apply only to the Atlantic Basin, which encompasses the Atlantic Ocean, Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico. In addition to Gray, the hurricane research team includes John Knaff, Paul Mielke and Kenneth Berry from Colorado State; and Chris Landsea, a Colorado State graduate and a researcher at NOAA's Hurricane Research Laboratory in Miami, Fla."}

A better understanding of how the Great Lakes affect passing cyclones may allow better forecasting of these storms and their potential effects.\"Cyclones are low-pressure storm centers, \"often accompanied by high winds and heavy precipitation,\" said Scott Isard, a U. of I. professor of geography. \"The ensuing storms can be huge, ranging in size from 800 to 1,500 miles in diameter.\"To study the effect the Great Lakes have on passing cyclones, Angel and Isard examined the rates of movement and the changes in intensity for 583 cyclones that passed over the region between the years 1965 to 1990. The researchers' findings, published in the September issue of Monthly Weather Review, identify several important features regarding the lakes' influence on these storm systems.\"In general, we found that cyclones accelerated as they approached the Great Lakes region and increased in intensity over the lakes,\" Angel said. \"This effect was most pronounced from September to November, when the surface waters of the lakes are warmer than the surrounding air and can provide a major source of both moisture and heat that energizes passing storms.\"From January to March, when broken ice cover is generally present on the lakes, cyclones accelerated less and did not intensify, Angel said. However, cyclones that traversed the region during May and June did speed up and grow in strength.\"This surprised us, because the lakes are usually cooler than the overriding air mass during spring and summer, and have not generally been considered as an important energy source for cyclones at that time,\" Angel said. \"We don't yet have a satisfactory explanation for this phenomenon.\"In another study (to appear in the journal Climate), Angel and Isard analyzed trends in storm strength for the years 1900 to 1990. \"We are seeing evidence of an increase in the number of stronger storms, particularly in the months of November and December,\" Angel said.Historically, some of these cyclones have produced hurricane-force winds and caused extensive damage to shipping. The \"great storm of 1913,\" for example, sank a dozen ships and claimed more than 250 lives. More recently, the ore carrier Edmund Fitzgerald -- popularized in a ballad by Canadian singer and songwriter Gordon Lightfoot -- sank in Lake Superior during a major storm on Nov. 10, 1975. All hands were lost."}
