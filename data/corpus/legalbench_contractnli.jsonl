Remedies Without prejudice to any other rights or remedies that any Party may have, the Recipient Party acknowledges and agrees that damages alone would not be an adequate remedy for any breach by the Recipient Party of the provisions of this Agreement, and that the remedies of injunction and specific performance as well an any other equitable relief for any threatened or actual breach by the Recipient Party or its Representatives would be more appropriate remedies. 8. Entire Agreement and Variation 8.1 This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties and supersedes and extinguishes all previous drafts, agreements, arrangements and understandings between them, whether written or oral, relating to its subject matter. 8.2 No variation of this Agreement shall be effective unless it is in writing and signed by each of the Parties (or their authorised representatives). 9. No Waiver 9.1 Failure by either Party to enforce any of its rights under this Agreement shall not be taken as or deemed to be a waiver of such. 9.2 No waiver or amendment of any provisions of this Agreement shall be valid or binding against either Party unless the waiver or amendment is made in writing and signed by the duly appointed representatives of both Parties. 10. Assignment This Agreement is personal to the Parties and shall not be assigned or otherwise transferred in whole or in part by either Party without the prior written consent of the other Party. 11.

Disclosing confidential information if required to by law. Each of us may disclose the other's confidential information if required to comply with a court order or other government demand that has the force of law.

Even if no revision is possible, the rest of this agreement will remain in place. j. Entire agreement. This agreement does not grant any implied intellectual property licenses to confidential information, except as stated above. We may have contracts with each other covering other specific aspects of our relationship (\"other contracts\"). The other contract may include commitments about confidential information, either within it or by referencing another non-disclosure agreement. If so, those obligations remain in place for purposes of that other contract. With this exception, this is the entire agreement between us regarding confidential information. It replaces all other agreements and understandings regarding confidential information. We can only change this agreement with a signed document that states that it is changing this agreement."}

Initials: Other Sensitive but Unclassified (SBU) As used in this Agreement, sensitive but unclassified information is an over-arching term that covers any information, not otherwise indicated above, which the loss of, misuse of, or unauthorized access to or modification of could adversely affect the national interest or the conduct of Federal programs, or the privacy to which individuals are entitled under Section 552a of Title 5, as amended, but which has not been specifically authorized under criteria established by an Executive Order or an Act of Congress to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy. This includes information categorized by DHS or other government agencies as: For Official Use Only (FOUO); Official Use Only (OUO); Sensitive Homeland Security Information (SHSI); Limited Official Use (LOU); Law Enforcement Sensitive (LES); Safeguarding Information (SGI); Unclassified Controlled Nuclear Information (UCNI); and any other identifier used by other government agencies to categorize information as sensitive but unclassified. I attest that I am familiar with, and I will comply with the standards for access, dissemination, handling, and safeguarding of the information to which I am granted access as cited in this Agreement and in accordance with the guidance provided to me relative to the specific category of information. I understand and agree to the following terms and conditions of my access to the information indicated above: 1. I hereby acknowledge that I have received a security indoctrination concerning the nature and protection of information to which I have been provided conditional access, including the procedures to be followed in ascertaining whether other persons to whom I contemplate disclosing this information have been approved for access to it, and that I understand these procedures. 2. By being granted conditional access to the information indicated above, the United States Government has placed special confidence and trust in me and I am obligated to protect this information from unauthorized disclosure, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the laws, regulations, and directives applicable to the specifi c categories of information to which I am granted access. 3. I attest that I understand my responsibilities and that I am familiar with and will comply with the standards for protecting such information that I may have access to in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the laws, regulations, and/or directives applicable to the specifi c categories of information to which I am granted access. I understand that the United States Government may conduct inspections, at any time or place, for the purpose of ensuring compliance with the conditions for access, dissemination, handling and safeguarding information under this Agreement. 4. I will not disclose or release any information provided to me pursuant to this Agreement without proper authority or authorization. Should situations arise that warrant the disclosure or release of such information I will do so only under approved circumstances and in accordance with the laws, regulations, or directives applicable to the specific categories of information. I will honor and comply with any and all dissemination restrictions cited or verbally relayed to me by the proper authority. 5. (a) For PCII - (1) Upon the completion of my engagement as an employee, consultant, or subcontractor under the contract, or the completion of my work on the PCII Program, whichever occurs first, I will surrender promptly to the PCII Program Manager or his designee, or to the appropriate PCII officer, PCII of any type whatsoever that is in my possession. (2) If the Authorized Entity is a United States Government contractor performing services in support of the PCII Program, I will not request, obtain, maintain, or use PCII unless the PCII Program Manager or Program Manager’s designee has first made in writing, with respect to the contractor, the certification as provided for in Section 29.8(c) of the implementing regulations to the CII Act, as amended. (b) For SSI and SBU - I hereby agree that material which I have in my possession and containing information covered by this Agreement, will be handled and safeguarded in a manner that affords sufficient protection to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of or inadvertent access to such information, consistent with the laws, regulations, or directives applicable to the specific categories of information. I agree that I shall return all information to which I have had access or which is in my possession 1) upon demand by an authorized individual; and/or 2) upon the conclusion of my duties, association, or support to DHS; and/or 3) upon the determination that my official duties do not require further access to such information. 6. I hereby agree that I will not alter or remove markings, which indicate a category of information or require specific handling instructions, from any material I may come in contact with, in the case of SSI or SBU, unless such alteration or removal is consistent with the requirements set forth in the laws, regulations, or directives applicable to the specific category of information or, in the case of PCII, unless such alteration or removal is authorized by the PCII Program Manager or the PCII Program Manager’s designee. I agree that if I use information from a sensitive document or other medium, I will carry forward any markings or other required restrictions to derivative products, and will protect them in the same matter as the original. 7. I hereby agree that I shall promptly report to the appropriate official, in accordance with the guidance issued for the applicable category of information, any loss, theft, misuse, misplacement, unauthorized disclosure, or other security violation, I have knowledge of and whether or not I am personally involved. I also understand that my anonymity will be kept to the extent possible when reporting security violations. 8. If I violate the terms and conditions of this Agreement, such violation may result in the cancellation of my conditional access to the information covered by this Agreement. This may serve as a basis for denying me conditional access to other types of information, to include classified national security information. 9. (a) With respect to SSI and SBU, I hereby assign to the United States Government all royalties, remunerations, and emoluments that have resulted, will result, or may result from any disclosure, publication, or revelation of the information not consistent with the terms of this Agreement. (b) With respect to PCII I hereby assign to the entity owning the PCII and the United States Government, all royalties, remunerations, and emoluments that have resulted, will result, or may result from any disclosure, publication, or revelation of PCII not consistent with the terms of this Agreement. 10. This Agreement is made and intended for the benefit of the United States Government and may be enforced by the United States Government or the Authorized Entity. By granting me conditional access to information in this context, the United States Government and, with respect to PCII, the Authorized Entity, may seek any remedy available to it to enforce this Agreement including, but not limited to, application for a court order prohibiting disclosure of information in breach of this Agreement. I understand that if I violate the terms and conditions of this Agreement, I could be subjected to administrative, disciplinary, civil, or criminal action, as appropriate, under the laws, regulations, or directives applicable to the category of information involved and neither the United States Government nor the Authorized Entity have waived any statutory or common law evidentiary privileges or protections that they may assert in any administrative or court proceeding to protect any sensitive information to which I have been given conditional access under the terms of this Agreement. 11. Unless and until I am released in writing by an authorized representative of the Department of Homeland Security (if permissible for the particular category of information), I understand that all conditions and obligations imposed upon me by this Agreement apply during the time that I am granted conditional access, and at all times thereafter. 12. Each provision of this Agreement is severable. If a court should find any provision of this Agreement to be unenforceable, all other provisions shall remain in full force and effect. 13. My execution of this Agreement shall not nullify or affect in any manner any other secrecy or non-disclosure Agreement which I have executed or may execute with the United States Government or any of its departments or agencies. 14. These restrictions are consistent with and do not supersede, conflict with, or otherwise alter the employee obligations, rights, or liabilities created by Executive Order No. 12958, as amended; Section 7211 of Title 5, United States Code (governing disclosures to Congress); Section 1034 of Title 10, United States Code, as amended by the Military Whistleblower Protection Act (governing disclosure to Congress by members of the military); Section 2302(b)(8) of Title 5, United States Code, as amended by the Whistleblower Protection Act (governing disclosures of illegality, waste, fraud, abuse or public health or safety threats); the Intelligence Identities Protection Act of 1982 (50 USC 421 et seq.) (governing disclosures that could expose confidential Government agents); and the statutes which protect against disclosure that may compromise the national security, including Sections 641, 793, 794, 798, and 952 of Title 18, United States Code, and Section 4(b) of the Subversive Activities Act of 1950 (50 USC 783(b)). The definitions, requirements, obligations, rights, sanctions, and liabilities created by said Executive Order and listed statutes are incorporated into this agreement and are controlling. 15. Signing this Agreement does not bar disclosures to Congress or to an authorized official of an executive agency or the Department of Justice that are essential to reporting a substantial violation of law. 16. I represent and warrant that I have the authority to enter into this Agreement. 17. I have read this Agreement carefully and my questions, if any, have been answered.

The Earth monitoring competition Copernicus Masters aims to support the development of market-oriented applications based on Earth observation data. In 2017, the Copernicus Masters is again enriched by the Copernicus Accelerator, a European Commission programme. Through this initiative, the 50 best finalists of the Copernicus Masters, selected by an international expert panel will automatically be granted access to a business coaching scheme provided by high-level professionals, that will act as mentors. To actively participate in the Copernicus Accelerator programme, Mentor commits to the following Non-Disclosure-Agreement and Terms of Participation. 1 Eligibility Mentor is a resident of one of the Copernicus participating countries1 or is employed with a legal identity registered in the territory of one of the Copernicus participating countries, willing to support and help develop the Ideas of the finalists of the Copernicus Masters 2017 (hereinafter “Participants”). Professionals who pursue becoming mentors need to apply via the dedicated platform, inserting all required details, which can be edited anytime by Mentor. Their request needs to be validated by the Organiser and the European Commission, who can refuse participation in case of non-eligibility or conflict of interest. After verification of all details entered, the Organiser will notify the Mentor about the outcome of his/her submission. Even after validation, the Organiser cannot guarantee that there will be an actual match between Mentor and Participants. Mentor confirms that Mentor has not been involved in the development of any of the Ideas to be coached at any stage and that Mentor has no personal or commercial connection to any Participant of the Copernicus Accelerator that would influence an objective development of Ideas. 1 The Copernicus Participating countries include all the EU Member States, in addition to Norway and Iceland. 2 Procedure and Terms of Participation The Copernicus Accelerator programme is comprised of different phases, for a total coaching support of approximately one year, aimed at helping Participants´ Ideas achieving measurable results. When submitting the request to become Mentor, Mentor needs to specify in which fields he/she can support Participants, in order to allow a suitable matchmaking with the requests and needs communicated by Participants. When a Mentor is requested by a Participant of the programme, he/she can access the Participant's profile and examine the submitted idea, in order to decide whether to confirm the request or not. Mentors can only advise up to two participants. Mentors will meet the Participants at the Accelerator Bootcamp, that will take place in line with the Awards Ceremony of the Copernicus Masters, the European Satellite Navigation Competition (ESNC), and the accompanying Satellite Masters Conference from 6 - 8 November 2017 in Tallinn, Estonia. Mentor´s participation to this event is mandatory, as it will set forth the official start of their relationship: Mentor and Participants will begin developing a coaching plan together, that will include objectives and KPIs of their affiliation. Monthly virtual interactions need to be planned by Mentor, to ensure a continuous acceleration of the Participants Ideas´ towards business maturity. A mid-term review and survey will be required by April 2018, to evaluate progress made and ensure that the recommendations of the coaching plan are currently implemented by Participants. In case of a non-positive matching or non-compliance to his/her assigned duties (having monthly interactions with the mentees, keeping contacts with the Copernicus Accelerator team, promptly informing the organizers about any relevant issue connected to the coaching relationship), Mentor may be replaced by a more suitable candidate for the Participants´ needs. Mentor will actively support Participants until July 2018, and will then submit a final report together, detailing the outcome of the coaching experience. The Organiser will continuously monitor all relationships, in order to assist both parties and guarantee a positive outcome of the programme. Mentor needs to deliver all requested reports and schedule all requested meetings. The Organiser will provide Mentor with templates for the documents to be produced. Mentors and Participants will meet again at the closing bootcamp, held in October/November 2018, that will official seal the closing of their mentoring relationship. At the end of the coaching service, Mentor will fill in a questionnaire on the coaching service and the overall experience and will also be subject to a specific questionnaire compiled by Participants. 3 Payment The Organiser will reimburse Mentor the travel arrangements and accommodation for the Acceleration Bootcamp in Tallinn in 2017 (a maximum of EUR 800) and the closing bootcamp in 2018 (a maximum of EUR 700). The coaching service provided by Mentor is worth a maximum fee of EUR 5,000 (VAT excluded) per Participant coached, that will be remunerated to Mentor at the end of the programme, after the submission and approval of the final summary report of the coaching relationships. Payment shall be made within 30 days from the receipt of invoice, and following the invoice verification by Organiser. No deductions will be made from the gross fees paid to mentor who shall be solely responsible for ensuring that all and any Government taxes and other deductions are paid by him/her. 4 Definition of Confidential Information “Confidential Information” means any Idea disclosed to Mentor, all data and information, know-how, business concepts, software, procedures, products, services, development projects, and programmes contained in such Idea and/or its description and any conclusions. Confidential Information does not include: > information already known or independently developed by Mentor prior to the disclosure of any Idea; > information already in the public domain through no wrongful act of Mentor; or > information received from a third party who was free to disclose such information. In case of doubt any information is deemed to be Confidential Information unless Mentor proves that such information is not confidential. 5 Non-Disclosure of Confidential Information / Obligations of Mentor Mentor shall not use any Confidential Information for any purpose except to review, assess and help develop the Participants´ Ideas. Mentor shall not disclose any Confidential Information to any third party or to Mentor’s employees and/or employer without the prior written consent of the Participants.

Mentor shall take all reasonable measures to protect the secrecy of, and avoid any unauthorised disclosure or use of Confidential Information. Such measures shall include the highest degree of care that Mentor utilises to protect Mentor’s own confidential information of a similar nature, but no less than reasonable care.

Mentor shall notify Organiser immediately in writing of any misuse or misappropriation of any Confidential Information that may come to Mentor’s attention.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Mentor shall disclose Confidential Information only to the minimum extent required to comply with such order. 8 Proprietary Rights, Limited Right to Use Any and all proprietary rights, including but not limited to rights to and in inventions, patent rights, utility models, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, in and to any Confidential Information shall be and remain with the Participants respectively, and Mentor shall not have any right, license, title or interest in or to any Confidential Information, except the limited right to review, assess and help develop such Confidential Information in connection with the Copernicus Accelerator 2017. 9 Term This Agreement shall be effective as of 2 May 2017 and may not be terminated except for important cause. Notwithstanding the termination of this Agreement, any Confidential Information must be kept confidential for as long as such Confidential Information is not publicly known unless it becomes part of the public domain through no wrongful act of Mentor. This agreement may not be changed or modified, except by an agreement in writing, signed by both parties. 10 Governing Law This Agreement and the rights and obligations of the parties hereunder shall be governed by the material laws of the Federal Republic of Germany. 11 Jurisdiction The place of jurisdiction for any and all legal disputes arising out of or in connection with this Agreement is Munich (Landgericht München I). Imperative places of jurisdiction under German Law shall remain unaffected by the foregoing. 12 Notification of Unauthorised Use Mentor shall notify Organiser immediately upon discovery of any unauthorised use or disclosure of Confidential Information or any other breach of this Agreement by Mentor, and will cooperate with Organiser in every reasonable way to help Organiser regain possession of the Confidential Information and prevent its further unauthorised use or publication. 13 Remedies Mentor acknowledges that his/her obligations under this Agreement are necessary and reasonable in order to protect the Ideas and the Confidential Information. Each party further acknowledges that any breach by Mentor of Mentor’s covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement or threatened violation of such may cause irreparable injury to Organiser and to Participants. 14 Miscellaneous This Agreement shall be binding upon Organiser and Mentor, and their successors and assigns. This Agreement contains the entire agreement and understanding of the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior discussions, agreements and understandings of every nature between them. This Agreement may not be changed or modified, except by an agreement in writing, signed by both of the parties. The failure or delay on the part of either party to exercise any right under this Agreement shall not be deemed a waiver of any rights under this Agreement. Mentor is aware that an unauthorised disclosure of the Ideas and of the assessment and development of the Ideas and of any Confidential Information may lead to serious damage to Participants and the Organiser of the Copernicus Accelerator 2017. This Agreement shall be for the benefit of the Participants. The Organiser and the European Commission will use the Mentor´s contact information to inform him/her of all matters related to the Copernicus Accelerator 2017 and of any other issues the Organiser and the European Commission deem relevant and appropriate. The failure or delay on the part of either party to exercise any right under this agreement shall not be deemed a waiver of any rights under this agreement."}

In the event IBC elects to utilize a development tool in the future that would require the provision of redistributable code that is subject to licensing requirements then the applicable EULA will be provided to Vendor in conjunction with the provision of any applicable compiled software code containing redistributable code generated using such development tool.

It includes a prohibition against the use of any portion of the PMS Software that is developed in reliance upon the Confidential Information for the provision of services relating to practice management to third parties. f. It otherwise complies with all of the requirements contained in an applicable EULA provided by or identified by IBC. 3. Remedies Vendor acknowledges that monetary damages would not be a sufficient remedy for unauthorized disclosure of Confidential Information and that IBC shall be entitled, without waiving any other rights or remedies, to such injunctive or equitable relief as may be deemed proper by a court of competent jurisdiction, without the necessity of proving actual damages or posting any bonds. Vendor agrees to defend any and all Claims that may be brought or alleged against IBC and/or its respective directors, officers, employees, agents or contractors, and indemnify and hold harmless IBC and its respective directors, officers, employees, agents and contractors, from and against any and all Claims or damages that may arise, by reason of any breach of this Agreement by Vendor, its personnel or contractors or from Vendor’s use of the Confidential Information including any deficiency in or other issue relating to the use or distribution of that portion of the PMS System that is developed using the Confidential Information. For any Claims that IBC chooses to defend, the Vendor shall, to the extent requested by IBC, participate in and co-operate with and assist IBC in such defence and any related settlement negotiations. 4. Miscellaneous (a) All Confidential Information, and all associated intellectual property rights therein, are and shall remain the exclusive property of IBC and its licensors.

Vendor is solely responsible for ensuring that the Confidential Information is suitable for the Vendor’s needs. WITH RESPECT TO THE HCAI SYSTEM, THE SERVICES, OR ANY CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION, IBC EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY WARRANTIES, REPRESENTATIONS OR CONDITIONS, IMPLIED OR EXPRESS, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY WARRANTY OR CONDITION OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT. (c) IBC has or expects to enter into service agreements directly with Providers that will govern such Provider’s access to and use of the HCAI System. However, IBC does not guarantee availability or operation of the HCAI System to Vendor. Without prejudice to any right an individual Provider may have against IBC, IBC shall have no liability to Vendor in respect of any failure or problem in the operation of the HCAI System, including any communication problems between Providers and the HCAI System. IN NO EVENT WILL THE MEASURE OF DAMAGES PAYABLE BY EITHER PARTY INCLUDE, NOR WILL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE FOR, ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES DUE TO BUSINESS INTERRUPTION OR LOST PROFITS, SAVINGS, COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE OR GOODWILL) ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION AND/OR THE OPERATION OF THE HCAI SYSTEM, REGARDLESS OF THE TYPE OF CLAIM, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING FUNDAMENTAL BREACH OR FAILURE OF THE ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY REMEDY CONTAINED HEREIN), NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY, WHETHER OR NOT FORESEEABLE, AND REGARDLESS OF THE CAUSE OF SUCH DAMAGES EVEN IF THE PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES IN ADVANCE. IBC’S LIABILITY FOR ANY MATTER RELATING TO OR ARISING FROM THIS AGREEMENT, THE CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION AND/OR THE OPERATION OF THE HCAI SYSTEM, WHETHER BASED UPON AN ACTION OR CLAIM IN CONTRACT, WARRANTY, EQUITY, TORT, NEGLIGENCE, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL NOT EXCEED, IN THE AGGREGATE AND IN RESPECT OF ALL ACTIONS, CLAIMS AND DAMAGES, AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS. (d) This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. It shall not be modified except by a written agreement dated subsequent to the date of this Agreement and signed by both parties. None of the provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed to have been waived by any act or acquiescence on the part of IBC, the Vendor, their agents, or employees, but only by an instrument in writing signed by an authorized employee of IBC and the Vendor. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement shall constitute a waiver of any other provision(s) or of the same provision on another occasion. No employee, agent or representative of IBC is authorized to make any additional representation, warranty or covenant on behalf of IBC. (e) If either party employs lawyers to enforce any rights arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover reasonable lawyers’ fees and costs. This Agreement shall be construed and controlled by the laws in force in the Province of Ontario, and the parties further consent to non-exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the federal or provincial courts sitting in Toronto, Ontario. Vendor waives all defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction and forum non conveniens. Process may be served on either party in the manner authorized by applicable law or court rule. (f) This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of each party’s respective successors and lawful assigns; provided, however, that Vendor may not assign this Agreement (whether by operation of law, sale of securities or assets, merger or otherwise), in whole or in part, without the prior written approval of IBC. Any purported assignment in violation of this Section shall be void. HCAI may assign this Agreement to any entity which acquires responsibility for the operation of the HCAI System. (g) If any provision of this Agreement shall be held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect. (h) IBC may terminate this Agreement with or without cause upon thirty (30) days prior written notice to the Vendor. IBC will not exercise such discretion to terminate the Agreement with a specific vendor except for commercially reasonable grounds. All sections of this Agreement relating to the rights and obligations of the parties concerning Confidential Information disclosed during the term of the Agreement shall survive any such termination. Upon any termination of this Agreement, Vendor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to, as promptly as is practical, remove any functionality incorporated in the PMS System that is based on the Confidential Information. (i) The parties confirm that each has read this Agreement in its entirety, that the Agreement is being entered into without undue influence or fraud or coercion or misrepresentation whatsoever, that each has had independent legal advice, that each understands its respective rights and obligations under this Agreement, and that this Agreement is being executed voluntarily. (j) It is the express wish of the parties that this Agreement and all related documents be drawn up in English. C’est la volonté expresse des parties que la présente convention ainsi que les documents qui s’y rattachent soient rédigés en anglais.

Recipient will be responsible for any breach of the terms of this Agreement caused by its Representatives. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Disclosing Party acknowledges and agrees that (a) the Recipient is expressly authorized to disclose the Confidential Information to certain lenders and investors, in furtherance of Recipient’s performance of its obligations with respect to the Purpose and (b) under no circumstances will Recipient have any liability for any disclosure by such lenders or investors of any of the Confidential Information. 4.

Required Disclosures. In the event that law, legal process, court order or any governmental or regulatory authority requires the Receiving Company or any of its Representatives to disclose all or any portion of the Confidential Information, the Receiving Company or such Representative may do so; provided that it shall immediately provide written notice to Owner of the required disclosure, unless such notice is prohibited by law, so that Owner may have an opportunity to seek an appropriate protective order. The Receiving Company and its Representatives agree to cooperate with any reasonable request of Owner in its efforts to secure such protective order or other appropriate remedy. If Owner is unable to obtain such protective order or other appropriate remedy, the Receiving Company or its Representatives shall furnish only that portion of the Confidential Information which the Receiving Company or its Representatives are advised in writing by counsel is required by law to be furnished and shall exercise their reasonable efforts to obtain assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded such Confidential Information. 4.

No Representations or Warranties; No License. (a) Neither Owner nor any of its Representatives has made or makes any representation or warranty as to (i) the accuracy, quality or completeness of the Information or (ii) the presence, quality or quantity of oil, gas or other hydrocarbons or the expected results of exploration, production or marketing activities. The Receiving Company agrees that neither Owner nor any of its Representatives shall have any liability to the Receiving Company or any of its Representatives resulting directly or indirectly from the Receiving Company’s use of the Information. For the purposes of this Section 5(a), “Information” is deemed to include, without limitation, any and all Confidential Information and other information and data furnished by Owner or any of Owner’s Representatives, whether or not such information is Confidential Information as defined in Section 2. (b) Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as granting any rights to the Receiving Company or any of its Representatives under any patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret, or other intellectual property right of Owner, nor shall this Agreement be construed to grant to the Receiving Company or any of its Representatives any licenses or other rights in or to the Confidential Information except the limited right to review the Confidential Information solely for the purposes of determining whether to enter into the Transaction. Nothing contained in this Agreement is intended to confer upon the Receiving Company or its Representatives any right whatsoever to any interest Owner has or may have in the Properties. 6. Return of Information. The Confidential Information shall remain the property of Owner, and the written Confidential Information, except for that portion of the Confidential Information that is contained in analyses, compilations, studies or other documents prepared by or for the Receiving Company in connection with the Transaction, shall be destroyed or returned to Owner immediately upon its request, and no copies shall be retained by the Receiving Company or its Representatives, unless the Parties agree otherwise; provided, however, that any Confidential Information contained in back-up computer records may be retained for such period required for compliance purposes if required by law, rule or regulation; provided further, that such Confidential Information shall continue to be subject to the confidentiality, non-disclosure and non-use obligations contained in this Agreement until returned in accordance with this Section 6. That portion of the Confidential Information that may be found in analyses, compilations, studies or other documents prepared by or for the Receiving Company or its Representatives, oral or visual Confidential Information, and written Confidential Information not so returned shall be destroyed (such destruction to be certified promptly in writing to Owner by an authorized officer of the Receiving Company). 7.

Equitable Relief. The Receiving Company acknowledges and agrees that Owner may be irreparably injured, such that money damages alone may not be adequate remedy, and will be entitled to equitable relief (including, without limitation, the granting of specific performance and injunctive relief in Owner’s favor), if the Receiving Company or any person to whom the Receiving Company discloses any Confidential Information breaches or threatens to breach the terms of this Agreement. The Receiving Company agrees that equitable relief is not exclusive of other remedies to which Owner may be entitled at law or in equity. The Receiving Company further agrees to waive, and cause its Representatives to waive, any requirement for securing or posting any bond in connection with the pursuit of any such remedy. 9. No Obligation to Consummate Transaction. Nothing in this Agreement shall in any manner obligate either Party to proceed with the Transaction, whether on the terms suggested by the Receiving Company, or on any other terms.

Accordingly, Owner may elect at any time to terminate further access to and review of the Confidential Information, at which time the obligations of the Receiving Company contained in Section 6 above shall be applicable.

No Solicitation. Until the expiration of one year from the Effective Date, or until the execution of a definitive agreement between the Parties regarding a Transaction that addresses solicitation of employees, whichever is earlier, the Receiving Company shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, (a) directly or indirectly recruit (including as a director or consultant), solicit (including by contracting through an independent contractor, consultant or other third party) or otherwise induce any director, officer, employee or consultant of Owner or its Affiliates to terminate his or her directorship, employment or consultancy, as the case may be, or (b) hire or assist another person or entity in hiring or engaging as a consultant any officer, employee or consultant of Owner or its Affiliates.

{"doc_id": "legalbench_contractnli_doc_58", "content": "____________________________, 2017 ____________________________ Attention: _____________________ Dear Sir/Madam: Re: Possible Transaction between ______________________________ (“Recipient”) and Red River Oil Inc. (“Disclosing Party”) This agreement (the “Confidentiality Agreement\") establishes the terms and conditions under which the Disclosing Party will provide Recipient with Evaluation Material (as hereinafter defined) concerning the Disclosing Party. The party disclosing Evaluation Material will be referred to as the “Disclosing Party\" and the party receiving Evaluation Material will be referred to as the “Recipient\". The parties agree that the Evaluation Material is being provided by the Disclosing Party only with respect to a potential business transaction between the Disclosing Party and the Recipient (the “Transaction\"). The Disclosing Party has agreed to provide the Recipient access to the Evaluation Material subject to entering into this Confidentiality Agreement setting forth the terms and conditions pursuant to which the Evaluation Material will be provided to the Recipient, including the Recipient’s directors, officers, employees, agents, counsel, consultants and other representatives (collectively, “Representatives\"). In consideration of the Disclosing Party furnishing Evaluation Material to the Recipient for the Transaction, each party agrees on behalf of itself, its affiliates and representatives as follows: Wheresoever used in this Agreement, the following terms shall bear the respective definitions hereinafter given, namely: “Affiliate” and “Subsidiary” have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Business Corporations Act (Alberta); “Evaluation” means an evaluation of the properties, assets, operations and finances of the Disclosing Party made or to be made in contemplation of a Transaction by the Recipient; “Evaluation Material” means all information (including information in the form not only of written information but also information which may be transmitted orally, visually or by any other means) provided to the Recipient by the Disclosing Party or any of its Representatives relating to the Disclosing Party its direct and indirect, subsidiaries and their business, affairs, financial position, assets, operations and activities including, without limitation, information provided for inspection in any data room and all reports, evaluations, notes, analysis, documents, geological, engineering, geophysical and/or land maps or data, financials, trade secrets or any other documents or information pertaining in any way whatsoever to the Disclosing Party and its direct and indirect subsidiaries, together with all analysis, evaluations, compilations, notes, studies or other documents prepared by the Recipient or its Representatives containing or based upon, in whole or in part, such information or reflecting the review of, or interest in the Disclosing Party or the Transaction and includes all information, if any, previously made available to the Recipient or its Representatives; provided that Evaluation Materials will not include any information which: (i) at the time of its disclosure to the Recipient is, or thereafter becomes, generally available to, and known by the public (other than as a result of a disclosure directly or indirectly by the Recipient or its Representatives); (ii) was available to the Recipient on a non-confidential basis from a source other than the Disclosing Party provided that such source is not and was not, to the knowledge of the Recipient after due inquiry, bound by a confidentiality agreement with the Recipient to hold or retain such information confidential; or (iii) has been independently acquired or developed by the Recipient without violating any of its obligations under this or any other agreement the Recipient may have with any Person; “Person” means any natural or legal person, including a corporation, trust or partnership; and “Term” means a period of 12 months commencing on the date of this Confidentiality Agreement. Where any word or term is used herein in the singular or neuter, the same shall include the plural or masculine or feminine as the context may require. 1. Non-Disclosure: Without the prior written consent of the Disclosing Party, the Recipient will not, and will direct its Representatives not to, disclose to any Person other than its Representatives: (i) the fact that any investigations, discussions or negotiations are taking place concerning a possible Transaction; (ii) that the Recipient has requested or received Evaluation Material; (iii) any opinion or comment in respect of the Evaluation Material; or (iv) any of the terms, conditions or any facts with respect to such possible Transaction, including the status thereof. 2.

Safeguard and Representatives: The Recipient will safeguard and strictly control the dissemination of the Evaluation Material and not release or disclose any Evaluation Material to any Person, other than its Representatives and in each case only those Representatives who need to receive such information in connection with its Evaluation and who have first been informed of, and agreed to be bound by, the terms of this Agreement. The Recipient agrees to be responsible for any breach of this Agreement by any of its Representatives or by any other person to whom the Recipient has provided Evaluation Material and shall, upon request, forthwith provide to the Disclosing Party a list of all parties to whom Evaluation Material has been provided. 4. Return or Destruction of Evaluation Materials: The Recipient will keep a record of the location of any Evaluation Material provided to the Recipient. Promptly upon the Disclosing Party’s request, the Recipient will and will cause its Representatives to: (i) return to the Disclosing Party all Evaluation Material furnished to the Recipient or its Representatives, without retaining copies or other reproductions, reports, extracts, notes or other memoranda thereof (whether electronic, magnetic or otherwise); (ii) destroy or have destroyed all reproductions, memoranda, notes, reports, extracts, compilations, analyses and documents and all documents prepared by or in the possession of the Recipient or its Representatives related to the information contained in the Evaluation Material but which does not itself constitute Evaluation Material; and (iii) provide to the Disclosing Party an officer’s certificate that the terms and conditions of this paragraph have been complied with. It is understood that neither this Agreement nor the disclosure of any Evaluation Material to the Recipient should be construed as granting to the Recipient or any of its Representatives any licence or rights in respect of any part of the Evaluation Material. Furthermore, it is acknowledged that the Recipient’s computer system may automatically back-up Evaluation Material disclosed to it under the Agreement. To the extent that such computer back-up procedures create copies of the Evaluation Material, Recipient may retain such copies in its archival or back-up computer storage for the period it normally archives backed-up computer records, which copies shall be subject to the provision of this Agreement until the same are destroyed, and shall not be accessed by Recipient during such period of archival or back-up storage other than as might be required by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the destruction or return of the Evaluation Material, Recipient and its Representatives will continue to be bound by the obligations of confidentially and all other obligations hereunder during the term of this Agreement. 5. Liability and Indemnity: Without limitation and in addition to any other rights the Disclosing Party may have against the Recipient or arising by reason of any breach hereof, the Recipient shall: (a) be liable to the Disclosing Party, for any and all direct losses, costs, damages and expenses whatsoever (including legal, accounting and other professional costs, expenses, fees and disbursements, with legal fees on a solicitor-client basis) which the Disclosing Party may suffer, sustain, pay or incur; and (b) indemnify and hold harmless the Disclosing Party against all actions, proceedings, claims, demands, losses, costs, damages and expenses whatsoever which may be brought against or suffered by the Disclosing Party or which it may sustain, pay or incur, resulting or arising, directly or indirectly, from disclosure of any part of the Evaluation Material contrary to the provisions hereof or any other breach of this Agreement by the Recipient or its Representatives. The Recipient acknowledges and agrees that the Disclosing Party is constituted as trustee of its covenants under this paragraph 5 for the benefit of the Disclosing Party’s Representatives and that the Disclosing Party or its Representatives shall be entitled to enforce such covenants on behalf of such persons. 6. Physical Access: Should the Recipient or its Representatives be provided physical access to any facilities of the Disclosing Party, the Recipient hereby waives and shall cause its Representatives to waive any and all claims against the Disclosing party and all of its related parties in respect to a claim for injury or death. Further, the Recipient and its Representatives will indemnify the Disclosing Party and its Representatives for any damage as a result of such access. 7. Compelled Disclosure: Should the Recipient or its Representatives be required by law, securities regulation or policy or be requested by legal process or regulatory authority to disclose any Evaluation Material or any matter referred to herein, the Recipient will provide the Disclosing Party with prompt notice of such requirement or request so that the Disclosing Party may seek an appropriate protection order, or waive compliance with any of the provisions of this Agreement, or both. If, in the absence of either a protective order or a waiver by the Disclosing Party, the Recipient or its Representatives, in the reasonable written opinion of its legal counsel, are required by law, securities regulation or policy to disclose any Evaluation Material or such other matter, the Recipient or its Representatives may, without liability hereunder, disclose that portion, and only that portion, of the Evaluation Material or such other matter that the Recipient or its Representatives are required so to disclose and the Recipient will exercise its reasonable efforts in such event to obtain reliable assurance that the Evaluation Material or such other matter will be accorded confidential treatment. 8. Non-Solicitation: The Recipient will not, and the Recipient will cause its Representatives not to, solicit for hire or employment, directly or indirectly, any officer or employee of the Disclosing Party or its direct and indirect subsidiaries that the Recipient becomes aware of or is in contact with in connection with its evaluation of a Transaction. For the purposes of this clause, “solicitation\" shall not include solicitation of any officer or employee of the Disclosing Party or its direct and indirect subsidiaries who is solicited: (i) by advertising in a newspaper or periodical of general circulation; or (ii) indirectly through a personnel search agency engaged by the Recipient generally (not specifically in respect of the Disclosing Party) provided that the Recipient shall not pursue hiring of any officer or employee of the Disclosing Party or its direct and indirect subsidiaries once the Recipient is advised that such person is an officer or employee of the Disclosing Party; provided that this paragraph 8 shall cease to bind the Recipient on the expiry of the Term. 9. No Representation or Warranty: The Recipient understands and acknowledges that neither the Disclosing Party nor its Representatives are making any representation or warranty, expressed or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of the Evaluation Material and neither the Disclosing Party nor its Representatives or any of their respective officers, directors, employees or agents will have any liability whatsoever to the Recipient or to any other Person resulting from its use of the Evaluation Material and that the Recipient is and will be relying upon its own investigations, due diligence and analysis in evaluating and satisfying itself as to all matters relating to the Disclosing Party, its direct and indirect subsidiaries and their business, affairs and assets. Only such representations or warranties that are contained in a definitive agreement with respect to a Transaction, when as and if executed and subject to such conditions or limitations or restrictions as may therein be specified, shall have any legal effect. 10. Forecasts and Interpretations: Without restricting the generality of the provisions of paragraph 9, the Recipient acknowledges that the Evaluation Material may include estimates, forecasts, evaluations, assessments, interpretations, projections and other material, the accuracy of which will depend on the future operations of the Disclosing Party, and the Recipient acknowledges and agrees that no representation or warranty is made respecting the accuracy of such material. 11.

Confidentiality Policy 1.1 The purpose of this agreement is to ensure that confidential matters brought before the Members of the Board of SAMED or any of its committees, are not disclosed until disclosure is properly authorized. SAMED Board and Committee members are in positions of trust towards SAMED as a voluntary membership organization, and such trust may require that elected and appointed persons act with the highest integrity and keep certain information confidential, and avoid conflicts of interest. 1.2 This agreement is designed to provide clarity for each Board Member and Committee Member with regard to confidential matters that come before- or arise out of meetings and matters of the Members of the Board of SAMED or any of its committees, and provides certainty as to how situations of conflict of interest are to be handled. 1.3 Its objective is to address matters of confidentiality in a manner that facilitates the Board, and Committees in maintaining the highest business and ethical standards, protects the integrity of SAMED, the Board, and Committees, allows for appropriate levels of transparency and accountability in matters before the Board, and supports the maintenance of effective relationships among Board Members, SAMED and Committee Members. 2. Definitions 2.1 “Agreement” means this Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure Agreement 2.2 \"Board\" means the Board of SAMED. 2.3 “Board Members” means members of the Board. 2.4 “Chair” means Chair of the Board. 2.5 \"Committee\" means a committee of the Board. 2.6 \"Committee Members\" means members of any Committee. 2.7 \"Meeting\" means a meeting of the Board or a Committee, as applicable. 2.8 \"Policy\" means this Confidentiality Policy 2.9 “SAMED” means South African Medical Devices Industry Association 2.10 “Vice-Chair”, means Vice-Chair of the Board 3. The information 3.1 \"Information\" shall for the purposes of this agreement include, without limitation, any technical, commercial, scientific information, know-how, trade secrets, processes, machinery, designs, drawings, technical specifications, clients, prospects, historical and forecast financial information, organisational and operational structure and data in whatever form, communicated to the receiving party or acquired by the receiving party from the disclosing party during the course of the parties' association with one another. 4. Confidentiality 4.1 Regular Board meetings are, in the ordinary course of events, not open to the public and/or media. a) Members of SAMED may on invitation attend Board meetings. b) Once the Board has dealt with an issue in a board meeting and has decided on that matter, the issue is considered to be accessible to members to the extent of that decision. Matters that are so declared may be accessible to the public at large to the extent so declared by the Board. c) All decisions that would be accessible to the general membership and/or the public at large will be recorded as such in the Board minutes. d) If no recordal is made, the matter, discussions and all resolutions should be deemed to be confidential unless declared by the Board by resolution as not confidential. e) When considering whether matters are confidential or not, the nature of SAMED as a membership organization, the prospects of harm to SAMED (including harm to its reputation, good processes and procedures and good governance), as well as the impact of any such decision on members or groups of members, must, amongst others, be considered. 4.2 The Board also holds in-camera meetings, All present at any in-camera meeting will be bound to keep the proceedings confidential, unless otherwise directed by the Chairperson of the Board of Directors or any committee created by it with a support of the majority. Exiting and re-entering an in camera session will be permitted with the understanding that all present are obligated to keep the proceedings confidential. 4.3 Non-members will be permitted to attend an in-camera session of the Board of Directors or any Committee created by it, only after a motion requesting attendance to an in camera session is approved by a majority vote of members present and voting. External consultants present during such in camera sessions may be required to preserve the confidentiality of discussions during such a session. 4.4 If any person in attendance at a meeting of the Board of Directors or any Committee created by it, held in-camera, shall give notice of their intention not to be bound by the provisions of this by-law of SAMED, and refuse to leave the room when requested to do so, the Chair shall, subject to a resolution of the board supported by a majority vote, adjourn the meeting, after having informed members that it will be reconvened at a time and place of which the offending person will not be notified. 4.5 Committees are advisory to the Board. Only the full Board makes formal decisions. Committee meetings are held in-camera, and their recommendations should not be discussed outside of the Committee or the Board. Discussions with others for the purpose of gathering input for committee consideration are acceptable and each Committee chair would have to exercise discretion and communication that decision to all present during a Committee meeting where an external person is present. 5. Conflict of Interest 5.1 A conflict of interest arises when there is a relationship which exists which could result in the Board or Committee member being perceived as being biased either for or against the topic of discussion. 5.2 Any Member of the SAMED Board, Executive, and/or Staff who has a personal interest, directly or indirectly, in any contract, transaction, proposed contract, or proposed transaction, under consideration of the Board of Directors or of a Committee created by it shall be deemed as being in a conflict of interest, where: a) Contract is defined as any written or verbal agreement between two or more parties for the doing or not doing of something specified which is related to the matter at hand. b) Transaction is defined as an exchange of money, services, goods, position, or favours are exchanged for money, services, goods, position or favours. c) Interest is defined as any instance where any contract or transaction, proposed contract or proposed transaction could be to the benefit or detriment of themselves, family, partners, roommates/housemates, other organizations to which they are currently affiliated, that do not pertain to their job description or mandate. 5.3 Conflicts of interest may also arise in matters that may lead to a direct benefit to a particular Board member and/or his/her company, which position may conflict with either the law and/or codes of good practice and/or SAMED policy on a particular matter or the approach that should be taken to specific types of matters. 5.4 Where the Board of Directors or a Committee created by it is of the opinion that a conflict of interest exists that has not been declared, the Board of Directors or Committee may declare, by a resolution carried by two-thirds of the members present and voting at the meeting, that a conflict of interest exists and that the member found in conflict shall follow the procedure below. 5.5 In the event of a conflict of interest, the interested party shall: a) Prior to any vote on the issue, declare the conflict of interest to the Chair or Board as a whole. b) Refrain from voting in relation to the matter. c) Withdraw from the meeting when the matter is discussed if requested to do so by a simple majority of the members present and voting at the meeting. 6.

{"doc_id": "legalbench_contractnli_doc_63", "content": "CONFIDENTIAL MUTUAL NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT This MUTUAL NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT (this \"Agreement\") is entered into as of September 11, 2013 by and between Sony Pictures Television Inc., having a place of business at 10202 West Washington Boulevard, Culver City, California 90232 (\"Sony Pictures\"), and Tribune Company, having its principal place of business at 435 North Michigan Avenue, Chicago, Illinois 60611 (\"Company\"). WHEREAS, Sony Pictures and Company wish to have discussions regarding potential business opportunities, including the possibility of Sony Pictures producing programming for Company affiliated stations and acquiring equity in Company (the \"Potential Transaction\"); and accordingly wish to disclose to and receive from each other, from time to time during the term of this Agreement, certain confidential and proprietary information regarding their respective businesses; NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of such disclosures and the agreements and covenants herein contained, each of Sony Pictures and Company agrees as follows: 1. Definition of Confidential Information. “Confidential Information” shall mean all information disclosed, directly or indirectly, through any means of communication or observation, by or on behalf of one party hereto (the \"Disclosing Party\") to the other party hereto (the \"Receiving Party\") on or after the date hereof, that relates to or is derived from the Disclosing Party’s business, strategic, marketing, technological or creative affairs, or to any other matter that the Receiving Party is advised or has reason to know is the confidential or proprietary information of the Disclosing Party. Any material provided by either party to the other which is clearly designated \"Confidential\" (or other similar legend) will be presumed to be Confidential Information; the absence of any such legend, however, will not preclude the same from being deemed Confidential Information. 2. Exceptions to Confidential Information. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, \"Confidential Information\" does not include information which: (a) is or becomes generally known or available to the public through no act or failure to act by the Receiving Party or its Representatives (as defined below) in breach of this Agreement; (b) is or becomes known to the Receiving Party from a third party who, to the knowledge of the Receiving Party after reasonable investigation, owes no legal or contractual obligation of confidentiality to the Disclosing Party; or (c) is or was developed independently by or for the Receiving Party, without use of or reference to any Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party and without violation of any obligation contained herein. 3. Protection of Confidential Information. Each party, as a Receiving Party, agrees that it will: (a) not use, or authorize the use of, such Confidential Information for any purpose other than for the evaluation, negotiation and, if applicable, consummation of the Potential Transaction; (b) other than as permitted by Section 4 of this Agreement, hold such Confidential Information in strict confidence and protect such Confidential Information with the same degree of care (but in no event less than a reasonable degree of care) such party normally uses to protect its own information that is similar in type or nature to the Confidential Information; (c) not disclose such Confidential Information to any person other than to those of its and/or its affiliated companies’ respective employees, stockholders, partners, members, directors, officers, advisors, agents, accountants, attorneys, representatives and/or consultants (collectively, “Representatives”), in each case, who (i) need to know such Confidential Information to facilitate the evaluation, negotiation and, if applicable, consummation of the Potential Transaction, and (ii) are advised of the confidential and proprietary nature of such Confidential Information and are bound by confidentiality obligations (which may be contained in such Representatives’ engagement agreements) that limit the further use and disclosure of such Confidential Information; (d) not copy or reproduce all or any part of such Confidential Information in any medium, except as may be strictly necessary to facilitate the use of Confidential Information as permitted by this Agreement; and (e) not decompile, disassemble or reverse engineer all or any part of such Confidential Information. For the avoidance of doubt, any use of the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information by any Representative of the Receiving Party must be in strict accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Without limiting any obligations of the Receiving Party under this Agreement, the Receiving Party shall be responsible for any breaches of this Agreement by its Representatives. 4. Disclosure Compelled by Law or Judicial Proceeding. In the event that the Receiving Party is required to disclose any portion of any Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party (i) by operation of law or in connection with a judicial or governmental proceeding or arbitration (whether by oral questions, interrogatories, requests for information, subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar process), (ii) pursuant to the rules or regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (or any other applicable securities regulatory body) or (iii) pursuant to the rules or regulations of any securities exchange on which the Receiving Party’s or its parent company’s securities are listed or similar self-regulatory body, then such disclosure will be permissible only if and after the Receiving Party promptly notifies the Disclosing Party of such requirement (to the extent legally permitted) so that the Disclosing Party (at its sole cost and expense) may seek an appropriate protective order or other appropriate remedy and/or waive compliance with the provisions of this Agreement. In no event will the Receiving Party or any of its Representatives oppose any action by the Disclosing Party to obtain an appropriate protective order or assurance of confidential treatment to preserve the confidentiality of any such Confidential Information. If as a result of any such requirement the Receiving Party is required to disclose Confidential Information or the existence, content or status of negotiations relating to the specific transactions contemplated by the Potential Transaction, the Receiving Party may furnish, without liability hereunder, that portion (and only that portion) of the Confidential Information which it is required to disclose. 5. Ownership of Confidential Information. All rights in, and title to, the Confidential Information supplied by a Disclosing Party remain in such Disclosing Party. Neither this Agreement nor the disclosure of any Confidential Information will be construed as granting to the Receiving Party (either expressly, by implication or estoppel, or otherwise) any license or immunity under any copyright, patent, trade secret, trademark, or other intellectual property right now or hereafter owned or controlled by the Disclosing Party, or any right to use, exploit or further develop the same, except solely to effectuate the evaluation of the Potential Transaction. 6. No Further Obligations; No Violation; Export Controls. This Agreement is not intended and shall not be construed to create, any obligation to enter into any other agreement with respect to the Confidential Information or the Potential Transaction. Neither party shall be under any obligation hereunder to continue any discussions or negotiations regarding the Potential Transaction and either party may terminate such discussions or negotiations at any time without liability hereunder. Moreover, unless and until a definitive written agreement is entered into, neither party nor any of either party's Representatives shall be under any legal obligation of any kind whatsoever with respect to such a transaction except for the matters specifically set forth in this Agreement. Additionally, this Agreement does not constitute or create any obligation of either party to provide any Confidential Information or other information to the other party, rather it merely defines the duties and obligations of each party and its Representatives with respect to the Confidential Information to the extent Confidential Information may be disclosed or made available. Under no circumstances is either party obligated to disclose or make available any information to the other party, including any Confidential Information, which in its sole and absolute discretion it determines not to disclose. Each party acknowledges and understands that the other party does not need or desire to receive any Confidential Information that is government classified information, or is otherwise restricted information, the receipt, disclosure, use or retention of which is made a crime by any provision of applicable statute or the rules and regulations thereunder. The parties accordingly agree that such information will not be provided, either orally, in writing or otherwise. Neither party will transmit nor export, directly or indirectly, any technical data received from the other party, or any product utilizing any such data, in violation of applicable data export laws and regulations. 7. Competitive Activities. Each party understands that either party may have, or in the future may enter into, relationships with third parties having pre-existing relationships with the other party. Provided that each party complies with its obligations contained herein, and except as otherwise expressly provided herein, this Agreement shall not in any way limit, restrict or preclude either party from pursuing any of its present or future business activities or interests or from entering into any agreement or transaction with any person, regardless of whether such business activities or interests are competitive with the business activities and interests of the other party and regardless of whether the subject matter of any such agreement or transaction is in any way similar to or different from the transactions considered and evaluated by the parties. 8. Concurrent/Future Development. Each Disclosing Party understands and agrees that (x) the Receiving Party and its affiliates and their respective Representatives is currently or may become engaged in lines of business the same as or similar to those of the Disclosing Party and that, wholly independent of the information provided hereunder, the Receiving Party and its affiliates and their respective Representatives may currently or in the future be developing internally, or receiving from third parties, information that coincidentally may be similar to portions of the information provided hereunder and/or otherwise competitive with the Disclosing Party's actual or future projects or business, and (y) wholly independent development by the Receiving Party and its affiliates and their respective Representatives of media content, products, programs, services, goods, concepts, opportunities, documents or information that are coincidentally similar to (but not, in whole or part, based upon) any information provided hereunder will not be deemed to violate this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Section 8 is intended to relieve either party from any of its obligations of confidentiality contained in this Agreement. 9. Material, Non-public Information. Each party is aware, and will advise its Representatives who are informed as to the matters which are the subject of this Agreement, that the United States securities laws may prohibit any person who has received from an issuer any material, non-public information from purchasing or selling securities of such issuer or from communicating such information to any other person under circumstances in which it is reasonably foreseeable that such person is likely to purchase or sell such securities. 10. No Warranties. EACH RECEIVING PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT THE DISCLOSING PARTY MAKES NO WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT TO ANY MATTER RELATING TO THE CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. WITHOUT LIMITING THE GENERALITY OF THE FOREGOING, THE CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\" AND THE DISCLOSING PARTY SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ALL REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, MERCHANTABILITY AND NONINFRINGEMENT. 11. Term / Termination. This Agreement shall commence as of the date first written above and will continue in full force and effect for a period of two (2) years from the date hereof. 12. Return/Destruction of Documents. In the event that negotiations between the parties are terminated for any reason, and/or upon the Disclosing Party’s written request, each Receiving Party will forthwith either, at the Receiving Party’s option, return to the Disclosing Party or destroy or erase all Confidential Information furnished by the Disclosing Party as well as all documents, memoranda, analyses, compilations, studies, notes and other writings whatsoever prepared by the Receiving Party or its Representatives based in whole or in part on the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information. Such return, erasure or destruction shall be certified in writing to the other party by an authorized officer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the parties and their Representatives may each retain Confidential Information to the extent required pursuant to legal or regulatory requirements (including internal compliance procedures instituted to satisfy regulatory obligations), and (ii) because electronic systems may retain information for archival purposes or pursuant to automated computer backup procedures, neither party nor its Representatives shall be required to erase electronically stored Confidential Information that has been saved to a back-up file in accordance with such party or its Representatives’ ordinary electronic back-up practices; provided, that any such information so retained shall be held in compliance with the terms of this Agreement. 13. Notices. Notices required to be given by one party to the other in connection with this Agreement will be given in writing and delivered via personal delivery, recognized air courier service (e.g., Federal Express, DHL) or by facsimile with a copy sent by first class, postage paid, return receipt mail to the other party’s address set forth in the introductory paragraph of this Agreement (in the case of notices to Sony Pictures to the attention of: Corporate Legal Department (facsimile number: 310-244-2169), with a copy also to the attention of: Sony Pictures Entertainment Inc., 10202 West Washington Boulevard, Culver City, California 90232, Attention: General Counsel (fax number: 310-244-0510) and in the case of notices to the Company to the attention of: Eddie Lazarus, General Counsel (facsimile number: 312-222-4206), or such other address as a party may substitute by giving notice to the other in accordance with this Section. 14. Communications. Except with the prior permission of the other party, all communications regarding the Potential Transaction and requests for information shall be directed to Eddie Lazarus, in the case of requests regarding the Company, and Chris Mansolillo, in the case of requests regarding Sony Pictures. Each party agrees not to contact any stockholder, director, officer, employee or agent of the other party, or any customer, supplier or other person having a business relationship with the other party, regarding the Potential Transaction, except with the prior permission of the other party. 15. Assignment. This Agreement and all rights, duties and obligations hereunder are personal to the undersigned parties and may not be assigned, delegated or otherwise transferred by either party, or by operation of law, without the prior written consent of the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. Any other attempt by either party to assign or transfer this Agreement or any right or obligation herein is void and without effect and will constitute a material breach of this Agreement. This Agreement and each and every provision hereof will be binding upon and will inure to the benefit of the parties and their permitted successors and assigns. 16. Injunctive Relief. The parties acknowledge that the unauthorized use or disclosure of the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information could cause the Disclosing Party irreparable harm and that money damages may be inadequate to compensate the Disclosing Party for such harm. Accordingly, in addition to any other available remedies, the Disclosing Party will, subject to the provisions of Section 19, be entitled to seek equitable relief, including injunctive relief and/or specific performance. 17. Publicity Restrictions. Without the other party’s prior written approval, neither party will (a) make or provide any public or private statement or disclosure to any other person (other than its Representatives) concerning the existence of or any aspect of this Agreement, whether the parties have shared or made available any Confidential Information with each other, or the discussions between the parties, except to the extent such disclosure would be permitted pursuant to Section 4 of this Agreement; or (b) use the name, likeness or trademarks of the other party or its Representatives, employees or affiliates to express or imply any relationship or affiliation between the parties, or any endorsement of any product or service. For purposes hereof, the information specified in this Section 17 shall be deemed Confidential Information of each party hereunder. 18. No Partnership. This Agreement is not intended and shall not be construed to create a joint venture, partnership, agency relationship or other business association between the parties. 19. Applicable Law / Jurisdiction. This Agreement shall be construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of California without regard to the choice of law principles thereof. All actions or proceedings arising in connection with, touching upon or relating to this Agreement, the breach thereof and/or the scope of the provisions of this Section 19 other than actions or proceedings seeking equitable relief (a “Proceeding”) shall be submitted to JAMS (\"JAMS\") for binding arbitration under its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures if the matter in dispute is over $250,000 or under its Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures if the matter in dispute is $250,000 or less (as applicable, the “Rules”) to be held solely in Los Angeles County, California, U.S.A., in the English language in accordance with the provisions below. (a) Each arbitration shall be conducted by an arbitral tribunal (the “Arbitral Board”) consisting of a single arbitrator who shall be mutually agreed upon by the parties. If the parties are unable to agree on an arbitrator, the arbitrator shall be appointed by JAMS. The arbitrator shall be a retired judge with at least ten (10) years experience in commercial matters. The parties shall be entitled to conduct discovery in accordance with Section 1283.05 of the California Code of Civil Procedure, provided that (a) the Arbitral Board must authorize all such discovery in advance based on findings that the material sought is relevant to the issues in dispute and that the nature and scope of such discovery is reasonable under the circumstances, and (b) discovery shall be limited to depositions and production of documents unless the Arbitral Board finds that another method of discovery (e.g., interrogatories) is the most reasonable and cost efficient method of obtaining the information sought. (b) There shall be a record of the proceedings at the arbitration hearing and the Arbitral Board shall issue a Statement of Decision setting forth the factual and legal basis for the Arbitral Board's decision. If neither party gives written notice requesting an appeal within ten (10) business days after the issuance of the Statement of Decision, the Arbitral Board's decision shall be final and binding as to all matters of substance and procedure, and may be enforced by a petition to the Los Angeles County Superior Court or, in the case of Company, such other court having jurisdiction over Company, which may be made ex parte, for confirmation and enforcement of the award. If either party gives written notice requesting an appeal within ten (10) business days after the issuance of the Statement of Decision, the award of the Arbitral Board shall be appealed to three (3) neutral arbitrators (the \"Appellate Arbitrators\"), each of whom shall have the same qualifications and be selected through the same procedure as the Arbitral Board. The appealing party shall file its appellate brief within thirty (30) days after its written notice requesting the appeal and the other party shall file its brief within thirty (30) days thereafter. The Appellate Arbitrators shall thereupon review the decision of the Arbitral Board applying the same standards of review and all of the same presumptions) as if the Appellate Arbitrators were a California Court of Appeal reviewing a judgment of the Los Angeles County Superior Court, except that the Appellate Arbitrators shall in all cases issue a final award and shall not remand the matter to the Arbitral Board. The decision of the Appellate Arbitrators shall be final and binding as to all matters of substance and procedure, and may be enforced by a petition to the Los Angeles County Superior Court or, in the case of Company, such other court having jurisdiction over Company, which may be made ex parte, for confirmation and enforcement of the award. The party appealing the decision of the Arbitral Board shall pay all costs and expenses of the appeal, including the fees of the Appellate Arbitrators and the reasonable outside attorneys' fees of the opposing party, unless the decision of the Arbitral Board is reversed, in which event the costs, fees and expenses of the appeal shall be borne as determined by the Appellate Arbitrators. (c) Subject to a party's right to appeal pursuant to the above, neither party shall challenge or resist any enforcement action taken by the party in whose favor the Arbitral Board, or if appealed, the Appellate Arbitrators, decided. Each party acknowledges that it is giving up the right to a trial by jury or court. The Arbitral Board shall have the power to enter temporary restraining orders and preliminary and permanent injunctions. Neither party shall be entitled or permitted to commence or maintain any action in a court of law with respect to any matter in dispute until such matter shall have been submitted to arbitration as herein provided and then only for the enforcement of the Arbitral Board’s award; provided, however, that prior to the appointment of the Arbitral Board or for remedies beyond the jurisdiction of an arbitrator, at any time, either party may seek pendente lite relief in a court of competent jurisdiction, without thereby waiving its right to arbitration of the dispute or controversy under this Section. All arbitration proceedings (including proceedings before the Appellate Arbitrators) shall be closed to the public and confidential and all records relating thereto shall be permanently sealed, except as necessary to obtain court confirmation of the arbitration award. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in connection with any claim of breach hereunder, each party hereby irrevocably waives any right or remedy to seek and/or obtain injunctive or other equitable relief or any order with respect to, and/or to enjoin or restrain or otherwise impair in any manner, the production, distribution, exhibition or other exploitation of any motion picture, television or other audio-visual production related to the other party, its parents, subsidiaries and affiliates, or the use, publication or dissemination of any advertising in connection with such production; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not prohibit a party from seeking or obtaining injunctive or other equitable relief or any order based on a claim that such production uses the other party’s Confidential Information to infringe upon such party's intellectual property rights. 20. Other NDAs. The parties and certain of their affiliates are or may become party to other confidentiality agreements from time to time in connection with matters unrelated to the Potential Transaction (“Other Agreements”). Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, including Section 21(c), the parties agree that this Agreement shall apply only with respect to the Potential Transaction, and Confidential Information received and discussions occurring in connection therewith, and shall not apply to any confidential information that may be exchanged or discussions occurring in connection with any Other Agreements. 21.

(d) This Agreement may not be amended, waived or modified except by a single instrument in writing executed by duly authorized representatives of the parties. (e) This Agreement will be fairly interpreted and construed in accordance with its terms and without strict interpretation or construction in favor of or against either party. (f) For purposes of this Agreement, the term “person” shall be broadly interpreted to include without limitation any corporation, company, group, partnership and natural person. (g) In the event that any provision of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or arbitrator to be void, voidable, unlawful or for any reason unenforceable, in whole or in part, such provision will be deemed and construed to extend only to the maximum permitted by law so as to effectuate the intent of the parties, and the remainder of this Agreement will continue in full force and effect and enforceable according to its terms. (h) To the extent that any Confidential Information may include materials subject to the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or any other applicable privilege concerning pending or threatened legal proceedings or governmental investigations, each party hereto understands and agrees that both parties hereto and their Representatives have a commonality of interest with respect to such matters and it is the desire, intention and mutual understanding of both parties hereto that the sharing of such Confidential Information is not intended to, and shall not, waive or diminish in any way the confidentiality of such Confidential Information or its continued protection under the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other applicable privilege. All Confidential Information provided by either party hereto that is entitled to protection under the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other applicable privilege shall remain entitled to such protection under those privileges, this Agreement, and under the joint defense doctrine.

The parties wish to discuss a possible commercial agreement between both companies including, but not limited to ___________________________________________________________________ (the “Discussions”), which Discussions will involve the exchange of knowledge, information and know-how owned by each other. THE PARTIES AGREE AS FOLLOWS: 1. Disclosure of Confidential Information. During the course of the Discussions, the parties may, from time to time, disclose or provide to each other, in writing or otherwise, directly, or as a consequence of their business relationship, their own trade secrets, accumulated technical or business knowledge or proprietary information as well as information which either party is required to keep confidential by contractual obligations to third parties (hereafter \"Confidential Information\"). Subject to the limitations set forth in section Five (5) below, any information that the disclosing party discloses to the receiving party shall be treated as Confidential Information of the disclosing party. Each party shall disclose only that information which it believes necessary for the other's consideration. 2. Purpose of Disclosure. Each party shall utilize the Confidential Information disclosed by the other party only for the purpose of the Discussions and shall not divulge it to others or utilize it for commercial use or practice or for any other purpose whatsoever without the prior written consent of the disclosing party. 3. Precautions. The party to whom disclosure of the Confidential Information has been made (the “receiving party”) shall treat such information as confidential and shall exercise reasonable care with respect to the Confidential Information, at least to the same degree of care as the party employs with respect to protecting its own proprietary and confidential information. A receiving party shall limit disclosure of Confidential Information to those directors, officers, employees, and agents of the party who need to know the Confidential Information in connection with the Discussions and have been advised of the confidential nature of the information. 4.

Nothing in this Agreement is intended to conflict with 18 U.S.C. Section 1833(b) or create liability for disclosures of trade secrets that are expressly allowed by 18 U.S.C. Section 1833(b). 7. Ownership. Disclosing Confidential Information pursuant to the terms of this Agreement creates no ownership or license rights in the receiving party, and the disclosing party reserves all patent, trade secret and other proprietary rights it may have in such Confidential Information. 8.

Background. The Disclosing Parties may, in their discretion, provide the Receiving Party information related to their confidential and critical energy infrastructure information. NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises and covenants made herein, and with the intent to be legally bound hereby, the Receiving Party agrees as follows: 1. Confidential Information. The term \"Confidential Information\" means all written, electronic, printed or other materials disclosed by the Disclosing Parties, and all information ascertained through discussions with the Disclosing Parties, concerning the planning process.

The Receiving Party shall not make any other use, in whole or in part, of any such Confidential Information without the prior written consent of the respective Disclosing Party. The Receiving Party agrees that, in complying with its confidentiality obligations under this Agreement, it shall exercise the same care used to protect its own confidential proprietary information, but no less than reasonable care, to prevent the disclosure and to protect the confidentiality of the Confidential Information. If the Receiving Party is an individual, the Receiving Party may not disclose any Confidential information to any person or entity without the Disclosing Parties' prior written consent in each instance. If the Receiving Party is a company, the Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information (i) to the Receiving Party's directors, officers and employees (collectively, \"Representatives\"), in each case only to the extent reasonably necessary for the Receiving Party's internal use and only after informing each Representative of the restrictions in this Agreement on the disclosure and use of the Confidential Information and that he or she must comply with such restrictions, and (ii) to any other person or entity only with the Disclosing Parties' prior written consent in each instance. The Receiving Party agrees to take all reasonable steps to cause its Representatives to comply with the terms of this Agreement and to be responsible for any breach of this Agreement by any Representative. The Receiving Party shall keep all Confidential Information strictly confidential and shall not, without the respective Disclosing Party's prior written consent in each instance, disclose Confidential Information or any reports, work product or other documents containing any Confidential Information to any third party, firm, corporation or entity. Except as may be required by applicable law, without the prior written consent of the respective Disclosing Party, the Receiving Party shall not: (a) confirm or deny any statement made by a third party regarding Confidential Information and/or CEII/CII; (b) disclose to any person the fact that Confidential Information and/or CEII/CII have been made available to it; (c) confirm that any investigations, discussions or negotiations are taking place; or (d) disclose any of the terms or conditions with respect to same. If any such actions are required by applicable law, the Receiving Party shall comply with the requirements of Section 5 below. 4. Additional Provisions Relating to Disclosure and Use of CEII. The Receiving Party shall not use CEII, in whole or in part, for any purpose other than that for which the CEII was specifically provided, without the prior written consent of the respective Disclosing Party. The Receiving Party may make copies of CEII, but such copies become CEII and subject to these same terms and conditions. The Receiving Party shall not knowingly use CEII for an illegal or non-legitimate purpose. The Receiving Party agrees that, in complying with its obligations under this Agreement, it shall employ an enhanced standard of care in order to prevent the disclosure and to protect the confidentiality of the CEII. The Receiving Party shall maintain CEII in a secure manner and place and shall be responsible for ensuring that its Representatives who receive CEII do the same. The Receiving Party shall not, without the respective Disclosing Party's prior written consent in each instance, disclose CEII or any reports, work product or other documents containing any CEII to any third party, firm, corporation or entity. The Receiving Party may disclose CEII (i) only to its Representatives who have properly executed individual non-disclosure or confidentiality agreements in the course of their employment specifically pertaining to confidential information and CEII they receive in the course of their employment and (ii) only after informing each Representative of the restrictions in this Agreement on the disclosure and use of the CEII and that he or she must comply with such restrictions.. Further, such disclosure must be limited to the extent that it is reasonably necessary to evaluate the subject matter of the requested materials. The Receiving Party agrees to take all reasonable steps to cause its Representatives to comply with the terms of this Agreement and to be responsible for any breach of this Agreement by any Representative. The Receiving Party shall not disclose any CEII to any of its Representatives who have been convicted of any felony. Except as allowed under Section 5, Required Disclosure, the Receiving Party shall not submit CEII obtained from the Disclosing Parties to any government agency for any reason without first obtaining written permission from the respective Disclosing Party, and then fully complying with the requirements of 18 C.F.R. §§ 388.112, 113 for requesting special treatment of the CEII. 5. Required Disclosure. In the event that the Receiving Party is requested or required by depositions, interrogatories, requests for information or documents, subpoena, civil investigation, demand or similar process (i) to disclose any CEII or other Confidential Information received pursuant to this Agreement, (ii) to disclose any discussions pertaining thereto, or (iii) to take any other action described in the last paragraph of Section 3 above, the Receiving Party shall provide to the relevant Disclosing Parties prompt written notice of such request(s) and shall use reasonable efforts to resist disclosure until an appropriate protective order may be sought. If, in the absence of a protective order, Receiving Party is nonetheless, in the written opinion of its counsel, legally required to disclose CEII or other Confidential Information received pursuant to this Agreement, then, in such event Receiving Party may disclose such information after the Receiving Party gives the Disclosing Party written notice of the proposed disclosure and a reasonable opportunity to review the proposed disclosure. 6. Return of Documents and Destruction of Electronically Stored Information. Disclosing Parties may elect at any time to terminate further use of or access to the CEII. In such case, the Receiving Party shall return any and all CEII upon the Disclosing Party's written re(cid:84)uest, including all hardcopy originals, copies, translations, notes, reports, schematics, flowcharts, e-mails, tape recordings, or any other form of said material, without retaining any copy or duplicate supplement thereof and shall promptly destroy any and all written, printed or other material or information derived from the Confidential Information. The Receiving Party shall provide attested certification from an authorized representative confirming such return and destruction \"provided however, Receiving Party may retain one (1) copy of such documentation in its secure legal files for the sole purpose of administering its obligations under this agreement, as well as copies of electronically exchanged Confidential Information that are made as a matter of routine information technology back-up, which copies shall continue to be kept confidential in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.\" 7.

The Receiving Party also acknowledges that the interests of Disclosing Parties in such CEII may be irreparably injured by disclosure. The remedy stated above may be pursued in addition to any other remedies applicable at law or equity for breach of this Agreement. The existence of any claim or cause of action which either party may have against the other shall not constitute a defense or bar to the enforcement of any of the provisions of this Agreement. 9.

This agreement is to evidence the Receiving Party's agreement to maintain the confidentiality of the Confidential Information/CEII disclosed to it by Disclosing Parties, and shall not constitute any commitment or obligation on the part of either Party to enter into any specific contractual arrangement of any nature whatsoever. 11.

(a) For PCII - (1) Upon the completion of my engagement as an employee, consultant, or subcontractor under the contract, or the completion of my work on the PCII Program, whichever occurs first, I will surrender promptly to the PCII Program Manager or his designee, or to the appropriate PCII officer, PCII of any type whatsoever that is in my possession. (2) If the Authorized Entity is a United States Government contractor performing services in support of the PCII Program, I will not request, obtain, maintain, or use PCII unless the PCII Program Manager or Program Manager’s designee has first made in writing, with respect to the contractor, the certification as provided for in Section 29.8(c) of the implementing regulations to the CII Act, as amended. (b) For SSI and SBU - I hereby agree that material which I have in my possession and containing information covered by this Agreement, will be handled and safeguarded in a manner that affords sufficient protection to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of or inadvertent access to such information, consistent with the laws, regulations, or directives applicable to the specific categories of information. I agree that I shall return all information to which I have had access or which is in my possession 1) upon demand by an authorized individual; and/or 2) upon the conclusion of my duties, association, or support to DHS; and/or 3) upon the determination that my official duties do not require further access to such information. 6. I hereby agree that I will not alter or remove markings, which indicate a category of information or require specific handling instructions, from any material I may come in contact with, in the case of SSI or SBU, unless such alteration or removal is consistent with the requirements set forth in the laws, regulations, or directives applicable to the specific category of information or, in the case of PCII, unless such alteration or removal is authorized by the PCII Program Manager or the PCII Program Manager’s designee.

I also understand that my anonymity will be kept to the extent possible when reporting security violations. 8. If I violate the terms and conditions of this Agreement, such violation may result in the cancellation of my conditional access to the information covered by this Agreement. This may serve as a basis for denying me conditional access to other types of information, to include classified national security information. 9. (a) With respect to SSI and SBU, I hereby assign to the United States Government all royalties, remunerations, and emoluments that have resulted, will result, or may result from any disclosure, publication, or revelation of the information not consistent with the terms of this Agreement.

By granting me conditional access to information in this context, the United States Government and, with respect to PCII, the Authorized Entity, may seek any remedy available to it to enforce this Agreement including, but not limited to, application for a court order prohibiting disclosure of information in breach of this Agreement. I understand that if I violate the terms and conditions of this Agreement, I could be subjected to administrative, disciplinary, civil, or criminal action, as appropriate, under the laws, regulations, or directives applicable to the category of information involved and neither the United States Government nor the Authorized Entity have waived any statutory or common law evidentiary privileges or protections that they may assert in any administrative or court proceeding to protect any sensitive information to which I have been given conditional access under the terms of this Agreement. 11. Unless and until I am released in writing by an authorized representative of the Department of Homeland Security (if permissible for the particular category of information), I understand that all conditions and obligations imposed upon me by this Agreement apply during the time that I am granted conditional access, and at all times thereafter. 12. Each provision of this Agreement is severable. If a court should find any provision of this Agreement to be unenforceable, all other provisions shall remain in full force and effect. 13. My execution of this Agreement shall not nullify or affect in any manner any other secrecy or non-disclosure Agreement which I have executed or may execute with the United States Government or any of its departments or agencies. 14. These restrictions are consistent with and do not supersede, conflict with, or otherwise alter the employee obligations, rights, or liabilities created by Executive Order No. 12958, as amended; Section 7211 of Title 5, United States Code (governing disclosures to Congress); Section 1034 of Title 10, United States Code, as amended by the Military Whistleblower Protection Act (governing disclosure to Congress by members of the military); Section 2302(b)(8) of Title 5, United States Code, as amended by the Whistleblower Protection Act (governing disclosures of illegality, waste, fraud, abuse or public health or safety threats); the Intelligence Identities Protection Act of 1982 (50 USC 421 et seq.)

Potential Purchaser shall maintain the confidentiality of those portions of the Evaluation Materials that contain confidential and/or proprietary information, and shall not, without the prior written consent of the Company, disclose, those portions of the Evaluation Materials to any third party, except as otherwise set forth herein. Potential Purchaser may disclose the Evaluation Materials to its parents, subsidiaries, parents’ subsidiaries, or affiliates (collectively, the “Affiliated Entities”) and Potential Purchaser’s and/or the Affiliated Entities’, directors, officers, employees, partners, consultants, potential financing sources, joint-venture partners, bankers, accountants, lenders, investors, insurance consultants and/or brokers, attorneys, agents and financial and legal advisors (collectively, such entities or persons to whom Potential Purchaser or an Affiliated Entity discloses the Evaluation Materials, “Representatives”) who may need access to the Evaluation Materials, in Potential Purchaser’s discretion, for the purpose of evaluating the Proposed Transaction. Potential Purchaser shall (i) inform in writing all of its Representatives who receive any portion of the Evaluation Materials of the confidential and proprietary nature thereof and of this Agreement and (ii) direct all such Representatives in writing to comply with the confidentiality and non-use terms of this Agreement. Potential Purchaser shall keep those portions of the Evaluation Materials confidential, as hereinabove provided. 2. Potential Purchaser shall not use any of the Evaluation Materials for any purpose other than to evaluate the Proposed Transaction. The Company acknowledges and agrees that Potential Purchaser and its Affiliated Entities and Representatives may invest in or consider or manage investments in companies that compete either directly or indirectly with the Company and that this Agreement shall in no way be construed to prohibit or restrict Potential Purchaser’s or its Affiliated Entities or Representatives’ ability to make or manage or consider such investments. 3.

In the event that such protective order or other remedy is not timely obtained, or the Company waives compliance with the provisions of this Agreement, Potential Purchaser, its Affiliated Entities, and/or its Representatives may furnish and disclose any or all of the Evaluation Materials. Notwithstanding the foregoing, notice to the Company shall not be required where disclosure is in connection with a routine audit or examination by, or a blanket document request from, a governmental or regulatory authority having or claiming to have authority to regulate or oversee Potential Purchaser’s business, provided that Potential Purchaser informs such governmental or regulatory authority of the confidential nature of the Evaluation Materials. 5. It is understood and agreed that no failure or delay by the Company in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof by the Company preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any right, power and privilege hereunder. It is further understood and agreed that money damages alone may not constitute a sufficient remedy for any breach of this Agreement by Potential Purchaser or its Representatives, and that the Company shall be entitled to seek specific performance and injunctive relief, as remedies for any such breach. Such remedies shall not be deemed to be the exclusive remedies available to the Company for a breach of this Agreement by Potential Purchaser or its Representatives, but shall be in addition to all other remedies available to the Company at law or in equity. 6. Potential Purchaser shall destroy or return the Evaluation Materials to the Company (at Potential Purchaser’s option) and direct its Representatives to do the same upon the Company’s written request. If Potential Purchaser elects to destroy, Potential Purchaser shall destroy those portions of any projections, appraisals, memoranda, notes, analyses, compilations, studies and other documents, including copies or extracts thereof, that contain Evaluation Materials, prepared by Potential Purchaser and direct its Representatives to do the same, provided in each instance, the same is reasonably possible without destroying or affecting Potential Purchaser, it’s Affiliated Entities’, or its Representatives’ computer programs, server, software, or the like.

Potential Purchaser understands that the Company will endeavor to include in the Evaluation Materials information known to the Company which the Company believes to be relevant for the purpose of Potential Purchaser’s evaluation of the Proposed Transaction.

Potential Purchaser agrees that neither the Company nor its agents shall have any liability to Potential Purchaser or any of its Representatives resulting from the use of the Evaluation Materials by Potential Purchaser or its Representatives by virtue of this Agreement. 8.

Except for the matters set forth in this Agreement or in any such definitive binding agreement, neither party hereto shall be entitled to rely on any statement, promise, agreement or understanding, whether oral or written, any custom, usage of trade, course of dealing or conduct. 9. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement of the parties regarding the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous understandings, arrangements and agreements, whether oral or in writing, between the parties relating in any way to such subject matter. The terms of this Agreement shall control over any additional purported confidentiality requirements imposed by an offering memorandum, web-based database or similar repository of Evaluation Materials to which Potential Purchaser or its Representatives are granted access in connection with this Agreement, notwithstanding acceptance of such an offering memorandum or submission of an electronic signature, “clicking” on an “I Agree” icon or other indication of assent to such additional confidentiality conditions, it being understood and agreed that Potential Purchaser’s confidentiality obligations with respect to the Evaluation Materials are exclusively governed by this Agreement and may not be enlarged except by an agreement executed by the parties hereto in traditional written format. 10. This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original and all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement, provided each Party receives a signed counterpart of the other Party. Facsimile signatures or otherwise electronically transmitted signatures (such as via e-mail in pdf format) may be used with the same force and effect as original signatures. The term of this agreement shall be the earlier of: (i) six (6) months from the date hereof; or (ii) the consummation of a Proposed Transaction even if such Proposed Transaction is between the Company (or its Representatives) and a non-related third party. 11.

Such consent to disclose Proprietary Information to employees of Receiving Party or its affiliated company (“affiliated Receiving Party”) with a legitimate “need to know” and only for the purposes described in this Agreement is herewith given, but further consent shall be required for disclosure to others or authorization of use by others. For purposes of this Confidentiality Agreement, an \"affiliated Receiving Party\" means and includes a parent, if any, of Receiving Party and all present and future companies in which Receiving Party, or its parent, individually or collectively, directly or indirectly, through one or more intermediaries, owns or controls fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding stock having the right to vote for or appoint directors thereof.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, this Paragraph 3 shall survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement. 4. Immediately upon a request by the Disclosing Party at any time, the Receiving Party will turn over to the Disclosing Party all Proprietary Information of the Disclosing Party and all documents or media containing any such Proprietary Information and any and all copies or extracts thereof or upon request of the Disclosing Party, the Receiving Party shall certify in writing that all materials containing Proprietary Information (including all copies thereof) have been destroyed.

No rights or obligations other than those expressed and recited herein are to be implied from this Agreement. In particular, no licenses are hereby granted directly or indirectly under any patent, copyright, or trademark now held by or which may be obtained by, or which is licensable by Disclosing Party, including but not limited to, any license to make, use or sell any product embodying any Proprietary Information. No other existing Agreement between parties, if any, are modified or terminated by this Agreement.

Neither Party shall assign this Agreement to any third party, without the prior written consent of the other Party. 7. The Parties acknowledge and agree that due to the unique nature of the Disclosing Party’s Proprietary Information, money damages will not be a sufficient remedy for a breach of this Agreement. Because a violation of any of the provisions of this Agreement will likely cause irreparable loss and harm which cannot be reasonably or adequately compensated by damages in an action at law, the Disclosing Party will be entitled to specific performance and injunctive relief or other appropriate equitable relief as remedies for any such breach. Such remedies will not be deemed to be the exclusive remedies for a breach of this Agreement but will be in addition to all other remedies available at law or in equity to the Disclosing Party. 8. This Agreement shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of Delaware, without regard to conflicts of law principles. Any dispute, controversy and/or difference which may arise between the Parties out of or in relation to or in connection with this Agreement, or the breach thereof, which cannot be settled by amicable mutual accord without undue delay, shall be filed in the courts of Delaware. 9. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement of the Parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes and cancels all prior communications, understandings and agreements between the Parties hereto relating to the Proprietary Information, whether written or oral, expressed or implied. The Parties agree that this Agreement is severable and that in the event any provision of this Agreement is held to be illegal, invalid or enforceable, the legality, validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions will not be affected or impaired.

Confidential Information also includes, but is not limited to, personal data as defined in this Agreement or by applicable law, whichever is broader, and personal data shall not be required to be marked “Confidential” or “Proprietary” to be treated as Confidential Information under this Agreement. As used in this Agreement, “personal data” means any information relating: (i) to an identified; or (ii) to a directly or indirectly identifiable, natural person. All other information shall be deemed to be non-confidential. As used in this Agreement, an “Affiliate” with respect to a party means any entity (including without limitation any individual, corporation, company, partnership, limited liability company or group) that directly, or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, controls, is controlled by or is under common control with such party. 2. The Receiving Party agrees, except as required by law, to: (i) protect the confidentiality of the other party’s Confidential Information in whatever form maintained, including any notes, summaries, reports, analyses or other material derived by the Receiving Party, its Affiliates, or its or their Authorized Parties (defined below), in whole or in part, from the Confidential Information (collectively, “Notes”); (ii) use the Confidential Information and Notes only for the purposes of evaluating a possible Transaction and the terms thereof; (iii) use the same degree of care as with its own confidential information, which shall be at least a reasonable standard of care, to prevent disclosure of the Confidential Information and Notes, except to its Affiliates, and its or their officers, directors, employees, agents, advisors, representatives, service providers, consultants and/or subcontractors (collectively, “Authorized Parties”), solely to the extent necessary to permit them to assist the Receiving Party in evaluating the Transaction; and (iv) not disclose to persons (other than those described in clause (iii) above) that the Confidential Information has been made available, that the Receiving Party is considering a possible Transaction or that the parties have had or are having discussions or negotiations with respect thereto. The Receiving Party further agrees that prior to disclosing any Confidential Information to its Affiliates, or its or their Authorized Parties, as allowed hereunder, such Affiliates and/or Authorized Parties will be advised of the confidential nature of the Confidential Information, provided a copy of this Agreement and directed to abide by its terms. The Receiving Party agrees to be responsible for any breach of this Agreement by it, its Affiliates, or its or their Authorized Parties.

Accordingly, in the event of any such breach, in addition to any other remedies at law or in equity that a party may have, it shall be entitled to seek equitable relief, including injunctive relief or specific performance or both (although neither party shall be entitled to any special, consequential, indirect, punitive or exemplary damages as a result of a breach of this Agreement, whether a claim is asserted in contract, tort, or otherwise). Obligations in this Section 2 regarding Confidential Information shall, with respect to each disclosure of Confidential Information hereunder, continue for three (3) years from the date of each disclosure of Confidential Information. Nothing herein is intended to limit or abridge the protection of trade secrets under applicable trade secrets law, and trade secrets shall be maintained as such until they fall into the public domain. 3.

If either party decides not to proceed with a Transaction, it will promptly inform the other party of that decision. In addition, the Disclosing Party may elect at any time by notice to the Receiving Party to terminate further access to and such party’s review of the Confidential Information. In any such case or upon any other termination of this Agreement, the Receiving Party will immediately: (i) return all Confidential Information disclosed to it and (ii) destroy, with such destruction to be certified by the Receiving Party, all Notes, without retaining any copy thereof. No such termination of the Agreement or return or destruction of the Confidential Information or Notes will affect the confidentiality obligations of the Receiving Party, its Affiliates, or its or their Authorized Parties, all of which will continue in effect as provided in this Agreement. 5.

If either party or any of their respective Affiliates or Authorized Parties is requested or required, by interrogatories, subpoena or similar legal process, to disclose any Confidential Information or Notes, such party agrees to provide the Disclosing Party with prompt notice of each such request, to the extent practicable, so that the Disclosing Party may seek an appropriate protective order, waive compliance by the Receiving Party with the provisions of this Agreement, or both. If, absent the entry of a protective order or receipt of a waiver, the Receiving Party is, in the opinion of its counsel, legally compelled to disclose such Confidential Information or Notes, the Receiving Party may disclose such Confidential Information or Notes to the persons and to the extent required without liability under this Agreement and will use its best efforts to obtain confidential treatment for any Confidential Information or Notes so disclosed. 7.

Except as provided herein, the parties agree that any disclosures contemplated hereunder, and any discussions or communications between the parties relating thereto, shall not restrict either party’s right to take whatever future actions such party unilaterally determines to be in its best interests, including the right to discontinue discussions with the other party at any time or to undertake similar discussions or to enter into agreements or relationships with third parties covering subjects related to the matters covered herein. All provisions of this Agreement are severable, and if any provision or part thereof is deemed invalid or otherwise unenforceable, then such term shall be construed to reflect the closest lawful interpretation of the parties’ original intent, and the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall remain valid, enforceable and binding. This Agreement may be executed in multiple counterparts, each of which, when executed and delivered, shall be deemed an original, but all of which shall constitute one and the same instrument. Any signature page of any such counterpart, or any facsimile transmission thereof, may be attached or appended to any other counterpart to complete a fully executed counterpart of this Agreement, and any facsimile transmission of any signature of a party shall be deemed an original and shall bind such party. The Receiving Party shall notify the Disclosing Party immediately upon discovery of any loss, unauthorized disclosure or use of the Confidential Information and/or Notes or any other breach of this Agreement by the Receiving Party, its Affiliates, or its or their Authorized Parties. In any such event, the Receiving Party shall help the Disclosing Party in every reasonable way to regain possession of the Confidential Information and/or Notes and shall prevent any further unauthorized disclosure or use. This Agreement will be binding on and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns. Except for the foregoing, neither party may assign this Agreement or any of their rights and obligations hereunder or delegate the performance thereof to a third party without the prior written consent of the other party. Except as stated herein, nothing in this Agreement is intended to confer any benefit to any third party or any right to enforce any term of this Agreement.
