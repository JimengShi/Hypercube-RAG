We share the information described above in Section 2 with our third party service providers, as necessary for them to provide their services to us and help us perform our contract with you. Service providers are third parties (other companies or individuals) that help us to provide, analyze and improve our Services. While 23andMe directly conducts the majority of data processing activities required to provide our Services to you, we engage some third party service providers to assist in supporting our Services, including in the following areas: Order fulfillment and shipping. Our payment processor processes certain Registration Information, such as your billing address and credit card information, as necessary to enable you to purchase a 23andMe kit from the 23andMe.com online store. Our distribution centers ship your kit(s) to you, and in some cases help return your kit safely to our third party laboratory so your sample can be processed. Our CLIA-certified genotyping lab. To use our genetic testing services, you must purchase, or receive as a gift, a 23andMe Personal Genetic Service testing kit, and ship your saliva sample to our third party laboratory. Once delivered, receiving personnel at the laboratory remove and discard kit packaging, which in some cases may contain \"sender information\" (eg, name, address), before testing personnel receive the samples for processing. Receiving personnel do not perform testing, and testing personnel handle saliva samples that are only identified by a unique barcode. When the laboratory has completed their analysis, they securely send the resulting Genetic Information to us identified by your unique barcode. During kit registration, you are asked to review our Consent Document for Sample Storage and Additional Genetic Analyses. Unless you consent to Biobanking and additional analyses, your saliva sample and DNA are destroyed after the laboratory completes its work, subject to the laboratory's legal and regulatory requirements. Should you wish to update your sample storage preference to discard a stored sample, you can do so within your Account Settings once your sample has completed processing. As detailed further in Section 5.d. (Account Deletion) our contracted genotyping laboratory will retain certain information as necessary to comply with applicable regulatory and legal obligations. Customer Care support. Our Customer Care team uses a number of tools to help organize and manage the requests we receive. These tools help to ensure we provide timely, high quality support. Cloud storage, IT, and Security.

Our IT and security providers assist with intrusion detection and prevention measures to stop any potential attacks against our networks. We have these third party experts perform regular penetration tests and periodically audit 23andMes security controls. Marketing and analytics. When you use our Services, including our website or mobile app(s), our third party service providers may collect Web-Behavior Information about your visit, such as the links you clicked on, the duration of your visit, and the URLs you visited. This information can help us improve site navigability and assess our Marketing campaigns.

NOTE: Our service providers act on 23andMe's behalf. We implement procedures and maintain contractual terms with each service provider to protect the confidentiality and security of your information. However, we cannot guarantee the confidentiality and security of your information due to the inherent risks associated with storing and transmitting data electronically. \"Targeted advertising\" service providers We permit third party advertising networks and providers to collect Web-Behavior Information regarding the use of our Services to help us to deliver targeted online advertisements (\"ads\") to you. They use cookies and similar technologies, to gather information about your browser's or device's visits and usage patterns on our Services and on other websites over time, which helps to better personalize ads to match your interests, and to measure the effectiveness of ad campaigns. For more information about our marketing practices, please review our Cookie Policy. Aggregate information We may share Aggregate Information, which is information that has been stripped of your name and contact information and combined with information of others so that you cannot reasonably be identified as an individual, with third parties. This Information is different from \"Individual-level\" information and is not Personal Information because it does not identify any particular individual or disclose any particular individuals data. For example, Aggregate Information may include a statement that \"30% of our female users share a particular genetic trait,\" without providing any data or testing results specific to any individual user. In contrast, Individual-level Genetic Information or Self-Reported Information consists of data about a single individual's genotypes, diseases or other traits/characteristics information and could reveal whether a specific user has a particular genetic trait, or consist of all of the Genetic Information about that user. 23andMe will ask for your consent to share Individual-level Genetic Information or Self-Reported Information with any third party, other than our service providers as necessary for us to provide the Services to you. Information we share with commonly owned entities We may share some or all of your Personal Information with other companies under common ownership or control of 23andMe, which may include our subsidiaries, our corporate parent, or any other subsidiaries owned by our corporate parent in order to provide you better service and improve user experience. Generally, sharing such information is necessary for us to perform on our contract with you. We may provide additional notice and ask for your prior consent if we wish to share your Personal Information with our commonly owned entities in a materially different way than discussed in this Privacy Statement. As required by law Under certain circumstances your Personal Information may be subject to processing pursuant to laws, regulations, judicial or other government subpoenas, warrants, or orders. For example, we may be required to disclose Personal Information in coordination with regulatory authorities in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements. 23andMe will preserve and disclose any and all information to law enforcement agencies or others if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary to: (a) comply with legal or regulatory process (such as a judicial proceeding, court order, or government inquiry) or obligations that 23andMe may owe pursuant to ethical and other professional rules, laws, and regulations; (b) enforce the 23andMe Terms of Service and other policies; (c) respond to claims that any content violates the rights of third parties; or (d) protect the rights, property, or personal safety of 23andMe, its employees, its users, its clients, and the public.

There are limits to what the Certificate of Confidentiality covers so please visit the Certificates of Confidentiality Kiosk. Business transactions In the event that 23andMe goes through a business transition such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets your Personal Information will likely be among the assets transferred. In such a case, your information would remain subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Statement. Access to your account We provide access to your 23andMe data within your 23andMe account. You can access and download data processed by 23andMe within your Account Settings and within applicable Reports, Tools, and features.

You may be able to correct Self-Reported Information entered into a survey, form, or feature within your account, such as on the surveys page, by clicking Edit your answers here. Please note that you may not be able to delete User Content that has been shared with others through the Service and that you may not be able to delete information that has been shared with third parties. Individuals located in Designated Countries should review Section 9.e. to understand their rights to access Personal Information. Marketing communications As noted in Section 3.h. you may be asked to opt-in to receive product and promotional emails or notifications when creating your 23andMe account depending on where you are located. Otherwise, you may view or update your email notification preferences by visiting your Account Settings or by contacting our Privacy Administrator at privacy@23andMe.com. You can also click the \"unsubscribe\" button at the bottom of promotional email communications. Sharing outside of the 23andMe Services You may decide to share your Personal Information with friends and/or family members, doctors or other health care professionals, and/or other individuals outside of our Services, including through third party services such as social networks and third party apps that connect to our website and mobile apps through our application programming interface (\"API\"). These third parties may use your Personal Information differently than we do under this Privacy Statement. Please make such choices carefully and review the privacy statements of all other third parties involved in the transaction. 23andMe does not endorse or sponsor any API applications, and does not affirm the accuracy or validity of any interpretations made by third party API applications. In general, it can be difficult to contain or retrieve Personal Information once it has been shared or disclosed. 23andMe will have no responsibility or liability for any consequences that may result because you have released or shared Personal Information with others. Likewise, if you are reading this because you have access to the Personal Information of a 23andMe customer through a multi-profile account, we urge you to recognize your responsibility to protect the privacy of each person within that account. Users with multi-profile accounts (i.e., where multiple family members register their kits to one account) should use caution in setting profile-level privacy settings. Account deletion If you no longer wish to participate in our Services, or no longer wish to have your Personal Information be processed, you may delete your 23andMe account and Personal Information within your Account Settings. Once you submit your request, we will send an email to the email address linked to your 23andMe account detailing our account deletion policy and requesting that you to confirm your deletion request. Once you confirm your request to delete your account and data, your account will no longer be accessible while we process your request. Once you confirm your request, this process cannot be cancelled, undone, withdrawn, or reversed. When your account is deleted, all associated Personal Information is deleted and any stored samples are discarded, subject to the following limitations: Information previously included in 23andMe Research. As stated in any applicable Consent Document, Genetic Information and/or Self-Reported Information that you have previously provided and for which you have given consent to use in 23andMe Research cannot be removed from completed studies that use that information. Your data will not be included in studies that start more than 30 days after your account is closed (it may take up to 30 days to withdraw your information after your account is closed).

De-identification/Pseudonymization. Registration Information is stripped from Sensitive Information, including Genetic and Self-Reported Information. This data is then assigned a randomly generated ID so an individual cannot reasonably be identified. Encryption. 23andMe uses industry standard security measures to encrypt Sensitive Information both at rest and in transit. Separation of Environments. 23andMe ensures processing, production, and research environments are separated and access is restricted. Data, including Registration Information, Genetic Information, and Self-Reported Information are segmented across logical database systems to further prevent re-identifiability. Limiting access to essential personnel. We limit access to Personal Information to authorized personnel, based on job function and role. 23andMe access controls include multi-factor authentication, single sign-on, and strict least-privileged authorization policy. Detecting threats and managing vulnerabilities. 23andMe uses state of the art intrusion detection and prevention measures to stop any potential attacks against its networks. We have integrated continuous vulnerability scanning in our processes and regularly engage third party security experts to conduct penetration tests.

(b) Social Media Information:If you sign in to your Viber account through third-party social media sites like Facebook, Twitter or VK, you agree to give us on-going access to your personal information on such sites (eg, your public profile, friend list, accounts you follow or who follow you, your email address, birthday, work history, education history, interests, current city, and video viewing). We may receive certain information about you which is stored on social media sites if users of those sites give us access to their profiles and you are one of their friends or connections, depending upon your settings on those sites. (c) Activity Information:While using the Viber Services, we will collect, and other users can see, your connection status, whether you have received and seen messages sent to you, if you are currently on another call, and information related to the calls and messages you have sent and received such as length of the call, who called who, who messaged who, and at what time; if you do not want people to know that youre online or that youve seen messages, you can change these options in your settings. As for delivered status and call information (length of the call, missed calls etc), we believe they are important for other Viber users and therefore cannot be canceled. For Secret Chats, we will notify the other members of any screenshots youve been taking (so please respect the vibe and do not take them). We will receive interaction information from your use of our Services. When you interact with Public Accounts, bots and Communities on our Service, we may obtain information about the messages you have liked, comments you have left and also websites youve viewed through links in them. When you use our Chat Extensions and shopping solution we may know which items you searched and shared. In addition, we collect information about the accounts you have visited and the content you have viewed in order to improve the relevance of our Services. We collect information about the value added services you are using over Viber and/or apps (such as games) you have downloaded through Viber. This includes whether you are presently online, your personal preferences (such as connecting the service to Viber) and the way you use that service (for example how often, for how long). We may also tell other Viber users that you are using a certain service or app (to recommend them to try that service as well). (d) Information from Other Sources:The information we collect may be combined with information from outside records (eg demographic information and additional contact information) that we have received in accordance with the law. (e) Additional Information:We collect additional information when you access our App through a certain device (eg your mobile devices unique identifier; information about your devices operating system, your browser, browser or operating system language; your wireless network, and your mobile carrier; the Viber call log). We may also collect your WPS location data you can choose whether to allow this by changing your geolocation tracking settings. Viber Out Account Registration:Our Viber Out service allows you to call a number outside of the Viber registered community at low cost local rates. If you want to useViber Out, youll need to create a Viber Account by selecting a password, and providing certain personal information (eg, name, email and billing information). We will also keep your Viber Out call detail records for billing and legal records, and to make you relevant offers. When calling through Viber Out, just like regular phone calls you make, details of the call are available to the phone operator of the person you called (and possibly other facilitating phone operators but this is the same as any regular phone call you make). Linking your email to Viber and Rakuten group: When you select to connect your email to your Viber account, we will use information you provided in the registration process (eg, name, email, password, phone number), as well as your IP address to do so. When we link your email account to the Viber account, we will also automatically create an account for you with our parent company, Rakuten Inc., and other entities in the Viber corporate family (Group) if you do not already have an account with one of the services. Certain registration and activity data will be shared with the Rakuten corporate family as part of this process, as described below. You can choose to delink your Viber account from the Rakuten account at any time by editing your profile on the app. Our mission is to constantly improve our Services and provide you with new experiences. As part of this mission, we use your information for the following purposes: (a)Make our service available: We use your Registration and Account information to (i) register you for the App and create your User Account for Viber; (ii) create your profile and make it visible; (iii) process your payments; (iv) create your Viber ID; (v) provide customer service, give you information about your account, and respond to your requests; (vi) personalize your experience by providing content (such as games) on the Service, including targeted advertising of Viber services and other 3rd party services that we believe may be of most interest to you; personalization may include automated decisions about what you will view and when, but be assure that it will not have legal effects on you (vii) indicate which of your contacts is already a Viber member and notify you when your contacts become active on the Service (viii) display the name of the contact as it appears in your address book when a call is received on the Service, and (ix) sync your contacts with Viber running on Windows, MacOS, Linux, Android tablets, iPads and Windows Tablets. If you deactivate your Viber account, it will delete the address book from our servers (more about this below), quickly and permanently. Otherwise, we keep your contact information for as long as you use the App so we can provide you all functions of the app. (b) Improve our Services:We use call log information and usage information (as described above) to better understand network behavior and trends (numbers of messages and calls made by users, typical destinations, call lengths, network type, etc), detect potential outages and technical issues (this helps us notice things like a drop in call volume in a certain geography, a shift in call length, a change in typical networks, etc) to improve our Services. (c) Provide Interesting Offerings to You and others: As part of value added services provided by us or by a third party within Viber, we may use your information to continuously optimize and personalize those services and send you personal updates about new offerings which we believe you will find relevant. We may share with our service providers unique identifiers to determine the best way to tell potential new users about our services. When you join Viber, the contacts in your address book that are already Viber members may be informed that youre now on Viber too. Sending amessage to a bot or Public Account, subscribing to a bot or Public Account will allow admins of that bot or Public Account to send you notifications and personal messages. If you do not wish to receive such notifications, you may adjust your account settings to decline them or opt-out at any time from receiving further notifications. You will be asked to allow the use of your location data before Viber provides you specific location services offerings, and you may also adjust your phone preferences to disable the use of your location data at any time. (d) Process Your Payments: We may use your Information like your name and phone number to process your payments for our Services through a secured third-party service provider and, on an aggregate basis to determine charges for our phone carriers and other service providers. (e)Prevent Fraud & Spam; enforcement of law: We really want Viber to be free of spam and fraudulent content so that you feel safe and free. We may use your information to prevent, detect, and investigate fraud, security breaches, potentially prohibited or illegal activities, protect our trademarks and enforce ourTerms of Use. This may include URLs included in messages, which were reported as SPAM by other users, or were otherwise suspected to be unsolicited and using your operating system authentication services. We may use automated decisions to close an account based on such data and other logic we have created for this, in order to protect other users and prevent recurring breaches. If your account has been blocked you can contact our support. We may use your information and call log information to comply with applicable laws. (f) Communicate With You: As part of the Viber family, we want to keep in touch with you. We use your information to contact you (via message or other means) to maintain the App, including your Viber Out User Account, to comply with your stated communication preferences or to provide updates about other Viber services. Data Retention: Unless otherwise specified, we retain information as long as it is necessary and relevant for us to achieve the purposes referred to above or to enable us to comply with our legal data protection retention obligations. Upon deactivation of your account, we will minimize the personal data we keep about you only to such data which we are required to keep to comply with laws, or other legal reasons. We may keep activity data on a non-identifiable basis to improve our services. Your posts on public accounts and communities may remain available if you do not delete them.

The information provided in your registration, if you link your email to the Viber account, will be shared with Rakuten group to create the Rakuten account and/or to link your Rakuten account with your Viber account. Data about your use of the Viber Service and Rakuten group services will also be shared to the joint account. The purpose of this practice is to provide joint content and a better service from us and the group, and allow you to enjoy from the Rakuten ecosystem benefits, as well as for fraud prevention and personalization of the services,and any other purpose described in the privacy policy of the other Rakuten group company providing the service. You can choose to delink your Viber account from the Rakuten account at any time by editing your profile on the app. (b) App Providers and Other Third-Parties:We may disclose your information to service providers and other third-parties under contract who help with providing you and others our Services on our behalf or other services provided by third-parties via our Services (such as, but not limited to, fraud and spam investigations, payment processing, site analytics and operations, providing special partnership features in our service either on an aggregate non identifiable basis, or using a unique identifier which is not attributable to you). They are required to secure the data they receive. (c) Advertising partners: to enable the limited advertisements on our service, we may share a unique advertising identifier that is not attributable to you, with our third party advertising partners, and advertising service providers, along with certain technical data about you (your language preference, country, city, and device data), based on our legitimate interest. This includes partners managing our advertising placements and also advertisers themselves and their agencies or third parties managing their advertising demands.

(d) Legal and Law Enforcement: We may disclose your information to law enforcement, governmental agencies, or authorized third-parties, in response to a verified request relating to terror acts, criminal investigations or alleged illegal activity or any other activity that may expose us, you, or any other Viber user to legal liability. (e)Change of Control New Owners: We may share your information with another business entity, if we plan to merge with or be acquired by that business, or are involved in a transaction with similar financial effect. In such a situation we would make reasonable efforts to request that the new combined entity or other structure follow this Policy with respect to your personal information. If your personal information was intended to be used differently, we would ask the new entity to provide you with prior notice. Because Viber is global, the recipients above may be located outside the country in which you are located. See the section on International Data Transfers below for more information. Some of our Services allow you to share information with others on a public basis. If you post information on a public feature of our Services or through social media sites, plug-ins or other applications, do not forget this information is public on our Services and, depending upon your privacy settings, may also become public on the Internet. When you post on Communities, the admin of the Community has the ability to allow everybody to access it, but you can always actively delete messages you posted. We cannot prevent or control further use of this information so please make sure you only post information that youre happy to be seen publicly. We may also further use such public information you share, for various reasons, such as improving our service and providing you with relevant content, and analyzing trends. You can control what data you share through privacy settings available on some social media sites. Please refer to those third-party sites privacy policies and terms of use to learn more about their privacy practices, as we do not control these. At this stage, whatever you share publicly is available to the entire Viber community. If you wish to remove a certain piece of content you have shared in the past, you can do that by deleting that content. It will be removed from our services but may remain on local devices of some users (assuming they have chosen to save it). We want you to have control over how you communicate. That is why, for example, we allow you to delete messages even after they have been sent (it will be deleted for you, your friend and our service). How cool is that? You can also control your privacy settings within the App to change the visibility of your online status or prevent other users from knowing which Viberapps and games you are using. You can disable the seen notification so that other users do not know whether youve read a message yet. You can choose not to share your photo, opt not to receive location-based messages along with many other additional options, which are available within the app. You can also make additional choices on your phones settings by changing our apps permissions such as location sharing, access to contact list and more. Every now and then, Viber may send you updates about administration and operation of the Service (for example, about your transactions, policy changes, technical issues, etc). We may also send notifications about offerings by Viber or third-parties, that we think may be of interest to you. If you do not wish to receive such notifications, you may adjust your system settings to decline them. When you visit the App and/or our Website, we and our business partners may use cookies and other tracking technologies for a variety of purposes.

We may share (i) aggregated information (information about you and other users collectively, but not specifically identifiable to you); (ii) anonymous information; and (iii) certain technical information (including IP Addresses and mobile device IDs) to develop and deliver targeted advertising in the Games and on the websites of third parties. We may also allow advertisers to collect these types of information within the Games and they may share it with us. Advertisers may collect this information through the use of tracking technologies like browser cookies and web beacons. The information collected may be used to offer you targeted ad-selection and delivery in order to personalize your user experience by ensuring that advertisements for products and services you see will appeal to you, a practice known as behavioral advertising, and to undertake web and mobile analytics (i.e. to analyze traffic and other end user activity to improve your experience). We may disclose aggregated and anonymous information to describe the Services to prospective partners, advertisers, and other third parties, and for other lawful purposes. We may use aggregate, non-personally identifiable information for our own internal promotion or marketing purposes and we may share such aggregate non-personally identifiable information with others for marketing purposes. Our Services may contain advertisements from companies other than PeopleFun that may link to their own websites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites. If you have any questions about how these other websites use your information, you should review their policies and contact them directly.

For Accounts registered directly with PeopleFun profile information is initially only available from the device that was used for registration. If another device attempts to access your user information an email will be sent to the email address on record and you must grant approval to the new device by responding to that email. It is important that you protect and maintain the security of your Account and that you immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of your Account. We encrypt the transmission of all information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). While we take certain precautions against possible security breaches of our Services, no website or Internet transmission is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee that unauthorized access, hacking, data loss, or other breaches will never occur. Although we strive to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data while it is being transmitted through our Services; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we have procedures and security features in place to try to prevent unauthorized access. Any information that is collected via our Services is covered by the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is collected. If we decide to make material changes to our Privacy Policy, we will notify you and other users by placing a notice on PeopleFun.com or by sending you a notice to the e-mail address we have on file for you, and well update the Last Updated Date above to indicate when those changes will become effective. We may supplement this process by placing notices in the Games and on the Site. You should periodically check www.PeopleFun.com and this privacy page for updates. We do not share personal information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless you affirmatively agree to such disclosure, typically by opting in to receive information from a third party that is participating in a sweepstakes or other promotion through our Services. If you do ask us to share your personal information with a third party for its marketing purposes, we will only share information in connection with that specific promotion, as we do not share information with any third party (other than our service providers) on a continual basis. To prevent disclosure of your personal information for use in direct marketing by a third party, do not opt in to such use when you provide personal information through our Services. Our Services may contain links to websites and services that are owned or operated by third parties (each, a Third-party Service). Any information that you provide on or to a Third-party Service or that is collected by a Third-party Service is provided directly to the owner or operator of the Third-party Service and is subject to the owners or operators privacy policy. Were not responsible for the content, privacy or security practices and policies of any Third-party Service. To protect your information we recommend that you carefully review the privacy policies of all Third-party Services that you access. In September 2013, California enacted amendments to the California Online Privacy Protection Act (California Business & Professions Code 22575-22579) which require operators of websites to disclose how they respond to do not track (DNT) signals from browsers used by consumers or other mechanisms that provide consumers a choice regarding the collection of personally identifiable information about the consumers online activities over time and across different websites or online services. While some newer browsers have incorporated Do Not Track features which, when turned on, send a signal or preference to the web sites you visit indicating that you do not wish your online activity to be tracked, a DNT protocol that can be implemented across multiple devices and sites has not yet been widely adopted. Currently, our computer system does not support, and cannot act on DNT signal headers that we may receive; accordingly, the choices that we provide you concerning out collection and use of personally identifiable information will continue to operate as described in this policy. Your personal information may be transferred to, and maintained on, computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. If youre located outside the United States and choose to provide your personal information to us, we may transfer your personal information to the United States and process it there. If you have any questions, comments or concerns regarding our Privacy Policy and/or practices, please send an e-mail to privacy@PeopleFun.com.
