{"query_id": "hydrology_query_98", "content": "What factors influence the spatial and temporal variations of solute concentrations in rivers within arid watersheds?", "answer_list": ["Evapotranspiration and hydrologic connectivity to local solute stores significantly influence the spatial and temporal variations of solute concentrations in rivers of arid watersheds."], "relevant_doc_list": []}
{"query_id": "hydrology_query_99", "content": "What are the mechanisms of runoff generation in watersheds and how do they influence flood forecasting models?", "answer_list": ["The mechanisms of runoff generation in watersheds include saturation-excess runoff and infiltration-excess runoff, which influence flood forecasting models by determining the patterns and dynamics of water flow during rainfall events."], "relevant_doc_list": []}
