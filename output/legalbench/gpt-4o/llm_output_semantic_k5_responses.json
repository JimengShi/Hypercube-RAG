This aligns with exceptions to confidentiality found in sections of the provided documents, such as when information is obtained from a source that is not bound by confidentiality restrictions. Each document may have specific clauses regarding this; for example:\n\n- Document 2 (Section 3) states that the Receiving Party can consider such information non-confidential if it becomes available to the Receiving Party from a source not under confidentiality obligations.\n- Similarly, Documents 1, 3, and 4 also include comparable exceptions to the confidentiality obligation. \n\nFor precise confirmation about any specific agreement, the exact document's terms must be referenced.",
