However, in the context of the documents provided, similar agreements (e.g., Document 1, Document 2, Document 3, Document 4, and Document 5) generally require the Receiving Party to notify the Disclosing Party if they are required by law, regulation, or judicial process to disclose any Confidential Information. For example:\n\n- **Document 1 (Dominion Energy NDA)**: Section 5 (\"Required Disclosure\") specifies that the Receiving Party must provide prompt written notice to the Disclosing Party if disclosure is required by law, allowing the Disclosing Party to seek a protective order or other remedy.\n- **Document 2 (UW Oshkosh NDA)**: Section 5 states that the Receiving Party must notify the Disclosing Party before disclosing Confidential Information required by law, to allow the Disclosing Party to seek protective measures.\n- **Document 3 (AfriGIS NDA)**: Clause 8.4 requires the Receiving Party to notify the Disclosing Party and take steps to protect the Confidential Information if disclosure is required by law.\n- **Document 4 (NCDG NDA)**: Clause IV.4 requires prior written notice to the Disclosing Party if disclosure is required by law.\n- **Document 5 (Signal Energy NDA)**: Section 3 (\"Required Disclosure\") requires the Receiving Party to notify the Disclosing Party promptly if disclosure is required by legal or regulatory authority, allowing the Disclosing Party to seek a protective order.\n\nIf VELCO's NDA follows a similar structure, it is likely to include a similar requirement.",
