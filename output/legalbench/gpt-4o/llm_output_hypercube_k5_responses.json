However, it allows the Receiving Party to retain one copy in its secure legal files for the sole purpose of administering its obligations under the Agreement.\n\n- **General NDA (e.g., Document 5):** Similar provisions exist where the Receiving Party must return or destroy all Confidential Information, including copies, and confirm such destruction in writing if requested by the Disclosing Party, except for information retained due to legal requirements or in non-retrievable electronic archives. \n\nThe obligation to destroy or return Confidential Information is a common clause in NDAs to ensure confidentiality even after the termination of the agreement.",

However, analyzing standard clauses in NDAs, Receiving Parties are usually allowed to acquire similar information from a third party if that third party lawfully provides the information and is not bound by confidentiality obligations in favor of the Disclosing Party. This principle is reflected in several of the given documents. For example, information that is independently developed, already known to the Receiving Party, or obtained from another source without a violation of confidentiality agreements is typically excluded from the definition of Confidential Information.

If this does not answer your query, further clarification or the actual \"Street Stream\" NDA document would be required for a precise response.",
