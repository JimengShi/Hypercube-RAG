    "predicted_answer": "The provided documents do not discuss an EFCA Non-Disclosure Agreement, so no specific information about EFCA's NDA or its stance on independently developing similar information is available here. However, in general, the NDAs in the documents allow the Receiving Party to develop information independently if it is not derived from the Confidential Information disclosed. This is evident in the exceptions for confidentiality in the NDAs, such as independently developed information, as stated in Document 1 (Clause 2.2.d), Document 2 (Clause 1.i), and Document 3 (Clause 6.b.iii).
